My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2025 Second Quarter Webcast.\nHere today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President, Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.\nOur earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2025 second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just 1 question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today.\nWe direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measures and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As all of you are aware, this will be my last earnings call for Stanley Black & Decker, given our recent announcement that Chris Nelson will become the CEO effective October 1.\nI want to begin by sincerely thanking our shareholders, employees and customers for your continued trust and support throughout my tenure. Your commitment has been foundational to our progress and success, especially over the last 3 years.\nI believe now is the right moment to initiate this leadership transition, as I'm excited about how the team will build upon the significant company-wide transformation progress we have made since the summer of 2022. So in full alignment and with the support of our Board of Directors, I will move into the Executive Chair role, where I'll remain fully committed to supporting Chris and the company.\nI couldn't be more confident that Stanley Black & Decker has done a firm foundation for future growth and in excellent hands under Chris' leadership. As we move through the final year of our multiyear supply chain transformation and I reflect on the progress over the past 3 years, we have significantly advanced the vision we set forth during the spring of 2022.\nWe stabilized, simplified and focused the organization. As a result, we have and are continuing to improve our cost position, capitalize on our core strengths and prioritize investments designed to accelerate organic growth. We have assembled a strong management team with the right people in the right roles across the organization, blending experience in our business and the industry with an infusion of new perspectives from experienced dynamic talent.\nWe streamlined our portfolio of iconic brands and businesses by divesting $2.6 billion of revenue. We have honed our focus on the core strengths of our portfolio of tools and outdoor and engineered fastening, which are both well positioned in very attractive industries that are forecasted to grow over the long term.\nFinally, we have significantly improved our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet through solid execution against our operational priorities set in mid-2022. Our simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains with iconic brands such as DEWALT.\nAnd today, the capabilities we built to our supply chain transformation are supporting the company as we navigate tariffs with agility and speed. As we continue to return our company to sustainable organic growth, we are deeply committed to fostering a growth-oriented culture within the organization.\nBy enhancing our strong foundation of operational excellence and building a sustainable productivity engine, we are enabling resource allocation to fund future growth. Our investments are designed to continue driving innovation within our categories, accelerate organic growth through targeted local market initiatives and deliver new value-added solutions to our customers.\nStanley Black & Decker has long been an innovator and a growth-oriented company. We have the team to take this company forward. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to continue supporting the company and to see this next chapter of growth unfold in the quarters ahead, while we close out the final phase of the supply chain transformation in 2025, continue to drive towards our margin goal of 35-plus percent and achieve our deleveraging goal in 2026, the additional modest streamlining of the existing businesses portfolio.\nNow turning to our second quarter 2025 performance. Revenue was $3.9 billion, down 2% versus the previous year and down 3% organically. The quarter was impacted by a slow outdoor buying season and nontypical shipment disruptions related to our customers' reactions to tariffs, which contributed to a dynamic operating environment.\nAgainst that backdrop, we delivered solid second quarter revenue with continued growth of our DEWALT brand supported by relatively resilient professional demand. Encouragingly, U.S. tools end user demand was resilient and stayed relatively consistent on a total dollar basis following our price increases.\nFirst half organic revenue was down 1%, and we believe it will remain relatively flat in the second half as well. The second quarter adjusted gross margin rate was 27.5%, down versus last year due to a 3-point gross margin impact from tariffs and lower volume. This was partially offset by supply chain transformation efficiencies and the partial impact on our initial round of price actions, which became effective within the second quarter.\nDespite market volatility, adjusted gross margin for the first half was 28.9%, just 20 basis points behind the prior year. As you will hear from the team today, the organization is remaining focused on executing our robust plan designed to mitigate tariffs.\nWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters. We believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies. We view these initiatives in conjunction with capturing the remaining supply chain transformation savings as the primary drivers to return our adjusted gross margin trajectory toward our goal of 35-plus percent.\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.1%, down 260 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the gross margin change and our growth investments, which were partially offset by targeted cost control measures. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.08, inclusive of a discrete tax benefit.\nSecond quarter free cash flow was $135 million, a strong result considering the operational impact of new trade policies. Overall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment with significant credit to the global Stanley Black & Decker team; as together, we all continue to make meaningful progress on what is within our control.\nThank you for your support. I will now pass it to Chris, who will review the business segment performance and provide more context on how we successfully execute our strategy in a volatile trade environment.\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of the entire Stanley Black & Decker team, I would like to begin by expressing our appreciation to Don for his leadership and dedication to the company over the past 26 years. His deep connection with our customers and brands, coupled with his unwavering commitment to our global team, has been instrumental in positioning the company for lasting success.\nI'd also like to personally thank him for his partnership over the past 2 years and has helped preparing me for this moment. Looking ahead to October 1, I am honored and excited to become CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, an iconic American company with a proud heritage and a bright future. The opportunity to work with our teams around the world to unlock the tremendous potential of our brands and drive share gain in the marketplace is energizing and I look forward to doing so in collaboration with our valued channel partners.\nNow turning to our second quarter operating performance. Our top priority continues to be serving our customers and accelerating initiatives to mitigate tariff-related headwinds, all while keeping our long-term financial objectives in sight.\nBeginning with Tools & Outdoor, Revenue for the quarter was approximately $3.5 billion, representing a 2% decline as compared to the second quarter of 2024. Organic revenue decreased by 3% and price realization of 2% represents a partial quarter of benefit from our late April U.S. price actions.\nVolume was down 5% due to a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. We were encouraged to see continued top line expansion of the wall professional products as Pro demand remained relatively resilient. This marks over 2 years of consistent growth from our powerhouse DEWALT brand, which year-to-date has grown in every product line and region.\nWe clearly see the benefits from our prioritized innovation, marketing and activation investments. Our growth and share gain strategy is underpinned by accelerating DEWALT's success while we work to restore consistent share gain in Stanley & Craftsman.\nAdjusted segment margin was 8%, a 240 basis point decline as compared to the second quarter of last year. The change was attributable to the impact from tariffs, lower volume and investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by the supply chain transformation efficiencies, price and cost control. Shifting to performance by product line.\nPower Tools organic revenue growth of 1% was driven by price, resilient Pro demand and solid performance in our key investment markets.\nHand Tools organic revenue decline of 5% was primarily attributable to tariff-related shipment disruptions in North America. Outdoor organic revenue declined 7% related to a slow buying season. Demand has picked up in July, but our expectation is that 2025 will carry a modest decline near our minus 1% year-to-date performance.\nNow evaluating the tools and outdoor regions. In North America, organic revenue declined by 4%, driven by factors consistent with the segment's overall performance. Channel inventory remained in line with historical levels. POS dollar trends in Tools remain stable, while outdoor POS was slow to start and improved throughout the quarter.\nNotably, following the recent price increases, we did not observe a shift in buying trends. which signals relatively healthy end demand. In Europe, organic revenue declined by 1%. Growth in the U.K. in key investment markets such as Central and Eastern Europe, helped offset softer market demand in Germany and Italy.\nThe Rest of World delivered 1% organic growth, driven by Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East, led by strong performance from our professional brands.\nNow let's transition to Engineered Fastening. On a reported basis, second quarter revenue was down 2% versus prior year and 1% on an organic basis, 1% of price realization and 2% of currency favorability was more than offset by 2% of volume declines and a 3% impact related to the previously disclosed product line transfer to the Tools & Outdoor segment.\nThe Automotive business experienced a mid-single-digit organic decline primarily due to reduced production schedules and restrained capital expenditures by OEMs. General Industrial Fasteners organic revenue declined high single digits. The Aerospace business had another strong quarter with over 20% organic growth driven by strong performance in fasteners and fittings products. This business has achieved a new high of $400 million annualized run rate revenue with a solid multiyear backlog and growth outlook.\nThe Engineered Fastening adjusted segment margin rate was 10.8% for the quarter. This is a decline from the previous year, largely due to softness in the higher-margin automotive fasteners.\nIn summary, with focused execution, our team's accelerated cost control measures and adjustments to our supply chain to neutralize the impacts from tariffs as quickly as possible within the period.\nImplementation of our robust and flexible plans to mitigate tariffs is ongoing, as we navigate this dynamic operating environment. We have entered the final innings of our multiyear supply chain transformation. Successfully completing the transformation this year remains a top priority and is fundamental to optimizing our cost structure, advancing customer-focused innovation and driving our growth initiatives.\nThese efforts are all aimed towards delivering profitable organic growth and sustainable market share gains. With respect to cost management, we are continuing to execute a comprehensive series of initiatives expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in pretax run rate cost savings with $1.5 billion attributable to improvements within our supply chain.\nWe have clearly identified the principal sources of incremental savings and are making steady progress towards our full year 2025 target of $500 million in cost reductions. In the second quarter, we achieved approximately $150 million in pretax run rate cost savings, bringing our total savings to approximately $1.8 billion since the program's inception.\nWe remain committed to strengthening our culture of operational excellence and building our sustainable productivity engine. These efforts are essential to further improving customer fill rates, funding growth investments and achieving our long-term goal of maintaining an adjusted gross margin of 35% or higher.\nI will now take a moment to highlight a Pro-focused innovation we recently introduced. As a leader in total job site solutions, DEWALT is advancing its construction technology offerings of productivity solutions for trade contractors with MSuite. MSuite is a cloud-based management software which improves coordination between building information modeling, fabrication and field construction teams.\nMSuite helps users track, manage and share data throughout the entire life cycle of a construction project. We introduced the MSuite Hangers automation tool in May as 1 of 3 product offerings on the platform. This software solution redefines how our targeted mechanical, electrical, plumbing and industrial contractors approach hanger layout and modeling.\nIt delivers significant efficiency improvements as they route building systems like pipes, ducks, conduits and cable trays. Early adopters of MSuite Hanger software are already reporting remarkable gains in productivity. For instance, what traditionally took 10 manual steps and a disproportionate amount of time within the building information modeling project is now a single automated step.\nThis system simultaneously adjusts to building system model changes by adding or removing hangers and rapidly creates simple or complex configurations. Additionally, it can generate bills of material for fabrication, streamlining hanger installation. These functionalities enhance accuracy, save important coordination time in the field and reduce the costly risk of errors.\nThis innovative tool enables the user to design their job using DeWALT hardware solutions, including DEWALT anchors and TOUGHWIRE. These kinds of comprehensive workflow solutions help DEWALT to win with the professional on commercial and industrial job sites. We are building a future where technology empowers end users on every job site to drive productivity with greater accuracy and confidence while also expanding the breadth and depth of our solutions.\nAs we continue executing with an end user and customer-first mindset, we are focused on balancing the near-term needs of the business with preserving and delivering long-term growth, share gain and shareholder value. As we navigate this environment, we're taking the necessary measures to stay on our margin trajectory.\nUltimately, a key milestone of success is achieving 35% or greater adjusted gross margins. Consistent with this aim, we are prioritizing our efforts to successfully navigate tariffs. As we have previously shared, our tariff mitigation strategy is guided by 4 key principles.\nFirst, our primary commitment is to serve our customers and end users as we navigate this evolving environment. We are collaborating with our customers to develop the optimal product assortment for our end users given the new landscape. Additionally, we are prioritizing high service levels and supply continuity.\nSecondly, we are accelerating supply chain adjustments to leverage our North American footprint and attain USMCA compliance rates that are in line with other manufacturing-based industries. Our current plan is expected to reduce our Chinese production for the U.S. to less than 5% by the end of 2026.\nThird, we are taking a judicious approach to price actions, maintaining a long-term perspective as we make the adjustments necessary to protect our cash flow, EBITDA and margin structure while supporting investments for growth. Our April price increase was implemented on plan and began contributing during the second quarter.\nWe are in the initial stages of customer discussions and intend to implement a second more modest increase early in the fourth quarter. Finally, we continue to proactively engage with the U.S. administration to ensure our interests and those of our stakeholders are expressed and considered, as they work to achieve their trade-related goals.\nIn summary, our disciplined approach positions us to address immediate challenges while building a strong foundation for future growth and returning to our targeted margin trajectory.\nI will now pass the call to Pat Hallinan to lay out our financial assumptions for tariffs in our current planning scenario.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I would like to emphasize the importance of the strategic countermeasures that we are actively implementing. These coordinated efforts across our global teams are essential to protect our business, as we advance towards our long-term financial objectives, inclusive of growth and margin accretion.\nWe currently estimate the annualized gross tariff cost from policy actions is approximately $800 million, excluding mitigation actions. The factors that underpin our cost estimates incorporate the most recent policy changes announced in July and those expected to be enacted within the next few days.\nThese assumptions include 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico, over 20% in aggregate on goods from the Rest of the World and 50% Section 232 metal tariffs. However, the impact on our 2025 P&L is expected to be partially mitigated through a combination of ongoing targeted initiatives in addition to strategic pricing measures.\nTaken together, we currently estimate the net P&L impact for our 2025 to be approximately $0.65, reflecting the timing and costs required to implement mitigation strategies. In this estimate, we have included costs to accelerate the planning and execution of our supply chain initiatives as well as the anticipated increase in expenses required to manage current rare earth supply constraints.\nIn the appendix, we have included an illustration that is consistent with prior disclosure of our U.S. cost of goods sold by country of origin to assist in modeling sensitivities relative to these assumptions.\nNow to unpack our remaining planning assumptions. Our earnings outlook for the year includes GAAP earnings per share of $3.45, plus/minus $0.10. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $4.65. Pretax non-GAAP adjustments are estimated to range between $205 million and $250 million, primarily related to the supply chain transformation and other cost actions that will benefit SG&A.\nLooking ahead, our planning is based on the generally stable demand trends experienced throughout much of this year. These include relatively strong professional demand, continued relative softness in the DIY and outdoor product lines and a certain degree of retailer disruptions associated with efforts to optimize sourcing and product assortment in response to tariffs.\nThese are underpinned by our readiness to respond with agility and speed to changes in the operating and market backdrop. We anticipate 2025 total company sales to attract slightly as compared to 2024. Year-over-year organic revenue is expected to be in line with the total company, as price increases are offset by the aforementioned volume pressures.\nBack half organic revenue is planned to be relatively flat, largely consistent with the performance we delivered in the first half. Our top line elasticity assumptions suggest an approximate one-for-one relationship between price and volume, meaning that each incremental point of price is expected to be offset by a corresponding point of volume decline.\nCurrency is now projected to contribute a positive 1 percentage point, which will be offset by the first quarter comparable impact from the infrastructure divestiture. Organic revenue for the Global Tools & Outdoor segment is projected to decline approximately 1 point. The Engineered Fastening segment is anticipated to achieve 1% organic growth, driven by sustained momentum in aerospace.\nOur supply chain transformation initiative maintains an incremental 2025 cost savings target of $500 million. Back half adjusted gross margin is assumed to deliver year-over-year expansion in both quarters, with the fourth quarter to show slightly stronger performance, taking into account our transformation and tariff mitigation actions.\nAssuming that future tariff announcements lead to only modest adjustments and the U.S. government makes meaningful progress on rare earth initiatives, we believe we can sustain this positive momentum and adjusted gross margin into 2026.\nWe remain dedicated to investing in high-growth, high-return opportunities, and we'll reinvest over $100 million in 2025 to drive market activation, strengthen our brands and support commercial expansion. Full year adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand year-over-year on the strength of gross margin, supported by the cost actions that we are implementing.\nOther 2025 modeling assumptions, which are relatively similar to prior assumptions, are noted on the slide. In the near term, we anticipate that third quarter organic revenue will present a 1 percentage point decline, as we manage the impact of global tariff disruptions in conjunction with the subdued consumer DIY market environment.\nFor the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to represent approximately 25% of the full year adjusted EPS contribution factoring in a decline in organic revenue, balanced with a solid step forward in gross margins.\nWith respect to cash flow and capital management, we remain committed to disciplined oversight of working capital and capital expenditures, targeting approximately $600 million in free cash flow in 2025. This objective is supported by disciplined inventory management with an emphasis on customer order fulfillment alongside prudent expenditure controls.\nCash generation will be utilized to fund our dividend with the remainder intended to be used for debt repayment. Deleveraging continues to be a top priority, as we are committed to maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet and working towards achieving less than or equal to 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nOur plan to achieve this outcome includes using excess free cash flow and an assumed $500 million to $1 billion in proceeds from portfolio pruning for further debt repayment.\nTo conclude, we are pleased with the performance we have delivered in the first half of the year, responding decisively to external challenges through targeted operational and supply chain adjustments, underscoring our unwavering commitment to meeting the needs of our end users and customers.\nThe organization has demonstrated exceptional agility in this environment. The organization's efforts have put us in a position to quickly restore profitability while taking the measures to position Stanley Black & Decker for sustained growth, margin expansion and long-term value creation.\nThank you, and I will now return the call to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve as CEO of Stanley Black & Decker and work alongside an extraordinarily talented and resilient team. As I have said many times, Stanley Black & Decker is built on the strength of our people, iconic brands and a powerful innovation engine.\nThese foundational attributes transcend external market conditions, and I am confident that these traits are what position Stanley Black & Jacke to thrive well into the future and generate sustainable long-term growth and value creation.\nWe are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2025 First Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President, Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.

I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by recognizing that our transformation is working. And we are focused on seeing it through to completion to drive sustainable market share gains. With operations excellence at our core, we believe the actions we are taking improve our ability to seize the long-term opportunities within the attractive markets that we serve.\nAs I've said many times, Stanley Black & Decker has incredibly talented people, powerful brands and an amazing innovation machine. These foundational traits have made us an industry leader for many years. Over the past 3 years, we have built strong capabilities in our supply chain, which we intend to draw upon as we continue to navigate this moment. We also have been investing significantly in our end users and channel customers to provide the best innovation, service and experience. We intend to continue investing in growth and innovation even in this dynamic period. We've been planning for some time for the possibility that U.S. trade policy would change significantly and outlined a three-pronged execution plan of supply chain mitigation, price increases and partnering with the U.S. administration.\nWhile the magnitude and frequency of these changes has exceeded our expectations, we have been and remain prepared to address this dynamic trade environment, and we are responding. As you will hear from the team today, we have a plan for tariffs and have been executing on key elements that will help us mitigate the impact on our business. Over the past several years, we have substantially reduced our China manufacturing footprint, which serves the U.S. market. We believe we have the most flexible supply chain footprint in the industry as we now have significant hubs in the U.S., Mexico and Southeast Asia that serve the U.S. market.\nAs we navigate these shifts in trade policy, we are starting from a strong position due to these existing hubs. We intend to build upon them to minimize the impact of higher input costs from tariffs over the next 12 to 24 months. Price increases will be necessary in the U.S. market due to the current tariffs, and we have implemented a substantial increase in April. We have and plan to continue to invest time with the U.S. administration as they work to achieve the President's trade goal. Now I want to focus on our performance this quarter. I'm pleased to report that the company's first quarter represented another step forward against our transformation.\nWe delivered a solid start to the year with organic revenue growth and year-over-year gross margin expansion both key measures of continued progress towards our strategic objectives. Organic growth was up 1%, led by solid outdoor performance. Our powerhouse and professionally focused DeWalt brand extended its streak of year-over-year revenue growth. with power tools, hand tools, accessories and storage and outdoor all contributing. These organic growth drivers were more than offset by 2 points of pressure from the final quarter of lapping the infrastructure business divestiture and 2 points of currency pressure.\nTaken together, this resulted in total revenue of $3.7 billion, consistent with our plan. North American end market demand, as measured by our retail POS in the first quarter was generally consistent with the stable trends we observed exiting 2024. The year started slow but March improved, and April looks solid as well. Adjusted gross margin continued to improve on a year-over-year basis. The first quarter adjusted rate of 30.4% was up 140 basis points versus last year. Supply chain efficiencies and positive mix benefits from new innovation launches were partially offset by freight inflation and the initial impact from China and Mexico tariffs initiated in February.\nWe are firmly executing against our strategic objectives and are on track with our transformation plan. We intend to successfully complete our transformation in 2025 and meet our $2 billion savings target. The organic growth we delivered in the first quarter along with the year-over-year gross margin expansion translated into solid adjusted EBITDA performance, net of growth investments, adjusted EBITDA margin approached 10%, an increase of approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.75, up 34% versus last year.\nFirst quarter free cash outflow was $485 million, relatively consistent with both the prior year and typical historical seasonality. An impressive result considering we pursued targeted inventory investments to navigate the current trade situation. Overall, a solid quarter as we continue to make meaningful progress on what is within our control. I want to thank the organization for staying focused on execution and making forward progress once again.\nWe clearly are entering a dynamic period with reduced visibility, albeit with relatively stable demand based on what we're seeing in the market and across the business. While we don't know the full picture of how tariffs will impact the U.S. economy or demand in our categories, we are preparing ourselves for multiple demand scenarios this year. And even though it's too early to predict all the different direct and indirect impacts, as I mentioned earlier, we do believe the current trade policies will prompt significant price increases for companies in our industry and many others.\nWe will continue to monitor these evolving policies as well as project the potential effects on the operating and demand environment to remain agile and responsive to evolving market conditions. Over the past few years, we have strengthened our execution capability and have consistently delivered results in an overall weak market backdrop. Our strategic decisions are aimed at navigating the immediate challenges while positioning the company for sustained long-term success. Our top priorities remain clear and intact. We are accelerating our growth culture and placing a priority on serving our end users and customers. We expect to control costs while prioritizing growth investments as we continue our journey to sustainable share gain. We also expect commercial opportunities to emerge for our businesses, particularly as we further leverage our North American footprint to serve local markets.\nWe remain focused on generating cash and strengthening our balance sheet. Long term, we intend to mitigate the cost burden of tariffs through supply chain adjustments and other cost controls, some of which are already in flight, while some will take time to fully implement. As such, pricing is a necessary initial response to protect our cash flow so that we have time for the full effect of our supply chain strategies to hit our P&L, and we can continue to fuel innovation.\nIn this context, as I mentioned earlier, we implemented an initial U.S. tools and outdoor price increase in April and notified our customers that further price action is likely required if existing tariffs stay at current levels. To summarize, even in the current circumstances, we believe we are decisively advancing towards the successful completion of our strategic transformation, building a sustainable productivity engine to fund growth investments and support our long-term margin journey.\nThe capabilities we've built during this process will aid in accelerating adjustments to adapt to the new economic backdrop. Chris will share more about the near-term opportunities that we are pursuing in just a moment. Pat then will share more detail on financial planning. Given the fluid environment today, we are providing our latest thoughts on 2025 with sensitivities to help model different scenarios. We have our sights set on share gains and long-term value creation and are committed to making the necessary decisions along the way to achieve our long-term financial objectives.\nI will now pass it to Chris Nelson, who will review the business segment performance and provide more context on how we successfully execute our strategy in a volatile trade environment.\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the Tools and Outdoor first quarter operating performance. Revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, flat versus the first quarter of 2024. Organic revenue grew 1% driven by volume. DEWALT was a key contributor to this performance in the quarter with revenue up mid-single digits. Driven by professional demand, the brand achieved its eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. In addition, we had strong outdoor product shipments ahead of the season. .\nThese positive factors were partially offset by a cautious consumer and continued softness in the DIY market. Adjusted segment margin was 9.6%, a 110 basis point improvement as compared to the first quarter of last year. This was largely attributable to supply chain efficiencies and new innovation benefits. Partially offsetting this was freight inflation, the initial impacts from incremental tariffs announced during the first quarter and targeted investments in growth initiatives.\nTurning to performance by product line. Power Tools experienced a 2% organic revenue decline as the consumer DIY category remained pressured. Hand tools achieved 1% organic revenue growth supported by strong reception from customers of new products designed with an end user-centric mindset to improve their productivity. A couple of examples include the DEWALT Construction Jack, which offers hands-free lift assistance and the DEWALT [indiscernible] System 2.0 DXL modular workstation system.\nOutdoor posted 6% organic growth led by a return to normal seasonal load-ins with our channel partners as well as new listings and expanded spring promotional placements at our retail partners. Focusing on tools and outdoor performance by region, North America recorded a 2% organic revenue increase, reflecting the overall segment's growth factors. As Don stated, total quarter U.S. POS demand was stable and that continued into April. We are tracking demand closely and looking for signs of change in consumer behaviors, especially as our first round of price increases begin to hit the shelf.\nEurope organic growth was flat. As our investments in Eastern Europe are yielding results, which counteracted a generally weak market backdrop due to macro factors. Rest of World organic revenue was down 3% as Latin America was comping robust growth last year. Based on current underlying market demand, we expect to return to growth in the coming quarters.\nIn summary, the growth in margin performance was a solid start to 2025 and was in line with our plan for the segment. Now let's transition to Engineered Fastening, which was our former Industrial segment. We made this name change to reflect the segment's more focused portfolio. On a reported basis, first quarter revenue for Engineered Fastening was down 21% versus prior year. 16 points of the decline was attributable to the final quarter of lapping the infrastructure business divestiture. Other factors impacting revenue included a 1 point increase in price, 2 points of volume pressure, 2 points of currency pressure and a 2-point decline due to a product line transfer to the Tools & Outdoor segment.\nAll told, there was a slight organic revenue decline of 1%. The automotive business faced a high single-digit organic decline, primarily due to OEMs reducing light vehicle production schedules and tightening capital expenditures. The aerospace business generated robust mid-teens organic growth, driven by strong performance in fasteners and fittings. This business has a multiyear backlog and growth outlook, reinforced by new content wins in a high booking rate. General industrial fasteners achieved low single-digit organic growth, reflecting steady demand.\nThe Engineered Fastening adjusted segment margin rate was 10.1% for the quarter. This is a decline from the previous year, largely due to softness in high-margin automotive products. successfully completed our transformation in 2025 remains a top priority and is core to improving our cost structure, advancing customer-focused innovation and driving our growth initiatives with the underlying objective of generating profitable and sustainable market share gains.\nAs it relates to costs, we continue actively implementing our series of initiatives, which are projected to yield approximately $2 billion of pretax run rate cost savings, of which $1.5 billion is coming from the supply chain. We have identified the key sources of savings this year and are progressing down the path towards our 2025 full year target of $500 million of savings. In the first quarter, we achieved approximately $130 million in pretax run rate cost savings, bringing our total savings to approximately $1.7 billion since the program's inception.\nWe continue to enhance our strong culture of operational excellence and build a sustainable productivity engine both of which we believe are critical to funding growth investments and achieving our long-term 35% plus adjusted gross margin goal. Accelerating our growth culture is also key. Our teams are focused on further enhancing service for our end users and customers as we continuously improve our supply chain. The right side of the page highlights 2 examples of how we are seizing opportunities with priority end users in attractive markets and concentrating investments behind our core brands.\nOne key initiative is increasing DEWALT penetration in Saudi Arabia, a market in which we've historically been underweight. We are taking a local and focused market activation approach to serve our customers and gain market share in a region that is experiencing robust construction growth. One strategy we're pursuing to drive growth is portable job site containers that operate as mobile service stations. These containers offer a range of efficiency driving solutions, including training, tool repair and loan and purchase options to reduce downtime on the job site.\nThis quarter, we also launched DEWALT Tough wire, a versatile cable hanger system, revolutionizing HVAC sheet metal, electrical and plumbing trade applications with customizable suspension solutions. Informed and inspired by our professional end users, this system is designed to improve efficiency and simplify installations. These are just 2 examples of many across our portfolio to illustrate how we are innovating with purpose and addressing unique challenges of trades people with safe, productivity enhancing and durable solutions. We believe we are taking the right actions to thoughtfully and aggressively prioritize resources to deliver consistent, profitable share gain.\nLike many companies with global supply chains, we are currently navigating a frequently changing and complex operating environment. As we take decisive actions, our goal is to position the business for success with focus on achieving our long-term financial objectives. It is crucial that we balance meeting the near-term needs of the business with preserving and maximizing long-term value, all while maintaining our customer-first mindset. Our business teams are continuously assessing the evolving trade policies and diligently evaluating their impacts on our global supply chain and our business. In October of last year, we outlined how we were enhancing our preparations to mitigate the potential impact of higher tariffs. And we have continued to stay true to our plans and the 4 guiding principles behind them.\nFirst and foremost, we are committed to serving our customers and end users during this dynamic period. Our end users core needs don't change with changes in the macroeconomic environment. They still demand solutions that deliver high performance, safety and productivity. We intend to be here for them and to continue to invest responsibly in growth and innovation, even in this dynamic period. Second, we are working to minimize the impact of higher input costs from tariffs by accelerating the repositioning of our supply chain. We estimate this to be a 12- to 24-month process and we believe there are adjustments that could begin to contribute to reducing the impact this year. Today, approximately 15% of our supply chain for the U.S. comes from China. Through our mitigation efforts, we're focused on effectively being out of China supply for the U.S. business in the 12- to 24-month time period.\nThis is a high priority and will remain a key focus even if China tariffs go to lower levels. We also have plans to increase our USMCA compliance from where it stands today at just below 1/3 of Mexico's supply for the U.S. Third, we are moving with speed on price increases. We are taking a judicious approach maintaining a long-term perspective as we make the adjustments necessary to protect our cash flow, EBITDA and margin structure.\nFinally, we continue to engage with the U.S. administration as they work to achieve their trade-related goals. Turning to the current situation, you can see our production mix from the U.S., Mexico and China that we've previously disclosed to help size the potential impact of changes in policy. It's important to note that we have developed a flexible footprint to leverage as trade policy evolves. Of the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in supply from the rest of the world, 75% of that is comprised of 4 countries: Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.\nAdditionally, our long-held local for local manufacturing and distribution strategy strongly resonates today with greater than 60% of our costs located in North America. We believe we have created a flexible and industry-leading footprint for global tools and outdoor companies that can be a competitive advantage in this environment. A few updates on the mitigation actions. First, on price. In April, we successfully implemented a high single-digit average price increase across our United States retail partners. Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter.\nAs it relates to our supply chain moves, the teams are actively prioritizing projects that we believe deliver the highest value at the quickest pace. For example, we have opportunities in our supply chain to move dual-sourced SKUs out of China and into Mexico. Additionally, we are pursuing relatively straightforward supply adjustments to increase the amount of USMCA qualified product coming from Mexico. With all that in mind, based on our understanding of trade policies as it stands today, our current estimated 2025 headwind net of mitigation is approximately $0.75 on an adjusted EPS basis.\nIn addition to pursuing mitigation actions, we are also evaluating new commercial opportunities, which leverage our U.S. plants. We manufacture a significant amount of outdoor, hand tools, storage and engineered fasteners in America. We will remain agile as the policy landscape evolves. And in a moment, Pat will outline more details for scenario planning purposes. When presented with an environment like this current one, it requires strong coordination across our enterprise to ensure our response is well orchestrated and timely, and I'm proud of how our teams are coming together to find creative, impactful solutions. We are thoughtfully and aggressively navigating the path forward as we focus on serving our customers, optimizing our cost structure and protecting cash flow as we position the business to achieve its long-term potential. These environments present as many opportunities as there are challenges, and we are squarely focused on both.\nThank you. And I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Chris. And greetings to everyone on the call today. I'm going to devote the majority of my prepared remarks to discussing how we are approaching the current environment. Before I do, I just want to reiterate that we are encouraged by the progress we achieved in the first quarter, marked by organic revenue growth, gross margin expansion and continued advancement towards our strategic financial objectives.\nNow turning to the balance of the year. As is well covered at this point in the earnings cycle, many companies are navigating the uncertainty stemming from rapidly evolving trade policies. In response, Stanley Black & Decker intends to remain nimble and strive to counter the effect of tariffs with measures within our control, such as supply chain adjustments and price. We will leverage the internal team we assembled during 2024 to enable our organization to address tariffs while keeping our strategic objectives in focus. Our teams have conducted extensive internal planning to prepare for a range of scenarios during 2025 and beyond and to facilitate our response.\nToday, we will present the scenario against which we are executing. To note, we are not macro forecasters, and we have not endeavored to formulate a holistic macro forecast or call a U.S. recession. Though our scenario planning does contemplate a continuation of the persistently soft DIY landscape and considers tactical adjustments retailers may make as they navigate tariffs. We believe we are prepared to adapt to changes in the economy and in our end markets if such events come to pass. Our planning assumptions incorporate the current in-effect policy as of April 29, which includes 145% incremental tariffs on China. 25% on non-U.S. MCA compliant goods from Mexico, 10% for the rest of the world and the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum.\nOur commercial and operational mitigation strategies we believe are designed to protect both cash generation and margins in response to the anticipated approximately $1.7 billion of estimated gross annualized tariffs. To be clear, this amount is not what we expect to hit our P&L this year or even next year, after taking into account cost mitigation and price. We estimate the 2025 net earnings per share headwind after supply chain adjustments and price increases to be $0.75. The impact to 2025 is primarily due to the time required to activate pricing with our customers and the P&L cost of tariffs, the timing of which is impacted by inventory accounting.\nOur ultimate goal is to strive to mitigate fully these headwinds. Since supply chain adjustments require time to implement, pricing actions are the quickest countermeasure at our disposal. In addition to supply chain and price actions, we anticipate capturing cost savings in the core business from the final phase of our transformation plus incremental SG&A cost containment. Our intent is to protect growth investments that we believe will drive long-term share gains and generate positive returns. By remaining agile and pulling levers primarily within our control, we remain focused on delivering our long-term margin journey.\nTurning to our planning assumptions for 2025. We entered this period in a relatively stable demand environment characterized by consistent pro demand and DIY softness and with aggregate U.S. tools and outdoor customer inventory levels consistent with historic norms. It is of paramount importance to uphold our service levels to customers while we take the necessary actions we've discussed to protect the business as the trade environment evolves.\nOur 2025 GAAP earnings per share planning scenario is $3.30 plus or minus $0.15, which translates to adjusted earnings per share of approximately $4.50. Full year GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $195 million to $260 million. Adjusted earnings per share within our current planning assumption is $0.75 lower compared to the February pre-tariff view. The main factor is the aforementioned net headwinds from tariffs.\nAdditionally, the negative impact from volume is fully offset by incremental SG&A cost containment, favorable currency and a modest benefit to below-the-line items. We are managing capital spending and working capital to be responsive to the underlying environment with a plan for free cash flow to meet or exceed $500 million assuming the operational characteristics of this planning framework. In our planning scenario, total company sales is forecasted to increase low single digits and organic revenue growth is planned for low to mid-single-digit expansion, driven by an assumption for mid-single-digit price, which is partially offset by a low single-digit decline in volume. Currency and the infrastructure business divestiture, combined are expected to be a low single-digit headwind to sales versus the prior year.\nWhen looking at the segment level, global tools and outdoor organic revenue is forecasted to expand low to mid-single digits, now driven by price rather than volume. Note, U.S. tools and outdoor carries the greatest magnitude of price and volume tariff impacts from mid-second quarter through December, and therefore, the percentage magnitude of price and volume impacts within the U.S. business is expected to be greater than that for the overall segment during the second half.\nEngineered Fastening is expected to contribute low single-digit organic revenue growth. We believe these are prudent assumptions, taking into account the impact of higher interest rates on housing and the soft DIY consumer, our price increases and the potential short-term tactical decisions that customers may make as they respond to tariffs. To help those who want to model volume or cost sensitivities against our planning assumptions, we have provided additional context.\nIt is our expectation that a 1 percentage point change in U.S. volume would result in roughly a $0.13 impact to adjusted earnings per share. This assumption contains decrementals to 20% to 25% with cost control or similar incremental net of growth investment. Our intent is to contain the profit downside to these levels, depending on the magnitude of any volume shifts. In the event of tariff reductions, the benefit would be from the relief date through the duration period when these mitigations are assumed to be an impact. Regarding our cost savings strategy, we anticipate achieving $500 million in supply chain cost savings in 2025, in addition to an assumption for savings from tariff mitigation actions.\nAdditionally, we are striving to reduce SG&A, while protecting the priority growth investments contemplated in our '25 plan. Under these assumptions, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA margin rate to expand year-over-year. As it relates to the second quarter, we are planning for flat to low single-digit organic revenue decline and an expectation for positive adjusted pretax earnings. The second quarter will carry a heavy tariff burden due to LIFO. In an environment characterized by reduced visibility and frequent changes, our top priorities are unchanged.\nWe are committed to advancing towards our long-term strategic and financial goals and do not believe policy changes impact our ability to achieve those over time. Our effort to successfully finish the supply chain transformation in 2025 is pivotal in supporting gross margins and we are now pivoting to growth and striving to accelerate the company's share gain capabilities. Finally, robust cash conversion and strengthening our balance sheet remain top priorities as we work to achieve our multiyear deleveraging goal.\nWhile tariffs present a considerable challenge in the near term, they do not detract from our long-term shareholder value creation opportunity. We believe we are making the right adjustments to the company that are strategically designed to position us for sustained long-term growth, margin expansion and value creation.\nWith that, I will now return the call to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, we are committed to continuing to make meaningful progress across our top priorities. Accelerating our growth culture to serve our end users and customers, generating cash and strengthening our balance sheet; and progressing the transformation to support our long-term margin journey. While we don't know the ultimate trade policy outcome, by thoughtfully preparing and being pragmatic in our decision-making, we believe we can successfully manage through the changing environment. We believe the actions we are taking today are positioning the company to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Michael Wherley. Mr. Wherley, you may begin.\n\nMichael J. Wherley\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter call.

I am honored and energized to be leading Stanley Black & Decker as we embark on our next chapter of growth.\nSince joining the team over 2 years ago, we have focused our businesses on where we want to compete, the end users we want to serve and the markets where we can be a leader. This work has been about being more selective so that we invest our resources in the places where we see the most significant opportunities and greatest ROI for our businesses. We show up every day for our customers and end users to deliver what they need when they need it. Through everything we do, this will continue to be our North Star.\nOver the last few years of transformation, Stanley Black & Decker has solidified our foundation and sharpened our focus. I am proud of the dedication and collective effort that our team of approximately 48,000 employees strong has contributed to get us here. Our ambition is to build a world-class branded industrial company by solving our end users' most pressing and complex challenges.\nWe go to market with a portfolio of iconic brands, and innovation is in our DNA. We have strong connections with customers and end users, and our brands open doors and afford access to opportunities in geographies around the world. These foundational attributes, combined with the renewed focus achieved through our transformation, have positioned us to win across industries poised for long-term growth.\nStanley Black & Decker has made tremendous progress towards the objectives we established at the outset of our strategic transformation. We achieved these results despite a rapidly shifting operating environment, evolving consumer demand dynamics and trade policy fluctuations. With the operational proficiency and agility we have developed through our strategic transformation, we can now serve our customers and end users more effectively and efficiently.\nWith a strong foundation firmly in place and with a significantly simplified and focused business, we believe our future success will now be determined by how effectively we execute our strategy. This presents us with the compelling opportunity to deliver attractive returns for our investors while benefiting all stakeholders.\nAs we look forward, we are on track to successfully deliver the $2 billion cost reduction targeted when we began our transformation over 3 years ago by year-end 2025. Our next priority is to achieve 35% adjusted gross margin while further strengthening our balance sheet. We will build on our capabilities and strong financial foundation as we execute our 3 strategic imperatives: activating our brands with purpose, driving operational excellence and accelerating innovation. I want to spend a few minutes going into each of these focus areas to give you a better sense of what will drive our profitable organic growth going forward.\nThe first imperative is activating our brands with purpose. We have pivoted from a product-led marketing approach to a brand-led market-back approach to reinvigorate our organic growth. This included creating a closer feedback loop between our brands and end users and prioritizing innovations that will address end users most pressing needs. Our core brands, DEWALT, STANLEY and CRAFTSMAN, each have a distinct identity, and we maintain this differentiation along with clearly defined target end users. This strategic segmentation informs how we prioritize resources and investment in key brands and focused trades. In addition, it enables broad coverage of the total addressable market, with specific and productive solutions that uniquely address the needs of end users, ranging from commercial and industrial professionals, to residential construction contractors and ambitious DIY enthusiasts.\nOur organic growth strategy is anchored on accelerating DEWALT's performance, while maintaining a strong focus on delivering consistent above-market results in STANLEY and Craftsman. DEWALT's mission is to serve the world's most demanding professionals. Supported by a more data-driven, targeted approach, our commercial teams are executing locally and focusing on the most attractive growth opportunities with trade-specific initiatives.\nTo amplify our presence with professional end users on and off the job site, we have added nearly 600 trade specialists and field resources to our team over the last 2 years. And these investments typically show a payback within 12 months of each hire. Our trade specialists visit job sites with DEWALT solutions, demonstrating and promoting our newest innovations. They also gather valuable end user insights to drive future product development priorities.\nIn addition, as part of our Grow the Trades program, we are investing to support the training of new tradespeople and upskilling of established professionals. These initiatives are driving continued organic growth for DEWALT. Our results are informing and guiding future investments in real time and ensure our resources are deployed to the best prospects for accelerated growth.\nIn addition, these initiatives are building DEWALT brand ambassadorship along the way. We rigorously track metrics, from commercial activation to operational execution, with all efforts laddering up to our strategic vision. As a result of these efforts, positive momentum is also beginning to emerge from the international STANLEY brand vitalization effort. In parallel, the CRAFTSMAN brand campaign and portfolio expansion is progressing with an improved margin profile and strategy to drive success with the ambitious DIY enthusiasts.\nOur next imperative is driving operational excellence. While it all starts with activating our brands with purpose, equally vital to our success is our commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement. As we move beyond the transformation, we are executing with a lean-based operating system to deliver annual productivity gains, which we expect will contribute to both margin expansion and firepower for accelerated growth investments.\nOperational excellence also extends to our distribution network. Business process improvements, along with our redesigned distribution network, have helped our team to deliver the best global customer service levels in our company's recent history. As we build strategic partnerships and multiyear growth plans with our channel partners, this will continue to be a top priority.\nAnd finally is innovation, the lifeblood of Stanley Black & Decker's value proposition to our end users. We are accelerating innovation to advance and expand our end-to-end workflow solutions across DEWALT, STANLEY and CRAFTSMAN. By innovating faster, we will strengthen our position to provide preferred solutions for our end users and drive growth for our channel partners and for our brands.\nWe know that our end users, particularly the professional trades, are seeking holistic solutions that make them more productive and safer in every task that they perform on the job site. Providing this comprehensive set of solutions tailored for the specific needs of each trade, all powered by our robust and well-established battery platforms is our opportunity. To enable this, we've centralized our engineering organization under one leader to unify our global strategy with investments in core capabilities, design processes and systems.\nWithin this operating model, we are accelerating how we deploy the product platforming method, which is a comprehensive approach to modular design and governance. It empowers our engineers to dedicate more of their time and expertise towards addressing our end users most pressing and complex challenges. It also enables us to deliver highly specialized solutions to the market at greater speed. Year-to-date, our team has achieved 20% faster product development, and we believe there is runway for an additional 20% improvement by 2027.\nIn addition, this approach is streamlining product development and production processes. This allows us to take full advantage of our scale to achieve cost leadership and drive further working capital efficiencies. Our aim is to implement platforming across roughly 2/3 of our product portfolio by 2027, enabling our 35% plus margin objective. Our entire organization is contributing to an organic growth-oriented culture, underpinned by operational excellence. We believe that by executing this strategy, we can deliver a compelling value creation opportunity.\nA year ago, we outlined long-term financial targets. And those levels of market-beating growth, earnings power, profitability and cash generation remain the appropriate long-term financial targets for our business. We expect our capital deployment priorities to focus on funding investment in the business, improving our balance sheet and supporting our long-standing dividend. Once these priorities have been satisfied and our leverage is sustained below 2.5x, our preference for excess capital will be opportunistic share repurchases.\nWe are executing with purpose, leveraging our core strengths and deploying capital with discipline. While we continue to navigate a dynamic macro today, we believe we are taking the actions required to serve our end users and customers, protect the profitability of the business and make progress toward our long-term financial goals. By fully executing against the strategic imperatives that I outlined, we are confident in achieving strong long-term shareholder returns.\nNow turning to our third quarter 2025 performance. Our operational agility helped us deliver sales and adjusted EBITDA in line with our expectations. Furthermore, gross margin increased year-over-year, restoring progress towards our expansion trajectory and overcoming the tariff-driven interruption experienced during the second quarter. We accomplished these results despite the persistently challenging macroeconomic environment.\nTotal revenue was $3.8 billion, flat with the prior year period and down 1 point organically, driven by pricing up 5% and volume down 6%. We continue to generate growth in our DEWALT brand in the third quarter, supported by relatively resilient professional demand. Consistent with prior quarters, the overall consumer backdrop remains soft.\nOur third quarter adjusted gross margin rate was 31.6%, up 110 basis points versus last year, predominantly driven by the benefits of our pricing strategies and the supply chain transformation efficiencies. This result is a testament to the dedication and collective focus of our teams around the company. It is even more noteworthy given it was achieved in a dynamic macroeconomic environment and with the ongoing production transitions. We expect to continue our trajectory of year-over-year adjusted gross margin improvement with expansion projected on a full year basis for 2025 and 2026.\nThird quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3%, reflecting a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year, mainly attributed to the gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.43, which includes a $0.25 tax benefit that we had previously expected to land in the fourth quarter. Third quarter free cash flow was $155 million, a solid result as we effectively manage working capital while shifting an increasing percentage of our U.S. supply chain to North America.\nTurning to our operating performance by segment. I'll start with Tools & Outdoor. Third quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, which was flat year-over-year. As with the total company revenue drivers, the drivers for Tools & Outdoor were in line with our expectations. Organic revenue declined by 2%, as a 5% benefit from targeted pricing actions was more than offset by a 7% decrease in volume.\nCurrency tailwinds and a small product line transfer from Engineered Fastening each contributed a 1% benefit in the quarter. The volume decrease was partially due to expected price elasticities and partially impacted by tariff-related promotional reductions within the retail channel.\nAs we had indicated during our second quarter earnings call, price realization in the third quarter was consistent with our expectations based on the April price increase. Consistent with prior disclosure, we are implementing a second price increase during the fourth quarter to maintain our innovation and brand investments, given the pressures resulting from tariff-related cost increases.\nDEWALT, our powerhouse professional brand, maintained strong momentum and continued to demonstrate top line growth. The brand delivered revenue expansion across all product lines and regions. This result reflects the positive impact of our ongoing targeted investments in innovation and market activation.\nTools & Outdoor adjusted segment margin was 12%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Margin expansion was driven by price realization and supply chain transformation efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of tariffs, lower volume and inflation.\nShifting to performance by product line. Power tools organic revenue declined 2%, largely resulting from tariff-related promotional cancellations in North America and continued softness in consumer demand. Hand tools organic revenue was flat. Strength within the commercial and industrial channels was offset by softer retail channel performance. Outdoor organic revenue decreased 3% as we ended a subdued outdoor season, where the independent dealer channel partners focused on selling through their remaining inventory. We anticipate inventory will be rightsized heading into preseason ordering for 2026.\nNow Tools & Outdoor performance by region. In North America, organic revenue declined 2%, reflecting trends consistent with the overall segment performance. End user demand, as measured by U.S. retail tools and outdoor POS, started the quarter strong, but moderated later in the quarter, with aggregate third quarter performance at a level that was relatively flat on a dollar basis. In Europe, organic revenue was flat. Growth in the U.K. and key investment markets, including Central and Eastern Europe, was offset by softer market conditions in France and Germany. The Rest of World organic revenue declined 1%, primarily due to pockets of market softness in Asia.\nTurning to Engineered Fastening. Third quarter revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 5% organically as compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was comprised of a 4% volume increase, a 1% price benefit and a 1% contribution from currency. This was partially offset by a 3% headwind from the previously disclosed product line transfer to the Tools & Outdoor segment.\nThe aerospace business continued its strong trajectory, achieving over 25% organic growth, propelled by robust demand for fasteners and fittings. This business maintained its exceptional year-over-year and sequential top line growth supported by a solid backlog. The automotive business delivered low single-digit organic growth, reflecting a stronger-than-anticipated automotive market during the quarter. General industrial fasteners organic revenue declined by mid-single digits.\nAdjusted segment margin for Engineered Fastening was 12.8%, which reflects elevated production costs in relation to a tough prior year comparable. On a sequential basis, adjusted segment margin expanded by 200 basis points versus the second quarter, reflecting improvements in the automotive market.\nOverall, our teams delivered results in line with expectations through disciplined execution, targeted pricing strategies and a continued optimization of our supply chain, a solid quarter in a trying environment with significant credit to the global Stanley Black & Decker team. Together, we all continue to make meaningful progress on what is within our control. Thank you to our team around the world for all your hard work and the dedication you display every day to our customers and end users.\nI will now pass the call to Pat to discuss progress we achieved on key performance metrics and to outline our latest 2025 planning assumptions.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone joining us today. I'm going to start by diving deeper into our gross margin performance.\nIn the third quarter, the company achieved adjusted gross margin of 31.6%, representing a 110 basis point increase over the same period last year. Our entire organization has prioritized margin expansion. And through the implementation of targeted initiatives, we have achieved tangible year-over-year margin improvement. The improvements have been primarily driven by our disciplined pricing strategies and enhanced supply chain efficiencies. Our targeted initiatives contributed meaningfully to our performance this quarter, though the benefits were partially offset by tariffs, reduced volume and inflation.\nOur gross margin trajectory remains firmly positive, reflecting the organization's steadfast dedication to operational excellence. The team's commitment and capability to deliver is exemplified by the fact that even with the significant tariff expenses hitting our P&L starting in April, we only had a single quarter of gross margin setback. Despite broader market volatility, our teams have demonstrated remarkable agility and focus, ensuring we sustain profitable growth even in uncertain environments.\nAnd looking forward to 2026, we foresee a strong opportunity for significant year-over-year adjusted gross margin expansion versus 2025, even if the macro conditions do not improve materially. We continue to target 35-plus percent adjusted gross margin. As a team, we continue to strive to achieve or be very close to this target by the fourth quarter of 2026.\nTurning now to our global cost reduction transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to make substantial progress, delivering approximately $120 million in incremental pretax run rate cost savings. These actions are instrumental in supporting our ongoing margin improvement trajectory, which ultimately enables sustained investment in growth.\nSince its inception in mid-2022, the program has generated about $1.9 billion in pretax run rate cost savings, underscoring the scale and effectiveness of our transformation agenda. We are on track to meet our targets, with consistent progress across all work streams. We expect the transformation program to yield cost savings of $500 million in 2025 and $2 billion overall by the end of this year, marking the successful achievement of this initiative's original cost reduction goals.\nA key element of our tariff mitigation and gross margin improvement strategy centers on minimizing the amount of U.S. supply that comes from China. We are making substantial advancements in this area and systematically progressing along a clearly defined path. We have been rapidly moving cordless production from China to Mexico, while also rapidly increasing the levels of USMCA compliant production in Mexico. We expect to continue to meet targeted reductions in U.S. goods from China. We plan to reduce from 2024 levels when approximately 15% of our U.S. supply was sourced from China, to less than 10% by the middle of 2026, and to less than 5% by the end of 2026. These milestones are essential for achieving targeted gross margin objectives and for improving supply chain resiliency. By diversifying our supply chain, we are better positioning our business to navigate evolving trade dynamics, respond to regulatory changes and deliver operational excellence.\nOperational excellence via platforming, lean manufacturing and further fixed cost reductions will remain a top priority beyond 2025. We remain confident in our ability to sustain positive momentum as we move into 2026, and that our focus on disciplined execution will deliver sustainable productivity gains and cost leadership. Annual productivity improvements will serve as the engine to fund investments that drive top line growth and further our competitive position. The actions we are taking today are foundational to supporting ongoing margin improvement and achieving our long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35-plus percent.\nNow let's take a look at our planning assumption for 2025. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $4.55, a reduction of $0.10 compared to the estimate from last quarter. This revision reflects higher-than-anticipated production costs resulting from tariff-related volume softness and supply chain changes. We will correct for these items during the fourth quarter to facilitate achievement of targeted 2026 gross margin improvement, making these headwinds temporary elements of our tariff mitigation response plan. Our earnings outlook for the year reflects an updated GAAP earnings per share range of $2.55 to $2.70. This revision from the previous planning assumption is primarily attributable to $169 million pretax noncash asset impairment charge recorded in the third quarter.\nLet me provide clarity on these impairment charges. First, updates to our brand prioritization strategy to focus more company resources and investment on DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY, which we have discussed many times over the past year, impacted 3 trade names specifically LENOX, Troy-Bilt and IRWIN. This was the vast majority of the impairment charges. Going forward, we intend to focus on marketing of these specialty brands to specific product categories and regions where they hold their most meaningful market positions and value to end users.\nSecond, we've made a strategic decision to exit most of our noncore legacy corporate venture investments, which resulted in the write-down of certain minority investments in the quarter. Total pretax non-GAAP adjustments for the year are estimated to range between $370 million to $400 million, primarily related to the supply chain transformation, noncash asset impairment charges and other cost actions that will benefit SG&A. We expect approximately 45% of these adjustments to be noncash as they pertain to the aforementioned trade name impairment charges and write-down of certain minority investments associated with legacy corporate ventures.\nNow in regards to the revenue outlook. For the full year, we anticipate total company sales to be flat to down 1% as compared to 2024, most likely at the lower end of this range. Organic revenue is projected to decline in the same zone as a total company, and price realization is expected to be offset by anticipated volume declines. Currency is expected to contribute a positive 1 percentage point, which will be offset by the first quarter comparable impact from the infrastructure divestiture. We expect adjusted gross margins to remain resilient. And based on our current trajectory, we expect to be approaching 31% adjusted gross margin for the full year 2025. To deliver profit and cash in a dynamic environment, we will continue to advance our tariff mitigation and gross margin expansion journeys, and we will manage SG&A thoughtfully relative to expected volumes while preserving growth investments.\nLooking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect continued year-over-year expansion of adjusted gross margin to around 33%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This outlook is supported by our second round of price increases, ongoing benefits from our supply chain transformation and additional tariff mitigation measures, partially pressured by tariff-related production costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales for both the year and the fourth quarter is planned to be 21% in a fraction, characterized by judicious cost management while protecting strategic growth investments. We remain committed to investing in high-growth, high-return opportunities, with over $100 million being reinvested in 2025 to drive market activation, strengthen our brands and support commercial expansion, while managing SG&A costs down elsewhere in the business.\nFor the full year and fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are also expected to expand year-over-year, supported by gross margin improvements and the cost actions we are implementing.\nShifting to our segments. For the Tools & Outdoor segment, the full year organic revenue outlook is projected to decline approximately 1 percentage point. The Engineered Fastening segment is expected to achieve low single-digit organic revenue growth led by aerospace.\nNow turning to cash generation. We generated $155 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, making progress toward our full year 2025 free cash flow objective of $600 million, which remains unchanged from a quarter ago. As we advance through the last quarter of 2025 and into 2026, we remain committed to diligent inventory management, ensuring customer order fulfillment remains a top priority, even as we proactively navigate evolving supply chain dynamics and potential shifts in the external market environment. Our capital expenditure outlook for 2025 remains approximately $300 million, in line with previous planning assumptions.\nOn capital allocation, we intend to allocate free cash flow in excess of our dividend toward debt reduction in the near term. Maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet is a top priority, and we are committed to achieving a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 2.5x. Our strategy to reach this leverage objective is to be supported by the proceeds from an asset sale we are targeting within the next 12 months. We continue to anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be approximately 15% for the year.\nOther modeling assumptions for 2025, as shown here, are generally consistent with the assumption shared with you in July. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate organic revenue to be flat as price increases are offset by volume pressures, stemming from a subdued consumer DIY market. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued pretax earnings growth and working capital efficiencies driven by the seasonal drawdown of receivables and a modest decrease in inventory to deliver our free cash flow target. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $1.29.\nWe remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our industry and our business. The targets we laid out for you a year ago at our Capital Markets Day remain appropriate for the business and our focus, albeit delayed by roughly a year due to the impact of increased tariffs. Near term, we expect market conditions to remain dynamic and challenging. We will continue to respond decisively through targeted supply chain and SG&A adjustments, underscoring our commitment to meet the needs of our end users and customers while delivering financial result improvement. We continue to focus on enhancing the company's long-term earnings power and strengthening the balance sheet.\nThank you. And I will now turn the call back to Chris.\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat. We are strengthening our operational resilience on a daily basis. Our disciplined data-driven approach empowers us to navigate evolving market conditions, seize emerging opportunities and consistently deliver value to our stakeholders.\nAs Pat outlined, we are continuing to proactively manage factors within our control to facilitate the achievement and advancement of our goals. We believe our outlook for 2025 is balanced given the elevated levels of global uncertainty. We recognize the operating environment is challenging. And we are focused on creating significant value from our powerful brands and businesses to generate long-term revenue growth, margin expansion, cash generation and shareholder return.\nWe remain committed to driving towards the goals outlined during our November 2024 Capital Markets Day. I am confident that with the collective dedication of our talented team, and an unwavering commitment to supporting our customers and end users, Stanley Black & Decker will continue to set new standards for excellence in the years to come.\nWe are now ready for Q&A, Michael.\n\nMichael J. Wherley\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nThank you, Chris. Shannon, you can begin the Q&A now."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 Second Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.\nOur earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent '34 Act filing.\nAdditionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's release, we extended our trajectory of solid execution on our operational priorities, which drove gross margin improvement versus the prior year and very strong cash generation in the second quarter. It is also extremely satisfying to report that we delivered organic growth this quarter. As you are aware, there was a significant demand normalization post pandemic that required a recalibration of inventory for us and our customers. We believe that we have stabilized our share position in the marketplace. In this quarter, we capitalized on the strength of the DEWALT brand and supportive pockets of end market demand to deliver positive organic revenue growth in the period.\nOur priorities remain consistent at this stage of our transformation. And this morning, you will hear tangible progress in each of these key areas of focus. First, we continue to drive profitability improvement through the significant transformation of our supply chain to achieve our target of 35% plus gross margins. Next, we experienced strong free cash flow generation and significant balance sheet strength improvement. And finally, new investments to stimulate sustainable growth are increasing with the primary aim of reinvigorating share gain to achieve organic growth at 2 to 3x the market.\nWe continue to be energized by the compelling long-term growth opportunities in our industry and believe in our ability to capture their value, yet we remain clear eyed about the near-term environment and expect mixed demand trends to continue in 2024 across our markets.\nAs we capture the savings from the cost structure improvements, which are broadly in our control, we will be measured and disciplined as we selectively invest in the parts of our business that offer the best projects for growth. We are focused on how we outperformed the market to gain share and are pleased by the green shoots emerging in various channels.\nSo while our markets will be choppy for the short term, we are building the processes and structure to create a sustainable growth operating model, which will ensure we significantly benefit from the long-term growth opportunities in the industries we serve.\nI have asked Chris to describe how we are both thoughtfully and aggressively pursuing our growth agenda in Tools & Outdoor, which he will discuss in further detail this morning.\nOur global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. Our teams continue to accelerate savings actions, which has successfully delivered $1.3 billion of run rate savings program -- These results reinforce our confidence in achieving our 35% plus adjusted gross margin goal.\nI am confident that by executing on our transformation strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, which will drive strong long-term shareholder returns.\nNow turning to second quarter results. We delivered $4 billion of revenue, down 3% versus the prior year. This includes 1% of organic growth, which was led by DEWALT, the outdoor product categories and Engineered Fastening. This was more than offset by a 3% drag from the infrastructure divestiture and 1% of currency. Adjusted gross margin was 29.2%, up 560 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. Our supply chain transformation was a major contributor to this improvement. It has strong momentum that we expect to carry through the back half and into 2025.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin returned to double digits and were 10.7%, which is a 5-point improvement versus prior year. This was driven by our gross margin expansion, offset by deliberate increases in growth investments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 versus second quarter.\nFree cash flow in the quarter approached $0.5 billion, primarily due to accelerated working capital improvements. The strong cash generation, along with proceeds from the infrastructure divestiture, contributed $1.2 billion of debt reduction in the quarter. We continue to prioritize improving balance sheet health. And in a few moments, Pat will address our plans for more progress over the next 18 months.\nAs we delever, we are also maintaining our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. And to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend, which is now $0.82 per share. Finally, we are raising our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.10 at the midpoint to a range of $3.70 up to $4.50 and increasing our free cash flow guidance to $650 million up to $850 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation.\nI want to thank our team members for their collaboration and focus as we continue to make substantial progress on our transformation plan and achieve our interim financial goals we established about 2 years ago.\nI will now pass to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance. Chris?\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor. Second quarter revenue was approximately $3.5 billion with 1% organic growth versus prior year. DEWALT delivered another strong quarter, generating its fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth. DEWALT's performance, combined with a stronger outdoor season drove 2% volume growth. We are particularly encouraged by this result given the soft consumer backdrop. .\nTotal revenue was flat as volume benefits were offset by 1% of currency in addition to 1% of price, which was consistent with our plan to support DEWALT cordless promotions. We are now back in line with historical levels of seasonal promotions. Second quarter adjusted segment margin was 10.4%, a 590 basis point improvement compared to last year. We delivered year-over-year margin expansion through lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset by targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain in organic growth.\nTurning to the product lines for the second quarter. Power tools declined 2% organically, driven by the consumer DIY category. Hand tools organic revenue was flat with new DEWALT product introductions driving increased product listings with our customers. Outdoor organic revenue grew 6% with strong retail volume growth driven by handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings.\nTurning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America generated 1% organic growth, driven by the same factors as the overall segment. Second quarter U.S. retail point-of-sale demand was up modestly versus the prior year, led by outdoor and regain DEWALT cordless promotions. In Europe, organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Italy were partially offset by growth in the U.K., the Nordics and Iberia. We are prioritizing investments in new product listings to grow market share and overcome the macro softness that is affecting this region's economy.\nTo round out geographic performance for the quarter, all other regions in aggregate grew 5% organically. This was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with high single-digit growth in India.\nIn summary, for Tools & Outdoor, the quarter was highlighted by a return to organic growth with a meaningful step-up to segment margin.\nNow moving to Industrial. Second quarter Industrial revenue declined 20% versus last year, which was nearly all due to the infrastructure divestiture. Price contributed positive 2% to growth, offset by a 2% currency headwind. The Engineered Fastening business grew 2% organically, driven by aerospace growth, which more than offset the market softness in automotive and customer destocking in general industrial. The aerospace business grew 24% organically, supported by new business wins and a strong booking rate.\nThe Industrial adjusted segment margin was 13.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost control.\nI'd like to thank our teams around the world for their dedication to delivering another solid performance in the second quarter. Their focused efforts delivered organic growth and margin expansion across both business segments.\nMoving to the next slide. As I reflect on my first year here at Stanley Black & Decker, much of my time and energy has been directed towards learning about our end users and channel partners' priorities and how to both efficiently and effectively accelerate the next phase of Tools & Outdoor organic growth and market share gains. It's clear to me that we have four essential attributes for success.\nOne, an industry with long-term growth characteristics; two, iconic brands; three, a differentiated innovation engine; and four, deep customer relationships and loyal end users. I have strong conviction that we can create long-term value by capturing the commercial opportunities ahead of us, both now and into the future.\nTo -- these opportunities, we are funding investments both by redirecting existing resources towards the most promising opportunities as well as investing incremental dollars consistent with the $300 million to $500 million range that Don and Pat have referenced on previous occasions.\nAlong with market-facing priorities, I've also been focused on our team putting in place the right capabilities and skills to execute our strategy. I am pleased to have my new organization established with a leadership team consisting of seasoned Stanley Black & Decker veterans complemented by external talent who bring fresh perspectives. They are all in place in driving forward momentum.\nThe valuable breadth and depth of knowledge across the leadership team and organization is allowing us to activate our strategy with urgency. We are prioritizing our resources on the highest impact opportunities which we believe are serving the professional end user within our most attractive market.\nOver the past 12 months, as we continue to streamline and focus our business, we've doubled down on being brand-led and are prioritizing DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY. These powerful brands have significant scale in the marketplace and strong brand equity with end users. By continuing to strengthen these brands and maximizing brand health, we can capitalize on their potential for long-term growth share gain and margin improvement.\nTurning to innovation. We view our long-standing ability to listen to end users and to deliver purpose-built innovation as a core differentiating capability. We are laser-focused on driving innovation to help solve the most pressing challenges our professional end users face, namely finding ways to improve their safety and productivity on the job site while ensuring they have robust tools to help deliver the high-quality craftmanship their customers expect.\nOur core brands have been synonymous with delivering this type of value to job sites for many years, and we will continue to push the boundaries of these solutions as enhancing safety and productivity on the job site has never been more relevant to the professional end user. For example, we announced the next evolution in battery technology this quarter, the DEWALT XR Powerpack 8 amp hour battery with [ table cell ] technology. This joins the reinvigorated XR line, which houses the best-performing 20-volt MAX batteries and power tools from DEWALT. This battery technology conducts more energy, delivers more power output and has a longer lifespan, which enhances end-user productivity.\nWe also introduced the DEWALT ToughSeries Construction Jack, a tool designed to increase productivity by giving [ warmth ], the confidence and security to lift, level and hold material without assistance. With up to 340 pounds of lift capacity and fine-tuning adjustment features, this tool is a must-have for any end user.\nMarket activation is another investment priority and growth opportunity. We are more aggressively activating our core brands amplified digital product marketing and additional field resources, both with the goal of extending the reach and impact of our brands and innovation. We expect our elevated marketing efforts behind DEWALT, coupled with support to grow the trades through grants, scholarships and tool donations will broaden user engagement and brand ambassadorship. These sales and marketing initiatives are funded with new investment dollars and the reallocation of resources, which illustrates our prioritization efforts towards our best prospects for growth.\nIn addition to delivering cost savings and driving margin improvement, which you have heard from Don, our supply chain transformation is also an enabler of growth, enhancing operational efficiency and achieving 35% plus adjusted gross margin unlocks incremental optionality to invest even more behind our brands and to accelerate the virtuous cycle of organic growth.\nWe believe that our emphasis on operational excellence in combination with the structural changes we are making to our production and distribution network which are the crux of our supply chain transformation can become a sustainable growth enabler for the company as we serve our customers and end users with excellence and speed. In addition, continuous improvement capabilities we are strengthening as a part of this transformation will serve as a sustainable engine to help generate recurring productivity to self-fund the business and our brands.\nIn summary, while the near-term market demand environment remains mixed, we are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities in our industry. We are aggressively moving forward to accelerate the growth of our powerful brands with our end users and customers around the globe. We have a talented team deployed that is moving with speed and a clear mandate, executing our transformation plan and accelerating share gain. This simple but powerful mandate energizes our team as we work to position ourselves to win in the marketplace.\nThank you, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. We're 2 years into our transformation journey and are continuing to make meaningful progress each quarter. I would like to highlight our accomplishments during the second quarter and how we intend to meet our objectives with continued focus and intensity during the back half of 2024 and beyond.\nWe achieved approximately $150 million of pretax run rate cost savings in the quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.3 billion since program inception. Our performance represents strong execution. On a year-to-date basis, we are tracking to plan, driven by strategic sourcing actions. We are diligently capturing cost efficiencies to counter the soft demand backdrop. I am pleased to say the savings we generated in the first half support the second half gross margin expansion included in our guidance. More on that later.\nWe continue to target $1.5 billion of pretax run rate savings by the year-end of 2024 and $2 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2025. We are on track to [ achieve ] both targets. As a reminder, the biggest areas where we see savings opportunities are strategic sourcing, operations excellence, footprint actions and complexity reduction.\nStrategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are actioning $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures. Operations excellence is the next area of opportunity. Our initiatives are driving productivity improvements that translate into tangible results. This initiative encompasses our manufacturing operating model and leverages lean principles. In 2024, this has been particularly effective in reducing downtime and improving labor efficiency. We have a robust pipeline of projects lined up to deliver savings this year and beyond.\nTurning to footprint-related projects and product platforming. We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage scale and centers of excellence as we maximize operational efficiency. This multiyear endeavor continues to progress as planned, and we expect to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe over the next 18 months.\nWe are well underway with our platforming strategy, which identifies methods to standardize parts and components across product families to eliminate complexity and to improve procurement scale. We are incorporating this strategy into our product development process across power tools and outdoor products with significant opportunities across DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and zero-turn mowers. This exciting program is in the early innings, and we believe it can be a source of material productivity well beyond 2025.\nIn aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, achieve a full year gross margin of 30% and fund additional growth investments in our core business.\nI would like to commend the organization for diligently pursuing the goals of our transformation. This journey would not be possible without everyone's contributions. We are developing the sustainable cost structure and operational efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments.\nMoving to the next. Two main areas of focus this year are generating free cash flow and expanding gross margins to support long-term growth and value creation. We generated a historically strong $486 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2024. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to approximately neutral. Our performance was supported by approximately $400 million of accelerated working capital improvements, which were realized earlier in 2024 versus our initial plan. We continued to make progress on our inventory levels and sequentially reduced our inventory balance by approximately $100 million this quarter. Inventory days remained below 150 and are moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days.\nThe remainder of the working capital favorability was a result of improved accounts receivable and accounts payable balances versus our plan. Our strong free cash flow, along with the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale enabled $1.2 billion of commercial paper reduction during the second quarter. The strong momentum in the first half and a modest reduction to our capital spending expectations gives us the confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance range to $650 million to $850 million, up from our prior range of $600 million to $800 million. We expect second half free cash flow in excess of the dividend to support an additional $400 million to $500 million of short-term debt reduction by year-end, which will result in a total debt balance that is a little over $6 billion.\nIn 2025, we are targeting further deleveraging through free cash flow generation, coupled with the funds generated by strategic portfolio pruning actions. Our goal for the year-end 2025 is total debt in the low $5 billion zone, inclusive of inorganic cash generation. This plan enables us to achieve our desired leverage metrics and is consistent with the discussions with our rating agencies.\nAnother item of note, this past quarter, we proactively renegotiated the company's core credit facilities, securing access to significant liquidity to support the company's ongoing transformation. We prioritize maintaining investment-grade credit ratings and have access to $3.5 billion in credit facilities backed by a long-standing, well-capitalized and diversified bank group. Our capital allocation priorities remain investing in our organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing cash dividend to return value to shareholders and further strengthening our balance sheet.\nTurning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 29.2% in the second quarter, a 560 basis point improvement versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. In the first half of 2024, we improved adjusted gross margin by 40 basis points sequentially versus second half 2023 consistent with our plan. We are planning for further sequential improvement in the second half of this year with adjusted gross margin expected to approximate 31%. Our second half step-up is supported by our supply chain transformation savings, which are and have been tracking to plan. This plan puts us on a path to deliver our long-held transformation goal of approximately 30% full year 2024 adjusted gross margin and exit the year in the low 30s.\nWe continue to be on a solid trajectory of adjusted gross margin improvement against a challenging macro backdrop. Our momentum gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our gross margin objectives for 2024 and achieve 35% plus adjusted gross margin within the transformation time horizon.\nNow turning to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the updated free cash flow guidance I just shared, we are revising GAAP earnings per share range to $0.90 to $2 and raising adjusted earnings per share range to $3.70 to $4.50. The GAAP earnings per share revision is primarily a result of incorporating the second quarter environmental reserve expense of approximately $155 million into the range. Adjusted earnings per share is being revised $0.10 higher at the midpoint. Our outlook factors in a soft macro environment in the second half. We are leveraging the cost savings within our control to offset this and generate second half adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year.\nThe EPS improvement at the midpoint passes along a portion of the second quarter operating outperformance and includes lower back half interest expense due to accelerated deleveraging. Our midpoint assumption for full year organic revenue is expected to be down 0.5 percentage point. This contemplates the continuation of the stretched consumer in Tools & Outdoor along with a declining automotive production backdrop -- Industrial. Our sales contemplates plus or minus 130 basis points, which is the primary area of adjusted earnings per share variability.\nTurning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor full year organic revenue is expected to decline 1% at the midpoint plus or minus low single digits, with a range of variability similar to the total company. Pricing for Tools & Outdoor is expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is consistent with what we are seeing in the market today.\nThe Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive as aero fasteners growth is partially pressured by global automotive OEM light vehicle production headwind. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding and reprioritizing investments for long-term organic growth.\nOur planning assumption for innovation, brand marketing activation and technology growth investments remains an incremental $100 million in 2024. Our expectation for full year SG&A as a percentage of sales is to be in the mid-21% zone.\nTurning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by savings from the transformation program. Adjusted segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial adjusted segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus the prior year as operating improvements and cost controls and engineered fastening are offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture. Our adjusted earnings per share range is $0.80 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor.\nWe will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for long-term growth.\nTurning to other elements of our guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $445 million to $495 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program as well as the second quarter environmental expense. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for the full year with the third quarter approximating 20% and a benefit in the fourth quarter. Our 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year at the midpoint.\nIn summary, looking forward, we remain focused on executing our supply chain improvements to further improve gross margin and earnings in the second half of 2024 and our progress to date supports our improved full year adjusted earnings and free cash flow outlook. We remain confident that our actions to drive toward our target of 35-plus percent adjusted gross margin, while funding additional organic revenue growth investments will continue to generate positive results. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, generating cash and further strengthening the balance sheet to position the company for long-term growth and value creation.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is making meaningful progress across our key priority of margin improvement, cash generation and balance sheet health, while also investing in future sustainable growth. We are moving with speed and delivering results in a macro environment that has not been supportive, but we are confident that it will turn from a headwind to a tailwind in the future.\nUntil then, we are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, improve profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns.\nWe are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. ."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 First Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.\nOur earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just 1 question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views.\nSuch statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution, and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy.\nWe are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin.\nThis is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24, versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.\nOur global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and -- and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey, our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results.\nSpecifically, we have captured $1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024, consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations.\nWe believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months. As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20%, which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business.\nWe are actioning significant cost efficiencies and -- to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as wide-body plane production continues to recover.\nOur long-term success will be driven by improved profitability, coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example, our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers, which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.\nWe are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates, earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023, ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award.\nCongratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners, it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance, we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.\nTurning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business, organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand.\nAdjusted gross margin was 29%, and up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs.\nWe are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50, up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation.\nOn April 1, we completed the sale of Stanley Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt, demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet.\nLooking forward in 2024, we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses. and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins, deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow.\nAt the same time, we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses.\nI want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.\nI will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, First quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, down 1% organically versus prior year. as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand, which pressured volume.\nPricing was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter, a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions, which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain in organic growth.\nNow turning to the product lines. Power Tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high-margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand.\nOutdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data, which showed an early start to the season versus prior year.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last 2 years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays.\nThe independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory, which pressured shipments in the quarter. We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025.\nAs Don alluded earlier, the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure.\nConsistent with our overall strategy, our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment.\nTurning to Tools and Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically, driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe, organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the U.K.\nWe are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share.\nIn aggregate, all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter.\nIn summary, for Tools and Outdoor, we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro, while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength.\nWe are making deliberate investments in our brands, market activation, and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to long-term shareholder returns.\nI will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and 1 point of currency pressure.\nWithin the Industrial segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. And -- we believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains, particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening.\nIndustrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1%, an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity. This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced.\nThe quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year.\nNow turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions, which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode, ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.\nDEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site.\nAdditionally, our ToughSystem 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites.\nThese are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.\nWe believe these innovations, coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains.\nAs we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary, we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley.\nThank you, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately $145 million pretax run rate cost savings in the period, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.2 billion since program inception.\nAs we focus our portfolio, streamline our business structure and transform our operations, our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure.\nGiven the dynamic macro environment, we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pretax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.\nStrategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures.\nOur operations excellence program, which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities.\nA pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming, which are more event-driven, will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.\nWe are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025.\nAnd -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production, and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter, which affected 5 sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year.\nRegarding product platforming, this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family, which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.\nIn aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business.\nWe remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments.\nMoving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases.\nThis quarter, our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately $360 million, where we've traditionally averaged a roughly $700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.\nDays of inventory is now approximately 150 days, an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days.\nWe used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close, it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet.\nWe remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. We -- For the full year 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency.\nCapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives. These items, combined with organic cash generation, support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million, which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year.\nOur capital deployment priorities remain consistent, investing in organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet.\nTurning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs.\nWe expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024, and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year. We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s.\nWe are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth.\nNow turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered, we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50.\nA -- we are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level, we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.\nOur view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets, and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth.\nTurning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits, most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive.\nInfrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed, we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly.\nOur planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024. These are designed to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley brands.\nThis should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor.\nTurning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation.\nThe Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.\nWe -- our adjusted EPS range remains $1, with variability in market demand being the largest contributor, we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth.\nTurning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely relating to the supply chain transformation program. with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs.\nOur adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024, with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. And -- Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.\nOther 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25%, with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile.\nIn summary, we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion, cash generation, balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market.\nWe are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team.\nAs our profitability continues to improve, we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands. particularly DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley.\nWe believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2 to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business, built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening.\nWe are focused on consistent execution, while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. .\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you."

Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 Quarter and Full Year Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, CEO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website.

Stanley Black & Decker's performance in 2023 reflects our relentless focus on the execution of our strategic business transformation which resulted in us building a strong foundation for improved profitability in 2024. Stanley Black & Decker today is a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified focus on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and industrial. Despite a challenging market backdrop that pressured volumes during the year, adjusted gross margin improved in each quarter and we generated over $850 million of free cash flow. These results demonstrate significant progress against 2 of our most important areas of focus during 2023.\nHere are just a few additional examples of our accomplishments from the past year. We improved the health of our cost structure as a result of the momentum from our supply chain transformation. We achieved our 2023 target and delivered over $1 billion of savings programmed to date. We remain on track for the expected $2 billion of savings targeted by the end of 2025. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin approached 30%. This result outperformed the plan as our team's accelerated efforts to deliver profit and cash in response to the soft volume environment. Our strong free cash flow generation was primarily the result of $1.1 billion of inventory reduction as we successfully executed our supply chain initiatives. We continue to actively manage our portfolio of businesses. In December, we announced the agreement to sell our infrastructure business and currently expect that transaction to close at the end of the first quarter. This aligns with our simplification efforts and focus on shareholder value creation while advancing our capital allocation priorities. We strengthened our leadership team with the addition of 3 new highly capable seasoned and respected leaders and Chris Nelson, Pat Hallinan and John Lucas, each of whom brings a fresh and exciting set of perspectives.\nStepping back over the past 1.5 years, we have transformed Stanley Black & Decker into a different company, refocused and reenergized. Together, our talented and motivated leadership team, along with our diverse and high-performing associates across the globe are executing our transformation strategy with urgency and diligence to ensure we continue to achieve our goals. Our performance to date is encouraging and reinforces our confidence in making investments to pursue the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets that we serve.\nShifting now to our fourth quarter performance. Revenue was $3.7 billion, which was down mid-single digits versus the prior year, primarily due to lower outdoor and DIY volume as well as infrastructure customer destocking. Our profitability exceeded our plan as we recorded adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up over 10 points versus the prior year and improved 220 basis points versus the third quarter. As a result of our focused efforts, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential adjusted gross margin improvement. We also reduced inventory by $240 million this quarter, which brings our total inventory reduction to $1.9 billion since mid-2022 when we began this journey.\n2024 will be the next chapter of transformation, an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to further improve profitability and cash flow as we plant the seeds for future growth and success for Stanley Black & Decker. While it will be a transitional year, we are continuing to strengthen our foundation to create greater future earnings power. We will remain focused on delivering differentiated product innovation through our portfolio of world-class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets, all aimed to improve margin, earnings and cash flow.\nTurning to the markets we serve. Our view is that these markets will remain dynamic in 2024. Overall, we expect relative strength and demand from professional tools and portions of our industrial markets. However, we believe the consumer and outdoor demand trends will continue to be weak. Together, this results in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for all of our markets. Our global trade weighted GDP estimates are slightly positive, with U.S. real GDP growth projected to slow but remain positive in 2024. Global commercial construction is expected to moderate and industrial tool markets are expected to remain supportive. The global industrial fastener in categories will be led by aerospace, while automotive and industrial production markets will be relatively flat. There are a few key macroeconomic indicators that more directly impact our larger markets in North America, which are somewhat mixed. Examples of this mixed North American tools and outdoor market are as follows: New residential builds are forecasted to improve from current levels, yet remain modestly negative year-over-year. Residential repair and remodel is currently expected to retract, and the outdoor power equipment industry continues to show signs of customer destocking, and we don't expect to pivot to growth during 2024.\nIn summary, we're focused on the pro user and the healthiest market segments to generate share gains. We are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. The midpoint of our 2024 plan represents a continuation of the current demand environment, which, in aggregate, is slightly negative for all markets. We will remain agile and ready to serve incremental demand if it accelerates in the second half. We believe that with our powerful brand and strong innovation machine, we have the opportunity to capture new wins with our customers and outperform the market. Our plan for the year is underpinned by the continued supply chain cost improvements that are broadly in our control. We expect to deliver gross margin accretion, earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Pat will discuss this in more detail in just a few moments.\n2024 will be a year of focus, excitement and purpose, and it is fitting that we are celebrating the 100-year anniversary of DEWALT, a noteworthy milestone and a reminder that we have been revolutionizing job sites for a century. We will always relentlessly innovate for our pros and all our end users, allowing them to achieve better, safer and faster results. I want to thank our 50,000-plus employees around the world for their persistence and commitment to our mission in 2023. They each have contributed to the progress we've made on our transformation journey.\nNow stepping into the business segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the tools and outdoor results. Fourth quarter industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year. Price realization was more than offset by lower volume which was driven by the continuation of customer destocking and infrastructure. Within the segment, Engineered Fastening fourth quarter organic revenues were up 7%. This includes Aerospace growth of 27% and Auto growth of 10%, as we benefit from recoveries in those markets. This growth was partially muted by market softness in general and [indiscernible]. The fourth quarter Industrial adjusted segment margin was 11.1%, down 40 basis points versus prior year as lower volume more than offset price realization and cost control.\nFor the year, we are very pleased with the performance of our Industrial segment. While organic revenue growth was flat, Engineered Fastening, which is our focus moving forward within this segment was up 6% organically behind the strength in Automotive and Aerospace. The team delivered full year adjusted segment margin of 11.8%, up 210 basis points versus 2022. This expansion was driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity throughout the year. I want to thank the Industrial business team for their strong execution in 2023.\nAnd I'd like to especially thank the Infrastructure team for their valuable contribution to Stanley Black & Decker. I am confident that the business is positioned for a future of innovation and growth with [indiscernible].\nI will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools & Outdoor performance.\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now turning to the Tools & Outdoor fourth quarter operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion, down 8% organically versus prior year as a result of lower volumes, primarily from soft consumer outdoor and DIY market demand, while price remained flat, made substantial progress improving profitability through the year, driving adjusted segment margin to 10% in the fourth quarter. This was a sequential step-up of 70 basis points versus the third quarter and 900 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. We achieved this by realizing lower inventory destocking costs delivering supply chain transformation savings and capturing the benefits of shipping cost deflation, which were partially offset by lower volume.\nNow turning to the product lines. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 6%, while power tools was up 1 point organically as pro-driven momentum offset pressures in DIY demand. Outdoor was significantly challenged as customers rightsize their inventory levels. We expect that trend to continue into the start of the 2024 selling season. In Tools, we finished the year with a relatively stable market backdrop supported by Pro demand. For example, Power Tools organic performance improved each quarter in 2023 and exited in a growth position. This demonstrates the demand for our iconic pro-centric DEWALT brand and the best-in-class products that we are bringing to the market. As the Outdoor market achieves post-COVID normalization, we are focused on improving our cost structure while prioritizing investments to capture targeted share gain opportunities with customers and accelerating innovation in handheld electrification, which is a growing and highly profitable category.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter performance by region. North America was down 10% organically with the tools product lines down low single digits. The commercial and industrial channel which has a heavy professional user base grew low single digits organically. Fourth quarter U.S. retail point-of-sale demand remained negative versus the prior year, but above 2019 levels, supported by price increases and strength in professional tools. European organic revenue was down 1% with outperformance in the Nordics and Italy, which generated double-digit organic growth as we continue to invest in expanding our professional product offerings and activating new battery-powered innovations within the region. Emerging markets grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 1%. Solid emerging market performance was led by high teens organic growth in Brazil marking the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth in the country. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor team for their focused efforts throughout the year, which has positioned us well as we continue to focus on winning with our customers in capturing long-term profitable growth and market share.\nNow turning to the next slide. I would like to now introduce our new groundbreaking equipment system DEWALT POWERSHIFT. We are proud to bring this to market later this year as it demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and electrification for the Pros. The DEWALT POWERSHIFT system was unveiled at the World of Concrete trade show last week and is designed to meet the critical needs of concrete professionals. The electrified line will allow the Pro to transition away from gas-powered equipment without compromising efficiency and performance. Each of the 6 concrete tools in the system uses the DEWALT POWERSHIFT 554-watt hour battery and high-speed charger to streamline efficiency. The battery can deliver up to 5,000 watts of continuous power, that is equivalent to 6.5 horsepower and is designed to withstand the toughest job site conditions. The POWERSHIFT battery leverages pouch cell technology which DEWALT first brought to the industry in October of 2021. POWERSHIFT technology enables the cordless job site in the future, bringing more power, run time and efficiency. Take, for example, the POWERSHIFT vibrator used for concrete placement. It is 85% more efficient than gas vibrators in the market today. POWERSHIFT vibrators deliver 60 continuous minutes of nonstop work, which gives the user about 30% more run time than a tank of gas. There are electrified vibrators in the market today that can only deliver 15 minutes of run time. Adding to the extended run time, this tool is 5 pounds lighter than a gas unit and is 10 pounds lighter than any other electrified unit available. DEWALT POWERSHIFT represents the next addition to the 100-year legacy of the DEWALT innovation mission to deliver comprehensive end-to-end workflow solutions.\nRaymond DeWalt's founding principles of innovation, safety and productivity remain the core ethos of our company today. DEWALT's future remains strong, and we will lead the way in empowering tradespeople to succeed while defining the next era of industry innovation and minimizing environmental impact. Thank you.\nAnd with that, I'll pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we have achieved streamlining the business and transforming our operations. We are on track to deliver our $2 billion pretax run rate cost savings target by the end of 2025. We achieved approximately $160 million pretax run rate cost savings in the fourth quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to over $1 billion since program inception. This performance is slightly ahead of plan as our team's accelerated savings efforts to offset macroeconomic volume headwinds that were greater than expected throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. Strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to our supply chain transformation to date. In addition to the program, freight rate and demerge savings also contributed to margin improvement starting early in 2023 and holding throughout the year. Consistent with expectations set at transformation inception, we expect strategic sourcing to be the leading contributor to savings, and we expect this to be the case in 2024. Our operations excellence program continues to leverage lean manufacturing principles to improve productivity across both business segments. This work stream will expand in scope during 2024 and drive further cost efficiency in our manufacturing base. The footprint-related projects are progressing on schedule and production transfers into centers of excellence are in the various stages of qualification, testing and execution. Similarly, logistics network optimization programs are also on track with regional distribution center redesigns underway. Concerning complexity reduction, our teams have identified approximately 85,000 SKUs for discontinuation and our assisting customers as they transition to replacement products. We have successfully eliminated over 45,000 SKUs as of the end of 2023, with more expected in 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, supporting the funding of additional growth investments in our core business. As we move into the next phase of our transformation, footprint and product changes, such as those from platforming will become more important and result in a lumpier cost savings trajectory as you would expect. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater.\nMoving to the next slide. Two of our primary areas of focus during 2023 were free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We reduced inventory by approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter inclusive of approximately $100 million attributable to the infrastructure business held for sale accounting. This brings our inventory reduction to approximately $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.9 billion since the middle of 2022. Our disciplined inventory reduction efforts throughout the year supported $853 million of free cash flow generation, which we used to fund our dividend and reduce debt by approximately $280 million versus the prior year. We remain focused on working capital optimization in addition to improving profitability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue to prioritize working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million increasing versus 2023 predominantly in support of the footprint-related transformation initiatives planned for 2024. These items, in combination with organic cash generation, underpin our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million. As a reminder, we expect a typical profile for our working capital as we build inventory for the 2024 Tools & Outdoor spring selling season, resulting in the typical first quarter operating cash outflow. Our priority for capital deployment remains consistent, making transformation investments, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet.\nTurning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the fourth quarter was up 10.3 points versus the prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs, which more than offset the impact from lower volume. Adjusted gross margin finished ahead of plan as we intentionally accelerated supply chain transformation actions in 2023 while navigating weak consumer and outdoor demand and channel inventory conservatism to meet our profitability and cash flow objectives. Additionally, pricing was 0.5 point better than our expectation due to lower promotional mix in the quarter. We will continue our measured and disciplined approach to cost management to moderately improve on our second half 2023 adjusted gross margin gains into the first half of 2024, while managing the margin pressures that accompany the outdoor selling season. This is notable given that we are able to deliver second half 2023 adjusted gross margin, 1 point above the high end of our initial '23 guidance, demonstrating the transformation is on our targeted trajectory. We are planning for adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year 2024 and expect to exit the year in the low 30s, consistent with prior expectations. We are leveraging our $0.5 billion of cost reductions from the supply chain transformation and working hard to navigate another year without a macroeconomic tailwind. We made significant progress throughout 2023 on our journey to restore our historical 35% plus adjusted gross margin, and our efforts are enabling incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth.\nNow let's turn to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. To reiterate, we are planning for 2024 to be another year where we prioritize cash flow generation and gross margin improvement. We are initiating a full year free cash flow guidance range of $600 million to $800 million, GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect relative strength in demand for professional tools in some of our industrial markets. Conversely, we are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. Together, these dynamics result in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for our markets. We are planning for organic revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint, supported by targeted share gains in our businesses. Our EPS range contemplates plus or minus 2 points of volume growth with the variation representing the market demand scenarios in the plan. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat at the midpoint, behind our focus to win with the Pro through industry-leading innovation, investments in field resources and consumer share gains, leveraging our strong portfolio of brands. The Industrial segment revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive organically, primarily driven by aerospace market recovery as well as leveraging our core business model and electrification to deliver share gains. Industrial growth in 2024 is expected to be moderated by infrastructure destocking in Q1 before the closure of the signed divestiture and expected softness in general industrial fastening markets. We will continue to invest for long-term organic growth and share gain throughout 2024 and plan to invest an incremental $100 million to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley brand. Our planning expectation is that SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2024 remains consistent with our recent fourth quarter around 21%, which includes investments.\nTurning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to approximately 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to up slightly versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the previously announced divestiture of the infrastructure business. For additional context around infrastructure, our guidance assumes approximately $100 million of first quarter sales with the divestiture closing at the end of the quarter Thereafter, we have excluded the profit and assume the proceeds will be used to reduce our commercial paper debt balance. With these assumptions, we've established a $1 adjusted EPS range. with the largest contributor being market demand variability. We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin through our transformation program. We will manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year given the macro uncertainty but we will be working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth.\nTurning to the other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step up in 2024 to 10% with the first 3 quarters generally in the mid-20s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and we currently expect these to occur in the fourth quarter. Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 13% of the full year at the midpoint. The EPS for the first quarter is impacted by the tax profile I discussed earlier and a heavier contribution from interest expense associated with the expected first quarter commercial paper debt balance. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA as a percentage of the full year is expected to be over 20% and consistent with pre-pandemic history. First quarter total company organic sales growth is expected to be down low single digits, primarily due to the same factors driving fourth quarter '23 softness. Adjusted EBITDA margins are planned to be up strongly versus prior year, leveraging the carryover benefits of the program and comping the destocking period.\nIn summary, 2024 represents another step along our transformation journey with a focus on gross margin and cash while targeting share gains in a stable but tough macro environment. We believe our actions continue to position the company for long-term growth and shareholder return.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. We embarked on a bold transformation in the middle of 2022 to set Stanley Black & Decker are on a path to drive strong long-term shareholder returns through sustainable growth, profitability and cash flow improvements. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, supporting the acceleration of organic growth behind our most powerful brands, particularly DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley. In the face of dynamic markets, we're focused on delivering best-in-class product innovation, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control and driving share gain in our core markets. I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company capable of gaining market share consistently over the long term. With the best people, the most iconic brands and the highest quality innovation engine in the industry.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 third quarter webcast. On the webcast, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.\nOur earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11:00 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2023 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter performance reflects the continued successful advancement of our strategic business transformation. Our focused execution resulted in improvements versus prior year in adjusted gross margin and earnings per share as well as free cash flow.\nReflecting on our journey over the last 5 quarters, we have made significant progress. One, our cost and inventory position is healthier behind the momentum of our supply chain transformation, and we are confident in the runway for this to continue. Two, our execution is stronger and the results now demonstrate the focus across the organization to enhance the customer experience and improve our financial position.\nThree, our performance to date provides a solid foundation for the additional investments we are launching in innovation and market activation to capture the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve. Four, our view is that the markets will remain dynamic. Our focus is on delivering best-in-class product innovation through our portfolio of world-class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control and driving share gain in our core markets, all aim to further improve margin, earnings and cash flow.\nWhile there are many important steps ahead of us on our journey, I am confident that we have the right strategy, a highly capable and motivated leadership team and a strong competitive position to successfully execute our transformation.\nShifting now to our third quarter performance. Revenue was $4 billion, which was down versus the prior year, primarily due to lower outdoor and DIY volume. The demand for our Pro Tools as well as automotive and aerospace fasteners remained healthy and demonstrated growth in the quarter.\nAcross our end markets, the U.S. retail point of sale for our Tools & Outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels. As we assess our competitive positions and demand trends, we believe that we are stabilizing our share position in a mixed market environment while we continue to invest in market activation and field resources to -- future share gains.\nOur global cost reduction program delivered $215 million of pretax run rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $2 billion run rate savings by the end of 2025. Adjusted gross margin rose to 27.6%, a 400 basis point sequential improvement and 290 basis points favorable as compared to last year.\nThe benefits from our inventory optimization and supply chain transformation are now clearly being reflected in our performance. As we navigate uncertain market conditions, we are continuing to focus on what is in our control to improve our margins.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect additional sequential and year-over-year gross margin gains. We delivered approximately $300 million of inventory reduction this quarter, which brings us to $1.7 billion reduction since mid-2022 when we started this journey. This contributed to over $360 million of Q3 free cash flow generation, which supported our quarterly dividend and $285 million of debt reduction in the quarter.\nBenefits from lower supply chain costs contributed to third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05, which was better than our plan. Our year-to-date performance supports increasing our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $1.10 up to $1.40, which would be up $0.25 at the midpoint.\nI want to thank our 50,000-plus employees around the world for their focus, dedication and passion that contributed to another successful step forward in the third quarter. Our progress is encouraging and I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of organic growth, profitability and cash flow as well as strong long-term shareholder returns.\nNow shifting to our third quarter segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools & Outdoor results. Third quarter Industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year as price realization and currency were more than offset by lower volume and a 3-point impact from our Q3 2022 Oil & Gas business divestiture. We improved Industrial's adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by continued price realization and cost actions to deliver adjusted operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. [ This ] represents strong execution and continued year-over-year margin expansion for our Industrial team.\nWithin the segment Engineered Fastening, organic revenues were up 6%, including aerospace growth of 29% and auto growth of 9% as we continue to capture the strong cyclical recoveries in these markets, which was partially offset by what occurred in industrial fastening. Our attachment tool business experienced organic revenue declines primarily as a result of customer destocking to normalize their inventory levels.\nThe long-term fundamentals for growth remains solid in all these businesses, and we believe the temporary channel inventory destocking in attachment tools will be complete as we exit 2023.\nI want to thank the Industrial business for their strong execution. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margin for the segment. We are excited by the runway for growth, share gain and operating leverage in these businesses.\nI will now turn the call over to Chris, to review our Tools & Outdoor performance.\n\nChristopher John Nelson\n\nPresident of HVAC, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. I am now at the 4.5 month mark at Stanley Black & Decker and this period has really reinforced my excitement about the future for this business. I've spent my time with end users, customers and our passionate and highly capable Tools & Outdoor organization. We have iconic brands such as DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY and CUB CADET, a strong pipeline of innovation and customers and users who are eager for our newest products. We remain focused on capturing that opportunity.\nWe are rapidly making progress with our transformation. The organization remains committed to supporting the necessary cost efficiencies as we prioritize the additional investments in innovation, brand support and commercial resources that will be most impactful to reaccelerate growth and share gain in the market.\nNow turning to the Tools & Outdoor third quarter performance. Total revenue was $3.4 billion, down 5% organically versus prior year as a result of lower consumer outdoor and DIY market demand. Our tools, SBUs, in aggregate, were positive organically in the quarter, excluding the Russia business exit, while outdoor was down 23%, consistent with our expectations.\nPrice for the segment was down 2 points in the period as we successfully regained margin-accretive cordless promotions consistent with historical activity. We made substantial progress in improving adjusted operating margin to 9.3%. This was a sequential step-up of 480 basis points and 250 basis points better than last year. This improvement was driven by reduced sell-through of high-cost inventory, supply chain transformation savings and reduced shipping costs, which were partially offset by lower organic revenue.\nIn terms of performance by region, North America was down mid-single digits organically. Similar to the overall segment, North America tools organic growth was positive, while outdoor declined. U.S. retail point of sale for the quarter remained above prepandemic 2019 levels, supported by strength in professional demand and price. Third quarter POS for DEWALT was positive versus last year, supported by promotions. Our Pro inspired new product offerings and sustained professional demand.\nOur European organic revenue was down 3%, with bright spots from double-digit organic growth in the U.K. and low single-digit growth in the Nordics. We are leveraging targeted programs to capture professional share with DEWALT cordless tools.\nIn emerging markets, we grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 4%. Solid emerging markets performance was led by Latin America, which has now recorded 4 consecutive quarters of organic growth. We have seen notable strength in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels.\nMoving to our strategic business unit performance. The hand tools business grew 2% organically versus prior year. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in North America and Latin America, supported by expanded offerings at our retailers and strong new product sales. Power tools declined 2% organically, pressured by consumer tools. Pro-driven momentum, coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain, is supporting enhanced service levels and promotional opportunities.\nTransitioning to outdoor, organic revenue declined due to market demand choppiness as the industry resets from the pandemic era. This resulted in fewer shipments in the quarter as there are elevated inventory levels globally impacting replenishment cycles. Despite the current market environment, we are excited about the long-term opportunity in bringing leading innovation to outdoor across our powerful brands.\nI want to thank the team for their strong execution in the quarter as we continue to focus on winning with our customers and capturing this amazing growth, margin and shareholder return opportunity.\nTurning to the next slide. I would like now to highlight a few examples of how we are evolving our trade-focused offerings and cordless outdoor expansion.\nWith professional tradespeople and end-user innovation top of mind, we recently launched the DEWALT 20-volt max 0.5-inch high-torque impact wrench. This is the industry's highest rated max torque cordless impact wrench in its class, ideal for use in heavy-duty applications. We also introduced the world's first battery charger box, the DEWALT Puff System 2.0 dual port charger. Users now can protect, store and charge to wall batteries in a durable, weather-resistant container to keep professionals productive despite rough job site conditions.\nIn outdoor, as we gear up for winter, DEWALT has entered the snow category with the 60-volt MAX single-stage snowblower. Powered by two FLEXVOLT batteries, it is engineered to tackle tough demands and break down heavy wet or pack snow. Our Pro Inspire innovation road map will continue to introduce solutions across our categories that enhance safety on the job site while elevating power and performance.\nNow changing gears to DEWALT's new involvement with our social responsibility efforts. We are working to close the trade skills gap and shaping the future of construction technology and the electrical and plumbing trades. In the third quarter, we opened the 2023 DEWALT Grow the Trees Grant and Trade Scholarship Program. These initiatives provide nonprofits with the necessary resources to train, reskill and prepare tomorrow's trades people by directly supporting end-user trade education. This is a great example of our broader commitment to invest $30 million to grow trade skills by 2027.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Chris. I appreciate the energy and perspective that you have brought to the team, and I am excited to continue our company's strategic business transformation with you as a key leader on our strong management team.\nTurning to the next slide. I would like to reinforce the focus areas across our company's transformation. One, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end users and various channel customers.\nTwo, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margin to historical 35% plus levels while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand.\nThree, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. And then four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic revenue growth of 2 to 3x the market.\nWe believe this strategy will ensure our best -- product innovation is maintained while we continue to meet or exceed the expectations of our end users, and we dramatically improve the channel customer experience. In parallel, we will maximize cost opportunities within our control to fuel investment as we deliver our margin, earnings and cash flow goals.\nAs our margins expand, our focus is to accelerate share gains. We are prioritizing innovation and market activation investments across our powerful brands, and targeting the best prospects to maximize share gain growth and return.\nWe continue to benefit from being a simpler, more focused company across Tools & Outdoor and Industrial. And we expect over the next 12 to 18 months, we will find opportunities for further simplification across our businesses.\nAs we evaluate where to invest and the best ways to maximize shareholder return, we will continue to take a pragmatic view of our portfolio of businesses. Our track record demonstrates we will act decisively when the time is right on those portfolio decisions.\nI will now turn the call over to Pat, to share the latest progress updates on our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our revised outlook for the year. Pat?\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. We continue to generate strong transformation results and go-forward momentum. Our cost reduction program delivered approximately $215 million of pretax run rate cost savings in the quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $875 million since program inception. This positions us well to deliver or slightly exceed our $1 billion run rate savings target this year and to deliver $2 billion run rate savings by 2025.\nAs it relates to the supply chain transformation, strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to supply chain savings since program inception. The early actions focused on strategic components and logistics as well as other areas. We have now covered approximately 2/3 of the targeted procurement spend, establishing a carry-in savings trajectory consistent with that contemplated in the 2024 program target. Our supply chain management and engineering teams will continue to drive sourcing improvement through 2025 and beyond.\nActivating our operations excellence program has also contributed significant savings this year. In the plants, when this has been activated, we are seeing increased productivity leveraging lean manufacturing principles. Our footprint-related projects are progressing on schedule with initial savings to begin this year.\nAs it relates to complexity reduction, our teams are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products with the goal of exiting 30,000 SKUs by the end of 2023. We are confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater. These actions are creating the flexibility to fund additional organic growth investments in our core business.\nTurning to our inventory reduction and gross margin improvement. We reduced inventory by approximately $300 million bringing our year-to-date progress to approximately $880 million. The third quarter inventory reduction supported the generation of approximately $360 million of free cash flow in the period, resulting in one of the strongest third quarter cash generations in the company's history.\nWe have reduced inventory by $1.7 billion since the middle of 2022. We achieved this through improved supply chain conditions, strategic inventory management and the planned production curtailments initiated during the back half of 2022. We expect modest inventory improvement in the fourth quarter, which would bring our full year 2023 inventory reduction to at or near our '23 objective of $1 billion as we prepare for next year's outdoor season and supply chain network changes.\nInventory reduction will be a major contributor to our full year free cash flow target of $600 million to $900 million. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we expect the additional multiyear inventory reduction opportunity to be at or above $1 billion. We expect to pursue further inventory reduction at the pace of $400 million to $500 million per year.\nWe will balance our goal of inventory efficiency with ensuring sufficient working capital to navigate through upcoming manufacturing and distribution network changes without impacting service to customers.\nWe remain focused on increasing profitability and working capital improvements to generate free cash flow. Our priority for capital deployment is to fund our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and to further strengthen our balance sheet.\nShifting to profitability. We recorded adjusted gross margin of 27.6%, up 290 basis points versus prior year and improving 400 basis points versus the second quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential gross margin improvement. Year-over-year expansion was driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs, all of which more than offset the impact of lower organic revenue.\nMoving forward, we expect continued adjusted gross margin rate expansion, driven by the benefits of the supply chain transformation. Our guidance calls for adjusted gross margin to incrementally improve again in the fourth quarter.\nNow that the high-cost inventory has turned through the P&L, we expect to continue to deliver expanding adjusted gross margin into the front half and full year 2024, supported by the success of our supply chain transformation. Achieving adjusted gross margins approaching 28% in the third quarter was a significant milestone on our journey to restore 35-plus percent adjusted gross margin.\nThe momentum of our supply chain transformation is translating to sustainable upward progression in our margins and cash flow and will provide resources to fund investment to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth toward our goal of 2 to 3x the market.\nNow turning to our 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been revised to negative $1.45 to negative $1 from negative $1.25 to negative $0.50, primarily related to the third quarter noncash intangibles impairment charge of $124 million. GAAP earnings also include onetime charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor business integration. The current pretax estimate of acquisition-related and other charges is now $425 million to $450 million with approximately half of these expenses being noncash.\nBased on the strength of the third quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $1.10 to $1.40 from a previous guidance range of $0.70 to $1.30.\nWe delivered a strong third quarter cash performance and are maintaining our full year free cash flow target of $600 million to $900 million. We expect fourth quarter cash flow to be supported by positive cash earnings, inventory reduction and the typical seasonal receivables reduction in Tools & Outdoor.\nThe organic growth outlook for the year is unchanged with the total company expected to be down mid-single digits. This implies a revenue midpoint of $15.9 billion for the year, and includes estimated risks for auto strikes and continued infrastructure customer destocking.\nTurning to important remaining elements of guidance. Our expectation is for production to continue to normalize in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to invest to drive organic growth and share gains. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized innovation and market activation investment with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next 3 years.\nWe expect fourth quarter adjusted operating profit to approximate $290 million with adjusted gross margin to sequentially improve to the 28% zone, both at the midpoint of our guidance. This continues the strong momentum from our cost reduction program while prioritizing strategic investments in the business.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back over to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of progress on our journey of transforming Stanley Black & Decker. Consistent successful execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, which will accelerate organic growth behind our most powerful brands.\nAs we continue to focus on what we can control to be successful, I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company with our great people, amazing brands, and industry-leading end-user inspired innovation. We believe the outcome of our transformation will produce a sustainable market share gaining machine.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange.\nMr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 Second Quarter Webcast.\nOn the webcast, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. And joining us for Q&A this morning is Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor.\nOur earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning; and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available, beginning at 11:00 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Pat will review our second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to our cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis. And good morning, everyone.\nStanley Black & Decker's second quarter performance represented strong execution across the organization driving significant progress towards our business transformation objectives on multiple fronts. Before I get into the results, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Chris Nelson to our leadership team; and we have him joining us on the call for Q&A today. Chris started in June as our Chief Operating Officer and President of our Tools & Outdoor business. Chris is an experienced global business leader with strong industry knowledge and a successful track record of implementing growth strategies which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion. I am excited to see Chris assume leadership of the Tools & Outdoor business. He is bringing new energy and perspective which will further position us for strong execution and faster profitable growth. Welcome, Chris.\nWith this critical appointment, Stanley Black & Decker's senior leadership team is now in place. Together, we will bring our shared vision to life, optimizing the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands as we execute our strategy to generate sustainable growth and margin expansion.\nAs you will hear from Pat in a few moments, our cost and supply chain optimization program is ahead of plan through the first 6 months of 2023 and building momentum. The compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve, combined with the progress we've made transforming our business, including our improved cost position, gives us the confidence to pursue further growth investments in the second half of this year. Deploying these growth investments as part of our $300 million to $500 million target over the next 3 years is intended to accelerate market share gains. As we drive these investment priorities, we are also maintaining our commitment to return value to our shareholders, and to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend, amounting to $0.81 per share.\nShifting now to our second quarter performance. We demonstrated that we are continuing to advance our transformation journey and ahead of the planned program. Specifically, we reduced inventory by nearly $400 million in Q2, which brings our aggregate program to-date reduction to $1.4 billion since mid-2022. Our global cost reduction program delivered $230 million of pretax run rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $1 billion of annualized savings by the end of this year.\nAdjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And all of these actions translated into $200 million of free cash flow in Q2.\nSecond quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, which was down versus the prior year due to lower consumer outdoor and DIY volume, as rising interest rates have tempered consumer spending in addition to the negative year-over-year impact of the oil and gas divestiture completed last year. That said, demand remains solid for the professional side of the market, which represents roughly 70% of our tools business.\nAs it relates to the end markets, the U.S. retail point of sale for our tools and outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand. Both tools and outdoor POS through the first 4 weeks of July is growing versus prior year, a potentially positive signal for the back half of 2023. We are also encouraged by a stabilizing residential construction market despite the rising interest rate cycle. U.S. home starts are running at a pace of 1.4 million units in June, a strong signal that demand for housing remains sound. This is complemented by U.S. permits to build single-family homes rising to a 1-year high and positive trends in housing completions. Additionally, contractor backlog in the U.S. remains healthy for repair and remodel activity. The European markets are experiencing similar trends with softer DIY markets balanced with a healthier level of construction activity and professionals with backlogs through the end of this year.\nAnd then finally, our channel partners continue to be focused on optimizing inventory levels. And we expect that to be a modest headwind throughout 2023.\nAcross our industrial end markets, we are seeing continued strength in global automotive and aerospace, so while the end markets across Stanley Black & Decker remain relatively stable, with pockets of strength, we are monitoring the demand environment and continue to plan for a range of outcomes and will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. Operationally, we continue to be focused on the prioritization of inventory reduction and cash generation.\nWith 2Q adjusted diluted EPS coming in at a loss of $0.11, which was better than our plan, due to the solid progress we have made on our key financial goals in the first half, we are narrowing our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $0.70 up to $1.30. and narrowing our free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation.\nNow let me walk through the details of our business segment performance, beginning with Tools & Outdoor. Total revenue was $3.5 billion, down 5% organically versus prior year, as favorable price realization was more than offset by volume decline. We continue to make progress on the Tools & Outdoor adjusted operating margin, which was 4.5%, up 150 basis points sequentially driven by benefits from volume leverage and cost control. Versus prior year, our operating margin rate was down, as price realization was more than offset by selling through high-cost inventory, planned production curtailment costs and lower volume.\nI would now like to provide some more detail on our various Tools & Outdoor geographies. North America was down mid-single digits organically, weighted by lower consumer outdoor and DIY tool demand as well as modest customer destocking. Organic revenues were stronger sequentially as we lapped tougher comparables and saw benefits from better order fill rates with our customers while leveraging strength and professional demand. Our European revenue was down 1% organically, with bright spots in the U.K. and Southern regions as they both posted high single-digit organic growth. The emerging markets performance was down 3% organically. However, when you exclude the impact from our Russian business exit, the remaining countries had high single-digit organic growth. This was led by strong demand in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels.\nMoving to our strategic business unit performance. We experienced an outdoor organic revenue decline of 12%. As widely reported by many in this industry, the challenging start to the outdoor season persisted for the entire season; and we did experience notable softness in POS and replenishment in the quarter, especially surrounding higher-price-point retail products. The hand tools business was flat organically versus prior year and overcame softer DIY volume with international growth and certain category strength. Notably, DEWALT's stored solution growth, including the expanded softline and tough system 2.0 portfolio offerings introduced earlier this year. Power tools declined 4% organically as softer consumer market demand persisted and customers remained cautious with inventory levels. This result was notably better than the first quarter, as we saw continued pro momentum coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain leading to better service levels and increased promotional opportunities, particularly with DEWALT and CRAFTSMAN.\nNow shifting to our Industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter. The total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2Q 2022, as price realization was more than offset by last year's oil and gas divestiture and currency. We improved adjusted operating margin by 370 basis points versus prior year, including continued price realization and cost actions, to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13%. This represents strong execution and a great financial outcome this quarter for our Industrial team.\nWithin the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 8%, including aerospace growth of 31% and auto growth of 15% as we captured cyclical rebound in these markets along with share gains. This favorable performance was partially offset by industrial fastening and Attachment Tools organic revenue decline primarily as a result of customers destocking to optimize their inventory levels. While long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid, we believe temporary channel inventory reductions will continue to impact these industrial businesses in the second half of the year as well.\nIn summary, the team continues to navigate market conditions with several pockets of strength and a few areas of pressure while we continue to improve our margins. I want to thank the entire Stanley Black & Decker organization, for your focus on our key priorities. The progress to date is very encouraging and energizing as we take the next several steps of our business transformational journey.\nTurning to the next slide, I would like to underscore the importance of the strategy that we launched a year ago to transform Stanley Black & Decker to accelerate market share gains and drive consistent organic growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus: one, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end users and various channel customers; two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35%-plus levels while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization; and four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of 2 to 3x the market.\nOur business transformation is our path to continuing to enhance our customer and end user experiences while delivering on our financial commitments and enabling the pursuit of strategic growth investments behind our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercial activation. Key investments in innovation coupled with market activation are being accelerated to maximize the impact of our product launches with our global customers and end users. For example, our fully integrated CRAFTSMAN campaign was built to drive traffic to our key retail partners, incent repeat purchases and engage new users. To date, we've shown strong initial results breaking through the industry clutter. Since the campaign launched in the second quarter, we've driven both online and off-line traffic to retail and demonstrated improved tools point-of-sale run rate versus the prior year to support brand market share growth. We're excited to see continued positive momentum from this exciting CRAFTSMAN brand campaign. We are also leveraging the strength of our DEWALT brand with a pro-inspired product road map to expand core innovation as we release enhanced product offerings to improve the end user experience.\nWe recently launched 2 new DEWALT sealed head ratchets, the 20-volt MAX XR as well as the XTREME 12-volt MAX options, delivering power, versatility and durability. Engineered with the professional in mind, particularly automotive, electrical and mechanical trades people, the innovative design meets the needs of pros across industries on any job site. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR brushless, cordless rivet tools were also introduced this quarter, designed for precision fastening and prefabrication, assembly, HVAC, roofing and automotive applications. These tools have features such as onboard nosepiece storage and a [indiscernible] collector to catch rivets after each shot. Lastly, we introduced a new DEWALT 25-foot LED tape measure, a great example of core innovation within our tough series product line. Our engineering team continues to advance our innovation road map with best-in-class products and solutions for our end users as we electrify and enhance safety on the job site as well as push the balance of power and performance across our categories.\nLet me now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates on our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our latest outlook.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThank you. And good morning, everyone.\nAs Don mentioned, we made meaningful progress on our transformation in the quarter and first half of the year. Our cost reduction program is on track to deliver $1 billion of pretax run rate savings in 2023 and is modestly ahead of plan year-to-date. Our simplification and prioritization efforts, coupled with our supply chain transformation, delivered $230 million of run rate savings in the second quarter, totaling $460 million year-to-date and $660 million since program inception. Approximately half of our 2023 savings were manufacturing costs related, and as such, we'll begin to see these benefits turn through inventory off the balance sheet and onto the P&L, starting in the second half and continuing to build in 2024.\nOur organization is bringing our vision for the supply chain of the future to life with persistent sustainable progress. Strategic sourcing is a major contributor of 2023 savings and is ahead of plan. We have the capabilities in place to ensure changes are executed successfully, and we are currently activating additional RFPs to secure further savings. The momentum behind the SBD Operating Model along with lean manufacturing practices is yielding sustainable productivity efficiencies such as alleviating manufacturing bottlenecks as well as reducing process waste and production downtime. This will become an important source of savings in the coming months and quarters. Our manufacturing and logistics network optimization remains on track as we work to improve the efficiency and utilization of the asset base. Finally, as it relates to our complexity reduction, the SKU rationalization initiative is progressing in an orderly fashion. At this stage, we have approved the reduction of approximately 70,000 SKUs. We are working with our customers to assist with their transition to replacement products over the coming quarters. We have now decommissioned over 20,000 SKUs. We believe that, as we exit the remaining 50,000 offerings, we will have suitable substitutes that will mitigate effectively all of the potential revenue risk, which we size at less than $50 million annually. We believe managing this in a methodical way creates value via complexity reduction without undue disruption to our customers or loss of share.\nWe are pleased with the progress of our global cost reduction program and are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2025.\nTurning to our inventory reduction progress and gross margin trajectory. In the second quarter, we reduced inventory by $375 million, bringing our year-to-date progress to $575 million. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved approximately $1.4 billion in inventory reduction through the improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022. To contextualize our first half performance: The $575 million reduction compares favorably to the average pre-pandemic first half inventory build of approximately $400 million. We are expecting our full year 2023 inventory reduction to be between $700 million and $900 million, which represents a DSI that is about 155 days.\nWe remain committed to ongoing inventory productivity improvement to generate cash flow that will be used to strengthen our balance sheet while supporting our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends.\nTurning to gross margin. The pace of improvement has been modestly ahead of expectations, as transformation execution and freight deflation are favorable to plan. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 23.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. The impact from liquidating high-cost inventory and the production curtailments represented approximately 400 to 500 basis points of margin headwinds in the second quarter. Moving forward, we expect continued sequential improvement in adjusted gross margin driven by a lower impact from turning high-cost inventory and an increased benefit as our cost transformation improves the P&L. Assuming the demand levels and other assumptions that underpin our guidance, we expect adjusted gross margin to be 27% to 29% in the second half, a strong improvement versus recent quarters. While this is a significant step up from the front half performance, we have line of sight into the cost savings already generated and on the balance sheet. That corresponds to lower cost of sales and margin improvement in the coming quarters.\nTo conclude. We're starting to reap the benefits from the inventory reductions and supply chain transformation, and we remain focused on delivering our targeted adjusted gross margin of 35-plus percent by 2025.\nNow turning to 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been narrowed to negative $1.25 to negative $0.50 from negative $1.65 to positive $0.60, inclusive of onetime charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pretax charges estimate was narrowed to $300 million to $325 million, with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash.\nThe 2023 quarterly profile of GAAP taxes and GAAP earnings per share is significantly impacted by the pretax loss in the first half and the interim tax impact of certain benefits factored into our annual effective tax rate assumption. However, as we expect to generate pretax income in the second half, this interim tax benefit will reverse. And we expect our full year tax rate to be relatively consistent with prior guidance. In parallel, we are also narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $0.70 to $1.30 from a previous guidance range of $0 to $2.\nWe are keeping the $1 midpoint consistent with the prior guidance framework. Versus our previous expectation, we have assumed modestly lower organic growth offset by better gross margin. At the midpoint, this results in an improved full year adjusted operating profit and margin. This stronger operating performance is offset by an approximate $0.25 impact from higher interest and other expenses below the line, of which 40% to 50% is interest rate-driven.\nWe are narrowing our full year free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million from $500 million to $1 billion. We expect second half cash flow to be supported by positive net income, a further reduction in inventory and the normal Tools & Outdoor seasonal benefit from working capital.\nWe are planning for total company organic growth to be down mid-single digits for the year. In terms of the business segment outlook, Tools & Outdoor total organic revenue is expected to be down mid- to high single digits for the year, incorporating the softer outlook in outdoor as well as expectations for continued DIY softness and channel inventory conservatism. We are expecting to regain cordless power tool promotions in the second half, reflecting our improved supply position; and as such, pricing is assumed to be relatively flat to slightly negative, consistent with these activities. We continue to see the pro tool user holding strong. And at this point, we believe the range of outcomes for volume cover some variability for the U.S. consumer and DIY demand balanced with the potential for stronger professional demand in the back half. In Industrial, we expect flat to low single-digit organic growth on a full year basis supported by cyclical rebound in aerospace and auto. This is modestly lower than our prior outlook as we incorporate an assumption for continued customer destocking in Attachment Tools and industrial fastening.\nProduction normalization and the pace of growth investments will both be flexed based on demand. We are planning for production to normalize in the fourth quarter, recognizing the lower volumes. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to reinvesting to drive organic growth. Our focus is to deliver on our financial expectations while utilizing gross margin improvements to fund growth investments. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized investments, with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next 3 years. Clearly our willingness to invest increases as we progress along our gross margin expansion trajectory.\nWe expect second half adjusted operating margins to be in the mid- to high single digits as our cost efficiencies offset volume pressures.\nTurning to the important remaining elements of guidance. The expectation for the third quarter would be a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and a lesser impact from destocking. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter is planned to be approximately 80% of the full year adjusted EPS amount. And due to losses within the first half, the back half adjusted EPS will be more than 100% of the full year total adjusted EPS.\nSo in summary. We are exiting the first half with strong momentum across our cost savings and cash generation initiatives. With some of the more significant impacts from our inventory reductions now in the rearview mirror, we are focusing on driving the items within our control to deliver further margin improvement and to fund investment. We continue to manage the business with the long term in mind. And we believe we have the right strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market organic growth with margin expansion and enhanced shareholder returns.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back over to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat.\nWe are pleased to report another quarter of meaningful progress related to our transformation journey. Successful execution against our plans gives us the confidence to increase our focus on reinvestment towards faster growth as we fuel our team with more resources to unleash the power of our amazing brands, strengthen the innovation machine and stimulate demand with enhanced end user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. I am proud to be alongside the best people, the best brands and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. As we continue to focus on what we could control to be successful, I am confident that we are recreating a significant market share-gaining machine.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don.\nShannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 first quarter webcast. the webcast, in addition to myself, Don Allen, President and CEO; and Pat Hallinan, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nOur earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don and Pat will review our 2023 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty.\nIt's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I am extremely pleased to have Patrick Hallinan on board and joining our call today at Stanley Black & Decker's newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Pat brings to the team a deep track record of delivering business performance, growth and value creation and complex competitive consumer branded businesses.\nFollowing my remarks, Pat will take you through the financial highlights as well as our current outlook. Welcome, Pat.\nEarlier this week, we also announced that Chris Nelson will be joining the company in mid-June as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President and President of Tools & Outdoor. Chris is an experienced global leader with exceptional industry knowledge and existing relationships with many of our customers. His track record of success implementing growth strategies, which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion, make him the ideal leader for our tools and outdoor business.\nI look forward to partnering with Pat, Chris and the entire leadership team to streamline and optimize the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands, as we execute our strategy and generate sustainable growth.\nIn terms of our Q1 performance, we continue to build momentum and make strong progress as the organization remains focused on our business transformation plan. We took additional steps forward in the quarter to better serve our customers and deliver for key stakeholders by reducing inventory, leveraging enhanced cost controls and optimizing our global supply chain, while continuing to increase our investments in innovation and end user activation.\nThe global cost reduction program delivered $230 million in pretax run rate savings this quarter, which is modestly ahead of plan. Since we launched the program, we've captured a total of $430 million of annualized savings. This is a great start, and we believe we are on track to achieve the expected $1 billion of total program run rate savings by year-end.\nInventory reduction is also ahead of plan, with an incremental $200 million improvement in the quarter. Even while we strategically build inventory in some categories to prepare for the upcoming outdoor and Father's Day merchandising season, we have now reduced approximately $1 billion of inventory since mid-2022. I'm encouraged by our progress thus far, and I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company for a strong long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability and shareholder return.\nOur first quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was in line with Q4 2022. This was down versus prior year as price realization and solid industrial and professional construction demand was more than offset by lower consumer and DIY volume, currency and the oil and gas business divestiture.\nLet me now provide some perspective on end market demand. The U.S. retail point of sale for our tools and outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy [indiscernible]. The outdoor season had a slow start in March, but April weekly point-of-sale trends have been encouraging.\nAdjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.1%, up 360 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2022. While there still is more work to be done, we are seeing adjusted gross margin improved, as destocking impacts moderate.\nAdjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.41, significantly impacted by our planned prioritization efforts around inventory reduction. We are committed to advancing our business transformation plan and continuing our journey forward with persistent focus on what is within our control.\nWe are monitoring the demand environment and global economic dynamics and planning for a range of outcomes, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the possibility of improvement as well as the prospect of a further demand slowdown. We have planned for all 3 of these scenarios, and we'll respond accordingly if we see current trends shift.\nWe are reiterating our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $0 to $2 as well as our free cash flow guidance of $500 million to $1 billion. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation.\nAs we generate cost savings, we are continuing to make strategic investment in iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercialization activation to position the business for sustainable growth and margin expansion. This includes hiring additional engineers focused on product platforming, electrification and innovation as well as feet on the street to elevate user activation activities, which will ensure we extend the leadership positions of these iconic brands.\nOur priorities in 2023 remain unchanged: one, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; two, sequential improvement in our adjusted gross margin as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our tools and outdoor business.\nSuccessfully executing these priorities will result in a stronger balance sheet and significantly improved EBITDA in the second half of 2023 as we head into 2024.\nNow let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, revenue was $3.3 billion, a decline of 13% as price realization was more than offset by a decline in volume and a negative impact from currency. Volume was impacted by lower consumer and DIY market demand, modestly reduced channel inventory and a slow start to the retail outdoor season due to a cold March, with temperatures well below the 5-year average.\nTools & Outdoor adjusted operating margin was 3%, down versus the prior year, as price realization was more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailments and lower volume.\nNorth America and Europe were both down 12% organically, as both regions were impacted by the factors covered for the overall segment. Emerging markets were down 2% organically, but excluding the impacts from our Russian business exit, the region had 6% organic growth. This was led by strength in Brazil, China and the Middle East.\nMoving to our strategic business unit performance, power tools and hand tools were primarily impacted by softer consumer demand, declining organically 12% and 6%, respectively. The outdoor business declined 16% organically, largely impacted by softer consumer demand and the cooler weather.\nThe slow start to the season pressured our outdoor results versus planned by approximately 5 to 6 points. We are monitoring demand to determine if this could potentially be recaptured in 2023, with encouraging POS in recent weeks signaling the season is now ramping up.\nA key growth area for outdoor is leveraging the 2,500 pro dealers that we acquired with our acquisitions. This channel delivered a strong performance in the quarter and was up double digits year-over-year. Pro products under our Cub Cadet and Hussle Brands had a solid start, and we are building traction with our DEWALT cordless handheld products across the dealer network.\nNow shifting to our industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter, with double-digit operating margin. Total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year's oil and gas divestiture, currency and volume.\nThe team leveraged price realization and productivity to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11%, up 410 basis points versus the prior year. Within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 3% led by aerospace growth to 30% and auto growth of 7%, offset by softer industrial markets.\nAttachment Tools organic revenue were up 5% driven by strategic pricing actions and continued conversion of this business' significant backlog.\nIn summary, this was a job well done across the board by our team. We continue to reduce inventory and drove improved gross margins in a mixed revenue environment. My thanks to the entire team as we maintained our focus on the right areas, and we are seeing the results of our efforts.\nOn the next slide, I would like to review our long-term strategy that we launched last July as we transformed Stanley Black & Decker to drive consistent organic growth at accelerated levels well above market growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus: one, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users; two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization; and four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of 2 to 3x the market.\nOur business transformation remains on track to deliver on these financial commitments as we strive to elevate our customer and end user experiences to world-class levels. The streamlining of our company and the supply chain initiatives are tracking to expectations and continuing to gain momentum. The 4 value creation streams within our supply chain transformation strategy are advancing, with meaningful strides forward and $110 million of savings achieved in the first quarter.\nOur global team is activating against our strategy with speed. The energy and passion is evident. And I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to our operations associates across the globe. We have made so much progress in the last 9 months, and every completed milestone is contributing to our shared vision for the supply chain of the future.\nNow a few updates in this particular area. Within the SKU rationalization and product platforming value stream, we have approved the reduction of 60,000 SKUs across the portfolio, of which 16,000 are now decommissioned. The remaining balance is no longer being manufactured, and we are working with our customers to transition to new SKUs in the coming quarters.\nStrategic sourcing has been a strong contributor to savings as we complete the $2 billion first tranche of spend assessment. We are on track to achieve the targeted savings. Our supply base will include both existing and new vendors, with a deliberate intent to improve geographic diversification and consolidation.\nOur dedicated team is capturing cost savings, while deploying new processes to ensure sourcing changes are executed successfully. Our initial announcements related to the manufacturing footprint optimization were made in March, which includes site expansion, transformations into manufacturing centers of excellence as well as site consolidation.\nWe are on track with our expectations and are taking a holistic approach to our manufacturing base and logistics network to ensure we optimize the efficiency and utilization of our asset base.\nFinally, we are increasing our focus on manufacturing excellence and reemphasizing the SBD operating model, along with lean manufacturing practices at our factories. We deployed this playbook at 4 plants in the first quarter. And in March, we kicked off at 9 additional sites.\nWe are seeing strong traction and are capturing improved productivity efficiencies where these tools were activated. We are excited with the progress, and you can expect us to continue to make strides in the coming months and quarters.\nTurning to SG&A. We captured approximately $120 million of savings this quarter and are on pace for $500 million of pretax savings by the end of the year from simplifying the corporate structure, streamlining leadership spans of control and organizational layers, and reducing indirect spend.\nWe are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of annualized savings by 2025 from this program.\nA key tenet of our strategy is the acceleration of investment in innovation and electrification. We are making deliberate strategic investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. A couple of highlights from this year's outdoor season.\nIn terms of delivering innovative cordless products, the Craftsman 20-volt lineup is designed for extended run time and better performance. This includes the new brushless string trimmer that is lighter weight than its gas-powered equivalent and carries more run time and force than prior generation.\nThe new cordless pressure washer also joins this lineup, in addition to the range of other new 20-volt cordless lawn and garden tools. Continuing to expand our 20-volt system is enabling users to go wherever the work is without the limitation of cords or gas engines. These items are currently available for this season, and we are excited about the initial market reception.\nAdditionally, we just received notice that we won 8 2023 Popular Mechanics Yard and Garden best new product awards across DEWALT Craftsman and Black & Decker. In addition to the Craftsman offerings just highlighted, the DEWALT Pruning saw and string trimmer were awarded as Best for Contractors and the Black & Decker pruning chain saw was named Best for light duty use.\nThis is a great recognition of the quality of the innovation we bring to the market and our ability to serve our entire user base from the consumer to the most demanding Pro.\nLet me now turn the call over to Pat for some further financial highlights on the quarter and our latest outlook.\n\nPatrick D. Hallinan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning to everyone. I'm honored to join Stanley Black & Decker, the worldwide leader in tools and outdoor at such a pivotal moment in the company's history. I have tremendous respect for the leadership team and Stanley Black & Decker's iconic portfolio of professional and consumer brands.\nDuring my initial weeks, I have been impressed with the breadth and depth of the company-wide transformation underway, observing the early traction of the multiyear program and the savings captured during the initial phases. It is clear that the company's transformation is progressing rapidly and powerfully. I am energized to help accelerate the company's journey forward and to enhance our long legacy of market-leading innovation and profit performance.\nNow let me walk through the details of the company's progress towards reducing inventory and improving gross margins. We exited last year with $5.9 billion of inventory. We reduced this by over $200 million in the first quarter. Since mid-2022, we have successfully reduced inventory by approximately $1 billion.\nThis achievement was driven by improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of '22 and which continue today. The targeted inventory reduction helped minimize the magnitude of the seasonal working capital build typical of our first quarter.\nAs a frame of reference, our first quarter working capital build has averaged $700 million over the last 5 years, while this quarter, it was $200 million, improving our cash performance primarily via inventory reductions.\nWe are on track to achieve our expected $500 million of first half inventory reduction as we work down raw material and component inventory, while selling out finished goods.\nOur full year 2023 inventory reduction target remains $750 million to $1 billion, to drive significant cash flow generation and to pay down debt, strengthen our balance sheet and back our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends.\nOverall, the pace of our inventory reduction will be demand dependent. And in a few moments, I will cover the range of demand scenarios we are considering within our 2023 guidance.\nTurning to gross margins, which are also improving in a manner consistent with our plan. First quarter adjusted gross margins were approximately 23%, up 360 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter 2022, as we saw a smaller headwind from destocking actions and as our transformation initiatives provide a greater income statement benefit, something we expect to continue.\nProduction curtailments in the first quarter were at levels relatively similar to those in the back half of last year, and the destock impacted gross margin by approximately 400 to 500 basis points. We expect a similar impact to the second quarter, resulting in second quarter adjusted gross margin consistent with that of the first quarter.\nOur base case guidance anticipates the adverse margin impact from our targeted production curtailments and destocking will ease through the year, supporting adjusted gross margin expansion into the mid- to high 20s for the second half of the year.\nThe timing of normalized production and improved gross margin could shift earlier or later, depending on the demand environment and corresponding speed of inventory reduction. We will actively monitor demand and adjust our supply chain to optimize the pace of margin improvement and inventory reduction throughout 2023.\nAn important leading indicator for gross margin is the $110 million of supply chain transformation savings delivered in the first quarter. As these savings turn through inventory later this year, gross margin will expand further. It is encouraging to see the initial progress towards our multiyear target to return adjusted gross margins to the 35-plus percent range.\nWe are prioritizing cash generation, gross margin improvement and balance sheet strength. By executing against these priorities, we are positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation.\nNow turning to 2023 guidance. We are reiterating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $0 to $2 per share. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings range per share to be negative $1.65 to $0.60, inclusive of onetime charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration.\nThe current pretax charges estimate was narrowed to $275 million to $325 million, with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash. We continue to target free cash flow generation of $500 million to $1 billion primarily driven by inventory reduction.\nConsistent with the framework shared in February, we planned and continue to forecast around 3 2023 demand scenarios as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year.\nIn this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low to mid-single digits, incorporating the softer start to the outdoor season. Tools & Outdoor total organic revenue is expected to be down low to mid-single digits, while we expect low single-digit growth for industrial. The base case also assumes that we maintain the production curtailments with the intention to return to normalized production levels during the third quarter.\nAs a result, the under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain second quarter operating margins to low single digits. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve to the mid- to high single-digit range, resulting in full year operating margins in the mid-single digits.\nFinally, the base case includes approximately $125 million of annualized reinvestment targeting Tools & Outdoor growth acceleration and complexity reduction. We plan to be measured with the magnitude and timing of such investments, depending on the demand environment.\nThe second half acceleration scenario contemplates a stronger demand environment, supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. In this scenario, we would expect a quicker normalization of inventory levels and gross margin improvement. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. This scenario would position the company to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half as well as a larger level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation.\nThe downside case reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. If this scenario becomes the macro reality, we would expect full year organic revenues to decline by mid-single digits, with volume declines in both the Tools & Outdoor and industrial segments. In this scenario, production curtailments would likely remain in place through the end of 2023, extending the time line of our gross margin recovery.\nWith lower demand, we would adjust the level of reinvestment in CapEx until we have more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts. We believe it is prudent to maintain these ranges of 2023 demand outcomes, production levels and approaches to reinvestment as we prioritize our transformation and inventory reduction and cash generation.\nTurning to important remaining elements of guidance. For the full year, we expect the below-the-line expenses in total to be relatively similar to the guidance issued in early February. We are building an expectation for higher interest expense, which is offset by a modestly lower 2023 tax expense assumption.\nFor the second quarter, we are expecting a sequential improvement in operating profit primarily from seasonally higher levels of revenue. Adjusted gross margin is planned to be in the low 20s, relatively similar to that of the first quarter. Adjusted EPS is planned to be at a loss of approximately $0.40 per share at the midpoint, incorporating an expectation for a higher tax expense versus the first quarter.\nFree cash flow is expected to be positive in the second quarter primarily from inventory reduction. Our plan calls for earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. This range is similar to our view in February, and we believe this is the appropriate base to build off as we deliver our transformation savings over the next couple of years.\nWe are planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market long-term organic growth and margin expansion.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Pat. We are continuing to forge our path forward. We made solid progress again in the first quarter with strong cost savings, inventory reduction and advancements across all elements of the transformation plan.\nAs we execute against our strategy in 2023 and over the 3-year time horizon, we believe our transformation efforts will begin to drive more material financial benefits. Our focus will be to continue to reinvest $300 million to $500 million of these benefits towards faster growth, as we strengthen the innovation machine and stimulate demand with enhanced end user activation.\nWe believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses, will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability.\nWe have the best people, the best brands and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. Combine this with the passion, energy and commitment I see across the organization every day, and it gives me great confidence that we will focus on what we can control to be successful, and we ultimately will recreate a significant market share gaining machine.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Later, we will move on to question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views.\nSuch statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and, as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34-F Act Filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance marked another meaningful step forward on our journey to streamline and optimize Stanley Black & Decker. Building on our #1 worldwide market position in Tools & Outdoor as well as our leading Industrial business, we continue to focus on advancing our simplification and transformation strategy.\nAcross the second half of 2022, we improved customer fill rates significantly, reduced inventories by $800 million and realized $200 million in efficiency benefits from our leaner organizational structure as well as enhanced cost control in the back office and the supply chain. These actions generated more than $500 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which supported a corresponding similar amount of reduction in our debt, a key objective of our capital allocation plan in the second half of 2022.\nOverall, we are making progress, and I am confident that our strategy and priorities are positioning the company for a strong, sustainable, long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability enhancement and shareholder return. This transformation journey has just started, and significant efforts are still ahead of us. Our success will be dependent on staying agile while maintaining a disciplined approach, which ensures we stay focused on our key set of priorities.\nOur team has seen significant changes over the second half of 2022, and they will lead us through the next phase of the transformation in 2023. I would like to take a moment to thank all of our leaders and employees across the globe and recognize them for their focus, commitment and hard work, especially over the last 7 to 8 months.\nOur 2022 full year revenue reached $16.9 billion, up 11% versus a record of 2021, led by the outdoor power equipment acquisitions as well as 9% organic growth in the Industrial segment and a 7% improvement in price realization. However, these top line growth drivers were partially muted by significant retractions in consumer and DIY demand as well as certain supply chain constraints we experienced in early 2022.\nOur margins were significantly impacted by inflation, and when we chose to prioritize inventory reductions by lowering manufacturing production levels in this last 4 to 5 months of 2022, this was to allow us to generate solid free cash flow as we experienced in the fourth quarter. These negative profitability impacts resulted in a full year adjusted diluted earnings per share being down year-over-year to $4.62.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenues were in line with the prior year at $4 billion. Demand from our professional end markets remained healthy. With our differentiated offerings and improved product availability, we successfully executed our promotional plans in support of the holiday season for our retail partners. Adjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.10, a result of our planned prioritization efforts around inventory reduction and cash generation. Notably, we lowered inventory by $500 million as compared to the end of the third quarter.\nWe entered 2023 prepared to navigate a challenging macroeconomic backdrop as interest rate hikes begin to yield their intended effects. That said, we are committed to advancing our transformation. While there is more work to be done, we have a clear road map forward. We are watching the demand environment and global economic dynamics very closely. Although current demand remains consistent with levels experienced in the back half of last year, we are planning for all scenarios, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the prospect of a further demand slowdown due to intensifying macro pressures.\nWhile changes in demand are difficult to predict, our base case or midpoint of guidance assumes a decline in volume versus 2022 as we believe markets will continue to be challenged during 2023 as new housing starts are projected to decline 15% to 25% and repair and remodel activity will decline modestly year-over-year. We are also prepared to respond if revenue impacts are worse or better than our base case to ensure we appropriately manage the risks and opportunities that could arise.\nThis guidance will have a P&L loss in the front half, which is impacted by our strategic choice to continue to reduce our inventory levels. For the full year, we are guiding an adjusted EPS range of $0 up to $2. Our free cash flow guidance is much stronger at $500 million up to $1 billion in 2023, well ahead of net income as we drive another $750 million up to $1 billion of inventory reduction during the year.\nAs you have heard me say many times over the past year, we believe the long-term view for the industries which our products serve is very positive with powerful generational shifts in the housing, more time at home due to hybrid work, an aging housing stock that needs repair and remodel, the continued improvement in aerospace demand and the acceleration of electrification within the automotive markets. We also have powerful secular drivers in Tools & Outdoor from the shift to cordless power tools and electric-powered outdoor equipment as we leverage our brands and innovation to gain market share.\nOur priorities in 2023 will continue to be aligned with our messaging over the last 6 months: one, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our Tools & Outdoor business.\nOur 2023 guidance base case is planning for an improved profitability performance in the back half of the year as we see more benefits from the transformation program. We believe our annualized EBITDA will achieve a run rate of close to $1.5 billion in the back half. That will be a major step forward in returning our company back to 2019 EBITDA levels, which were just above $2 billion. Given the significant benefits expected to be realized beyond 2023 from our supply chain transformation program, there appears to be a very reasonable glide path to exceed 2019 levels for EBITDA.\nOur teams around the world remain focused on executing our primary areas of long-term strategic focus, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of 2x to 3x the market growth, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; and then prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. We are making deliberate strategic investments in our businesses to position the company to fully capitalize on these long-term opportunities to gain share within the industries that we serve and to accelerate our organic growth.\nWith that in mind, last year, we invested approximately $350 million in research and development, up over 25% versus 2021 and well ahead of our total sales growth. This increase in R&D will ensure we continue to fund incremental investments beyond our core and breakthrough innovation, electrification across the portfolio and market leadership, including digital and end user activation. This is an area where we have a long legacy of key investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. We clearly took another step forward in 2022, and we will again in 2023.\nOur business transformation remains on track, and we are building momentum towards delivering approximately $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of 2023. That will support both gross and operating margin expansion once our inventory destock is complete.\nLet's spend some time on the topic of innovation. We are continuing to release new products and bring advancements and innovation to our industries. Today, I will highlight a few exciting launches. As it relates to outdoor electrification, we are introducing new CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT outdoor offerings.\nFor the 2023 season, CRAFTSMAN will carry a new range of lithium-ion electric ride-on mowers and an expansion of our 20-volt CRAFTSMAN Outdoor Essentials. Notably new brushless string trimmers and blowers as well as a new cordless pressure washer. For the PRO, we are continuing to expand the DEWALT FLEXVOLT 20-volt MAX system, including the addition of a new pruning chainsaw that is lightweight and compact with an 8-inch bar and a high-efficiency brushless motor.\nShifting to professional job site products and solutions, this is another key area for long-term growth. We recently debuted a range of revolutionary tools, accessories and storage solutions for Pros in the commercial concrete and construction industries as we continue to electrify the job site. We are expanding the FLEXVOLT product family with the launch of the world's first cordless in-line SDS MAX Chipping Hammer and Cordless Hex Breaker Hammer.\nWe are also introducing the most powerful cordless DEWALT Large Angle Grinder. All three of these new cordless tools include Perform and Protect safety features as well. Additionally, we have a new DEWALT Tough System Solution for storing, charging and transporting DEWALT 20-volt and FLEXVOLT batteries.\nAnd lastly, our DEWALT product team partnered with CONVERGE, a leading concrete material and operations optimization company, to develop and unveil new concrete DNA compatible sensors. This new product allows DEWALT pros to begin work sooner as users can directly measure concrete hardening using advanced artificial intelligence rather than relying on estimations. In addition, this product helps reduce cement consumption by tailoring the exact amount needed. Together with CONVERGE, we are helping to tackle the challenge of reducing carbon emissions through our product innovation.\nAs the worldwide leader in tools and outdoor, these are prime examples of the types of core and breakthrough innovations that we expect to continue to introduce to our customers and deliver for our end users.\nNow diving a bit deeper into our business transformation. The team has made great progress. We realized $200 million of savings in the second half of 2022 from efficiency benefits, including our organizational changes as well as indirect cost savings. We expect to deliver a cumulative SG&A savings of $500 million by the end of 2023, covering simplification of the corporate structure, streamlined leadership spans of controls and organizational layers and the reduction of indirect spend. Our new organizational structure is now in place, and the teams are activating our priorities.\nAs you saw in our recent announcements, we have brought on two new business leaders who are critical for our transformation. Patrick Hallinan was named our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Patrick is a seasoned executive who has led global high-performing finance functions across top consumer brands. Patrick joins us in April from Fortune Brands Innovations, where he currently serves as their CFO, and is the ideal candidate for the next leader of our finance function.\nJohn Lucas joins us as our new CHRO and brings a highly distinguished track record with world-class experience in organizational and human capital management. John will be instrumental to enabling our culture and values and to the long-term success of our business. I want to thank Corbin Walburger and Deborah Wintner for their leadership and significant contributions during this critical transformation period for the company. I look forward to continuing to work with them as key Stanley Black & Decker leaders.\nTurning to our supply chain transformation. We have line of sight to deliver cumulative savings of $500 million by the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion by 2025. Building off the momentum from last quarter, we activated our transformation with a sense of urgency to optimize our operations, which better serve our customers while also being efficient and agile with our footprint and cost structure. After approving and initiating action on our SKU reductions, we now have approximately 50,000 SKUs that we are no longer manufacturing and are approved for decommission. Throughout 2023, we will work to transition our customers to the products that deliver the most value for our end users.\nAs we shared last quarter, the strategic sourcing team activated quick wins. We are pleased to share that this early traction has already generated $40 million in savings. Wave 1 is now fully activated and addresses approximately $2 billion of spend, which is covered by 20 RFPs that are due back this quarter. We also successfully advanced our facility optimization and distribution network planning. The detailed feasibility analysis nearing completion this quarter with execution of the plan to follow shortly thereafter.\nLastly, we have heightened our focus on manufacturing excellence, reemphasizing SBD Kaizen and Lean manufacturing practices at our factories. Activation at 4 plants will be complete this quarter. And in March, we will initiate the next wave. We have exited the acute phase of pandemic-driven supply constraints. And as such, refocusing our plans on continuous improvement rigor will enable the acceleration of value across the network. You can expect us to continue to take strides forward, and we will provide you with updates towards achieving our cumulative $1 billion of savings by the end of 2023 on our path to delivering total program savings of $2 billion by 2025.\nI will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter and full year performance as well as our 2023 guidance. Corbin?\n\nCorbin B. Walburger\n\nVP of Business Development & Interim CFO, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, fourth quarter revenues were in line with last year at $3.4 billion, benefiting from a 7% improvement from price actions and an 8-point contribution from the MTD and Excel Outdoor acquisitions. Both of these acquisitions are now a part of organic growth beginning in December. These factors were offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency. From a full year perspective, Tools & Outdoor achieved record revenue of $14.4 billion, driven by a 7% improvement from price actions and 21% growth contributed by our outdoor acquisitions, which was offset by softer consumer demand and currency.\nLooking at the regions, Latin America achieved 4% organic growth. Although Europe declined 3% organically, performance improved sequentially from the third quarter, and we believe the more significant impacts from U.K. channel destocking are now behind us. North America was down 7% as a result of lower consumer and DIY market demand as well as the third quarter carrying heavier holiday promotional shipments compared to last year. U.S. retail point of sale was supported by price increases and professional demand. Compared to a pre-COVID 2019 baseline, the fourth quarter POS growth was consistent with the growth levels experienced in the third quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of supply in these channels ended 1.5 weeks below 2019 levels.\nAdjusted operating margin for the segment was 1% in the quarter as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, planned production curtailments and lower volume. For the year, operating margin was 8.4%, down versus prior year.\nTurning to the strategic business units. For the full year, Power Tools declined 5% organically, due to weakness in consumer and DIY and front half constraints related to electronic components. These volume impacts were partially offset by the benefits of our price increases and the continued performance of our strong DEWALT cordless innovation across our FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME product families as well as our new and differentiated power stack battery packs. Hand tools declined 5% organically in the year.\nConsumer-related headwinds were partially offset by price realization as well as new product innovation, notably the DEWALT Impact Connect, which consists of accessories that attach to an impact driver, allowing up to 4x faster cutting than standard hand tools. We also benefited from innovation in storage solutions such as mobile tool storage within the DEWALT Tough system and the CRAFTSMAN Premium S2000 metal storage platform.\nThe Outdoor business declined 7% organically on a pro forma basis for 2022 due to the difficult outdoor season outlined earlier in the year. The fourth quarter marked the 1-year anniversary of the MTD and Excel acquisitions, and we're pleased with the progress made to advance the outdoor platform integration. We now have a combined dealer channel sales team and launched one go-to-market approach to grow share. We've activated a brand portfolio strategy, leveraging DEWALT, CUB CADET and HUSTLER in the Pro and high-end resi market segment while targeting CRAFTSMAN, Troy-Bilt, WOLF-Garten and Black&Decker for the residential end user. I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their dedication to this process and ongoing commitment to delivering the best products for our customers.\nNow shifting to Industrial, which had another strong quarter, recording 10% organic growth and double-digit adjusted operating margin. Segment revenue declined 1% versus last year as 9 points of price realization and 1 point of volume were offset by 5 points from currency and 6 points from the oil and gas divestiture. The team leveraged the price increases and volume growth to overcome commodity inflation and higher supply chain costs to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.5%, up sequentially 40 basis points and up 220 basis points versus last year.\nLooking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 9% in the quarter, led by aerospace growth of 37% and auto growth of 14%, which were partially offset by industrial markets. Aerospace fasteners delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement as the recovery in commercial OEM production continues. The auto fasteners' strong quarter, demonstrated by the businesses ability to gain share in a dynamic environment and outpaced global light vehicle production in the quarter and for the full year.\nAttachment Tools organic revenues were up 18%, driven by strategic pricing actions. While orders particularly from our dealer channel partners have been moderating, our backlog remains above 2019 levels. We continue to make progress with our inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, taking out nearly $500 million and resulting in a total second half inventory reduction of $775 million.\nOur production curtailment actions have been successful, helping to reduce DSI by approximately 20 days in the quarter, and it was good to see the significant inventory reduction in the second half translate into free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter.\nAs we look to the front half of 2023, we are targeting another $500 million reduction with the majority of this progress to be made in the second quarter. Although we typically see a seasonal inventory build as we prepare for the outdoor and spring selling season, we have the ability to work down our input materials and components as well as drive commercial actions to sell through finished goods. Our full year 2023 inventory reduction target is $750 million to $1 billion, which will drive significant cash flow generation that will be used to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. The timing of this reduction is demand-dependent. In a few moments, I'll cover how these assumptions impact the 2023 guidance range.\nTurning to gross margins. We expect the impact of planned production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations will continue to weigh on margins through the first half of 2023, resulting in margins in the low 20s. Production curtailments in the fourth quarter were down approximately 30% versus the long-term average and impacted gross margins by approximately 6 to 7 points in the quarter. In our base case, we expect to improve from these levels but not fully eased production curtailments until the third quarter of 2023, which should support a gross margin recovery into the mid- to high 20s in the back half. The normalized production and better gross margins could potentially shift earlier or later in the year depending on the overall demand environment and the speed of destocking. We have the teams focused on inventory reduction, cash generation and balance sheet health as we work to drive gross margins to our historical 35% plus target level in 2025.\nI'll now walk through how the company is planning for 3 demand scenarios for our 2023 guidance as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year. In this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low single digits with the first quarter being the toughest comp.\nTools & Outdoor total organic revenue inclusive of positive price is expected to be down low single digits, while Industrial is planned for low single-digit growth. Specifically, for Tools & Outdoor, this would imply a full year volume decline of approximately 5%, ahead of our forecast for the market. For the second half, volume is expected to be down 3% to 3.5%. In this base case, we would maintain our production curtailments with the goal of returning to normalized levels in the third quarter.\nAs a result, the under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain first half 2023 operating margins to low single digits. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin rate to improve to the mid- to high single-digit range. While our teams are aggressively focused on capturing deflation, this scenario does not include moderating commodity prices benefiting the P&L until late 2023 after the destock and can be a positive driver heading into 2024.\nAs we monitor the demand environment, we will be measured in the timing and magnitude of our investments, reinvesting into our businesses at the point of impact as part of our transformation strategy, and our base case scenario includes approximately $125 million of annualized reinvestment targeted at commercial leadership, driving innovation and complexity reduction.\nShifting to our second half acceleration scenario. This contemplates the possibility of a stronger demand environment supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. To support the improved second half demand, production levels would normalize towards the end of the second quarter. This scenario would position us to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half as well as an elevated level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation.\nLastly, we are preparing a downside case that reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. In this case, we expect full year organic revenues to decline by mid-single digits with volume declines in both the tools and outdoor and industrial segments. If this were to occur, our production curtailments would likely continue through the end of 2023, extending the time line of our gross margin recovery. Under this scenario, we would opt to conservatively meter the level of reinvestment until we had more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts and economic cycle.\nOverall, we feel it's prudent to consider this range of potential 2023 demand possibilities production and reinvestment levels as we continue to prioritize inventory reduction and cash generation. As such, we are guiding full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0 to $2. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be negative $1.65 to positive $0.85, inclusive of onetime charges from the global supply chain optimization and the remaining outdoor integration-related expenses. The current pretax estimate for onetime charges is approximately $225 million to $325 million with $50 million to $100 million in noncash charges.\nNow some added quarterly context from our base case. For the first quarter, we're expecting similar levels of operating profit to what we delivered in the fourth quarter. However, we do not expect the discrete tax benefits to repeat, resulting in our first quarter adjusted loss of $0.75 per share at the midpoint. We believe profitability can improve sequentially into the second quarter, resulting in a stronger performance.\nIn total, we expect our actions (inaudible) but will translate to positive first half free cash flow driven by $500 million of inventory reduction, most of which will come in the second quarter. As we get through the first half destock, we expect earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. We view this as a jumping off point to further improve with our transformation.\nOur guidance calls for $500 million to $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023, primarily from inventory reduction. We're focused on our key priorities: number one, generate strong cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; number two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and number three, focus on gaining market share in all major categories. We're planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market long-term organic growth.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Don.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Corbin. So in summary, we successfully advanced our cost reduction and business transformation strategy over the last quarter and made meaningful progress on a number of key objectives, including inventory reduction, cash generation, debt reduction and streamlining our organizational structure and supply chain. We have given you an indication today of what annualized EBITDA could be on the first step of this journey. We believe we can build from 2023 back half as our supply chain savings continue to accrue and contribute to the restoration of our gross margin to the 35% plus level.\nAs we look ahead, we aim to get our levels of EBITDA back to 2019 levels and beyond as we continue to transform our business. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and 2023 will clearly bring us challenges, we are prepared to navigate forward and believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you. ."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 third quarter webcast. On the webcast, in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO.\nOn our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from today's release, we made tangible progress during the third quarter towards our strategy around focusing our business and transforming our supply chain. We are building positive momentum as we deliver improved customer fill rates, deployed a new organizational structure, implemented cost controls and actively reduced our inventories.\nIn addition, we made significant progress reducing debt, utilizing $3.3 billion in proceeds from our strategic divestitures. All key priorities, we set out heading into the third quarter.\nAll of this is not yet apparent in the financials, but we are encouraged by a few items. One, our headcount reductions are largely complete. Two, inventory is coming down. Three, cash generation was positive in September, and we believe this can continue in the fourth quarter and next year. And four, gross margin will be the last to turn as we face the high cost of destocking, but we expect to be through that and pivot to better performance by the middle of next year.\nWhile the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, notably softer North America consumer and European markets, combined with stubborn cost inflation, there were relative bright spots with continued strength in professional construction and industrial customer demand as well as incremental progress unlocking global supply chain constraints. Our actions to alleviate semiconductor constraints are progressing as expected and are contributing to results through our improved fill rates as well as slightly better organic revenue performance in Q3.\nThird quarter revenue was $4.1 billion, up 9%, driven by our Outdoor Equipment acquisitions. Organic revenue declined 2%, which was an improvement over what we delivered in the first half, due to increased professional power tool supply and a solid performance by the Industrial business as organic growth was up 14%.\nPrice realization sequentially improved to 8% versus the prior year. U.S. retail point of sale was relatively consistent with the levels we saw exiting 2Q, supported by price and professional demand, even as softer DIY consumer demand persisted.\nEurope continues to operate in a challenging environment as a result of the broader macro, the war in the Ukraine as well as the continued impacts from customer destocking due to elevated channel inventories.\nOur improved supply position has set us up for strong merchandising support for the holidays across all major brands and categories, with much of the product already shipped to our customers in September and October. We have gained back some key aisle end caps and off-shelf promotion areas after 12 months of limited promotional activity.\nDuring the third quarter, we successfully delivered $65 million in pretax savings from our global cost initiatives and reduced our inventory by approximately $300 million. In a few moments, I will dive deeper into our progress related to the company's transformation plan announced in Q2.\nOperating margin was 6.2% in the third quarter pressured by input cost inflation, which was partially offset by customer price increases. Additionally, our margins were impacted from our inventory destock as we began the process of significantly reducing manufacturing production levels in June and during the third quarter. This resulted in third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.76.\nThe divestitures of Electronic Security, Access Technologies and Oil & Gas businesses were successfully completed in the third quarter, which further focuses Stanley Black & Decker's portfolio on our leading Tools & Outdoor and Industrial businesses. Proceeds from the transaction supported $3.3 billion of sequential debt reduction. These deals also conclude the strategic portfolio moves we've been executing over the last 12 months and further intensifies the operational execution focus of our company as we move forward.\nIn terms of financial guidance, because of the ongoing changes to the demand environment, the impact related to foreign exchange and incremental costs due to our more aggressive pullback on production to accelerate inventory destocking in the first half of 2023, we are revising our 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range down to $4.15 up to $4.65 and updating our free cash flow estimate to approximate $0.3 billion up to $0.6 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a substantial tax payment related to the gains on the business sales I previously mentioned.\nOur near-term priority is cash generation, and September marked a turning point with planned production curtailments beginning to meaningfully contribute to inventory reductions, supporting positive cash generation in the month. The decision to escalate and continue production curtailments in Q4 will clearly carry a negative P&L implication as we incur the impact of our underabsorption of fixed plant costs, while concurrently liquidating higher cost inventory from the balance sheet.\nAlthough the immediate P&L impacts are significant and will be incurred in Q4 and likely in the early stages of 2023, we believe proactively reducing inventory in a disciplined yet swift manner is the right strategy and will put our business in a position to optimize growth and margin expansion going forward.\nNow I'd like to review how we are moving forward to accelerate organic growth. We have optimized the corporate structure, focused our operating model and are transforming our supply chain to drive efficiency and fuel reinvestment. As we deploy our new organization structure and operating model, we are elevating 3 key priorities to sharpen our focus: one, end user obsession and innovation; two, customer focus; and three, delivering operational and functional excellence.\nThese are built upon the nonnegotiable priorities and values that make up our culture, such as people focus and talent management, health and safety, integrity, compliance, DE&I and ESG. In the next 3 years, we expect to redeploy $300 million to $500 million to advance innovation across our iconic brands, accelerate electrification in our Outdoor and Engineered Fastening businesses, rapidly accelerate our end-user market activation and create the supply chain of the future.\nThese investments will position the company for strong, sustainable, long-term growth, profitability, consistent free cash flow generation and shareholder return. We have a strong track record as the industry leader in breakthrough, world's first innovations in our businesses. From FLEXVOLT to ATOMIC and XTREME to POWERSTACK, we will build upon this strength to deliver an even higher quality of core and breakthrough innovations with shorter development cycles and new technologies.\nElectrification is a key growth driver across our Tools & Outdoor and Engineered Fastening businesses. We plan to make incremental investments to accelerate our efforts, capitalize on share gain opportunities and fortify our market leadership position as the technology continues to shift and adoption accelerates.\nMarket leadership includes more user activation at the front end of our businesses. As we introduce our new products and innovation, we will bring more digital tools and capabilities as well as additional commercial resources to engage directly with our customers, enhance interactions with our end users and drive market share gains.\nLastly, to fully leverage these investments, we need to have a world-class and more agile supply chain that brings us closer to our customers, increases our flexibility in response to demand and enhances our customer service levels, all to drive greater growth for us and for our customers.\nAligned with these growth investments and as we execute this strategy, we will be focused on a few key success criteria. One, our powerful innovation engine will position us to grow organic revenue 2 to 3x the market over the long term. Two, our supply chain transformation is a key enabler to improve our customer service levels and operational efficiency to return gross margins back to the 35% plus level with customer fill rates greater than 95%. Three, we have a long track record of generating strong free cash flow, and we'll continue to target 100% free cash flow conversion to net income over the long term while ensuring consistent annual performance.\nWe are now a more focused company, executing a clear strategy with both immediate and near-term tactical actions to deliver strong value for our shareholders over the long term. Key to our success is and will continue to be market-leading innovation, and I will now highlight a few exciting new launches on the next slide.\nAs the world's largest tool and outdoor company, we are continuing to push the bounds of our category offerings to serve the full spectrum of our makers and creators, from the DIY consumer to trade users and up to the most demanding pro. We are expanding DEWALT POWERSTACK with the launch of a new 5-amp hour battery. This is the most powerful, longest-lasting 20-volt MAX battery in its class and is compatible with our 300-tool strong DEWALT 20-volt system. POWERSTACK is the first pouch cell technology battery of its kind designed to deliver unparalleled power density to best serve our most demanding professional customers, and is expected to deliver over $100 million of revenue in its first 12 months since launch. Today, the 5-amp hour product is already in the European market and has received great reviews by our customers.\nWe're also continuing to advance our high-power DEWALT FLEXVOLT line. By the end of this year, the portfolio will reach 60 products across power tools and outdoor power equipment, generating approximately $500 million of annual revenue and continuing to grow, approaching nearly 70 products by the end of 2023. The DEWALT FLEXVOLT 15 Amp-hour battery was introduced last year as a world's first innovation. DEWALT FLEXVOLT converts users who are using corded, small-gas engine or pneumatic tools due to a high power need, and they convert them over to battery power. And it is one reason why 3/4 of the DEWALT power tool revenue is cordless today.\nOur FLEXVOLT technology is also advancing innovation and sustainability across our industrial business, where customers desire to replace existing hydraulic tools with cordless solutions to increase portability and efficiency. To that end, the Stanley infrastructure team recently launched the first cordless automatic rail maintenance tool, the RD60 rail drill, which is powered by DEWALT FLEXVOLT.\nThese are just a few subset of examples where we are continuing to deliver industry-leading innovations to push the bounds of our categories and accelerate our success.\nAnother key enabler to our strategy is generating cost savings by taking the complexity out of our businesses while investing to accelerate our organic growth, recovering gross margins and generating consistent strong free cash flow. From an SG&A perspective, we are executing on our plan to rapidly optimize our organizational structure to become flatter and more agile. The new structure is largely complete, including a leaner corporate team. These actions will generate the $300 million of annualized cost savings as targeted.\nRigor around indirect spend is in place. Initial savings of $40 million were realized in Q3, and we are on pace to deliver approximately $200 million by the end of next year. As we shared with many of you, we moved quickly to deploy this new structure, so the organization can focus on its priorities and execution. We remain on track to deliver the cumulative savings of $500 million we set out to achieve last quarter, covering the simplification of the corporate structure, the reduction of indirect spend and the streamlining of spans and layers, all by the end of 2023.\nPivoting to supply chain, we also activated this transformation with a sense of urgency. Detailed planning and, in some cases, project execution is underway across all 4 pillars of the strategy.\nI will now cover some noteworthy progress in the quarter. Regarding the SKU rationalization, we have approved and initiated action on approximately 50,000 SKUs, which represents roughly half of the targeted reduction. We expect the remaining SKU reductions to occur from now through the end of 2023.\nSecond, within the strategic sourcing initiatives, we are activating quick wins that are already generating savings. In tandem, we are defining the wave 1 implementation plan for 2023, which covers about 1/3 of the addressable spend.\nLastly, we are being thoughtful as we progress the facility consolidation and distribution optimization to ensure we plan effectively for successful execution with our teams and for our customers, even as we work with speed. We have completed the feasibility analysis and are now finalizing detailed planning, with implementation targeted to begin in 2023. Additionally, we expect to take initial actions to begin the optimization of our distribution network in the fourth quarter.\nWe have gained some significant early traction and are on pace to deliver the savings targeted for 2022, and we'll continue to build momentum as we enter 2023.\nI will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the third quarter performance, including gross margin and inventory levels as well as the latest guidance on how we expect to close out 2022.\n\nCorbin B. Walburger\n\nVP of Business Development & Interim CFO, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our third quarter business segment performance.\nBeginning with Tools & Outdoor, revenue grew 10% to $3.5 billion as the MTD and Excel outdoor acquisitions contributed nearly $600 million of revenue or approximately 18% growth, and price realization contributed 7%. These factors were partially offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency.\nOn an organic basis, we were down low single digits in emerging markets in North America and down 12% in Europe. U.S. retail point-of-sale was supported by professional demand and remained consistent with levels exiting the second quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of inventory in these channels remain below 2019 levels. The European results were impacted by retail market pressure due to high levels of customer inventory and inflation as recessionary concerns and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on consumer spending, particularly in the Northern region.\nAdjusted operating margin for the segment was 6.8%. Excluding charges and acquisitions, margin was 140 basis points better at 8.2%, however, still below the 15.5% level from the same period last year as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailment costs and lower volume. Consistent with normal seasonality, the MTD and Excel outdoor businesses deliver only about 40% of full year volume in the back half at operating margin, substantially below the annual average as margins in the first half of the year are typically bolstered by peak outdoor seasonal volume leverage.\nAcross the North American channels, organic sales in retail and e-commerce were down versus 2021 levels with moderate strength in Commercial and Industrial. However, as compared to a pre-pandemic 2019 baseline, organic sales performance was up double digits across these channels.\nTurning to the strategic business units within our Tools & Outdoor segment. Power Tools declined organically by 2%. This modest decline reflects an improvement versus the front half performance as we're seeing better semiconductor supply, which helped to raise customer fill rates and contributed to positive organic growth in North America. Looking ahead, we expect further progress in the fourth quarter and are serving a normalized merchandising and promotional schedule for our professional products with our customers.\nHand tools declined organically by 7%, driven by retail consumer demand softness in European customer destock. These factors were partially offset by strength among professional-oriented customers in the U.S. commercial and industrial channels as well as successful new product launches in our CRAFTSMAN plastic storage. The Outdoor business declined 12% on a pro forma organic basis. Total revenue was impacted by moderated consumer demand like many other discretionary retail categories and lower orders as our retailers are also working down inventory.\nThe outdoor team is progressing on our platform integration initiatives, and we have a host of new outdoor innovations across our brands and categories in the pipeline to be launched for the 2023 season.\nNow shifting to Industrial, which had a great quarter, leveraging the cyclical recovery with 14% organic growth and margin expansion back to the double digits. Segment revenue increased 5% versus last year as 9 points of price realization, coupled with 5 points of volume, were partially offset by 6 points from currency headwinds and 3 points from the Oil & Gas divestiture, which closed in August. The team leveraged this growth and our price increases to overcome commodity inflation and deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, up sequentially 180 basis points and up 340 basis points versus last year.\nLooking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 15%, led by aerospace growth of 28%, auto growth of 22% and 4% growth in general industrial fasteners. The auto fasteners business continues to navigate a dynamic supply environment for our customers and is also leveraging tailwinds related to the recovery in auto manufacturing. Our industrial fastener business is continuing to outperform the industrial production index and is maintaining a healthy backlog, which is up 7% versus last year.\nAerospace fasteners delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business continues to focus on capturing the emerging recoveries in both narrow-body and wide-body OEM production.\nInfrastructure organic revenues were up 12%, driven by 19% growth in attachment tools, which was partially offset by the Oil & Gas divestiture in the latter half of the quarter. Orders from our dealer channel partners are beginning to slow, yet our backlog remains robust and year-to-date OEM orders are up versus last year.\nI'll now spend a few moments covering our gross margin and inventory performance and expectations. Third quarter gross margins continued to be pressured by several points as we navigated the impacts from inflation and temporary impacts from under-absorption of fixed costs related to our planned production curtailments. This is a strategic choice as we prioritize cash flow generation through inventory reductions. We're making progress with our inventory reductions, which totaled nearly $300 million in the third quarter. We expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter, which will translate into positive cash flow. While these curtailments put temporary pressure on our margins, they are necessary as we get our days of inventory back closer to historical levels.\nWith this goal in mind, we made the strategic choice to extend our planned production curtailments versus our original plan to ensure we make continued progress through the middle of next year. Back in July, we assumed our production levels will begin to normalize at year-end. However, we're now planning to maintain low production levels through the first quarter of 2023. This puts additional pressure on our gross margins and depresses payables for the near term, with the trade-off and capturing a cash generation opportunity as inventory continues to decline. These items also impact our total cash generation forecast for 2022 as we incorporate assumptions for lower working capital reductions, including the previously mentioned impact of payables and a lower earnings base.\nHowever, the cash flow generation for the company is gaining momentum. We generated positive free cash flow in the month of September, and we believe this will continue for the fourth quarter. Our capital deployment priority is debt reduction as we look to get to our targeted 2x debt-to-EBITDA level. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $3.3 billion, utilizing the cash from our divestitures. We expect to achieve further reductions to our debt levels as we generate cash flow in the fourth quarter and in 2023.\nTurning to gross margins. We believe that this quarter and the first quarter of 2023 should represent the trough as production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations are most impactful over the next 6 months, pressuring margins to the low 20s. The destock impact is expected to alleviate beginning in the second quarter of 2023, with gross margins recovering into the high 20s before any of the benefits from our supply chain transformation.\nAs you heard from Don, we expect that the supply chain transformation savings will start to accrue as we move through the year and build to approximately $500 million by the end of 2023, which will provide further support for the improved gross margins into the 30s on the journey towards 35% plus gross margins in 2025. We believe our focus on inventory reduction, cash generation and balance sheet health are prudent as we work in parallel on structural supply chain savings to improve our gross margins in 2023 and beyond.\nI'll now walk through what this means for our 2022 guidance. For full year 2022, we expect low double-digit total revenue growth for the company. We're updating our adjusted earnings per share full year guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.65. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $0.10 to $0.80, inclusive of onetime charges. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $755 million to $795 million.\nOn the right side of the slide, we've outlined the key assumption changes to our adjusted EPS versus our prior estimate. Lower fourth quarter revenue, primarily driven by European retail market pressure due to high levels of customer inventory and inflation, reduces EPS by $0.30. Foreign currency translation pressure further reduces EPS by $0.23. Our strategic choice to prioritize inventory reduction and free cash flow generation is accompanied by higher production curtailment costs and inventory destocking costs, which are estimated to be $0.82 of a reduction. Then the 2022 tax impact from lower earnings is expected to increase EPS by $0.25, bringing the revised midpoint to $4.40.\nWe're continuing to expect $150 million to $200 million of gross savings to be achieved in 2022 from our transformation programs, of which $65 million was realized in the third quarter. We have also disclosed other below-the-line planning items for modeling purposes on the slide.\nTurning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor is expected to realize a mid- to high single-digit organic revenue decline. Margins continue to be down versus prior year as a result of inflation, acquisition mix and volume deleverage. We are continuing to focus on the outdoor acquisition synergy realization as a lever to improve margins within this business unit over the coming years.\nThe Industrial segment organic revenue growth expectation remains unchanged at high single to low double digits. The industrial margin rate is expected to continue to improve sequentially. However, it will be pressured year-over-year largely due to inflation and mix.\nTurning to cash flow. The fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to approximate $300 million to $600 million, which will support our strong commitment and track record for returning value to our shareholders via cash dividends as well as further debt reduction. As we look into 2023, we've positioned the company with $1 billion of annualized cost savings, which Don covered earlier. We're also aggressively working to capture the opportunities of recent spot market pullbacks on many of our commodities, such as metals and resins, transportation as well as others. These input savings could benefit us next year after our planned destocking. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions, which are in our control, to position the company to navigate a variety of demand environments and contribute to gross margin accretion. Once our visibility improves, we will also invest for share gain by advancing our innovation, electrification and end-user activation.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Don to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Corbin. So in summary, a lot of progress was made in our first 90 days, and these benefits will become even more apparent within the financials in the coming quarters.\nOur headcount reductions are largely complete. Inventory is now coming down. Cash generation was positive in September, and we believe this will continue in the fourth quarter and next year. Gross margin will be the last to turn as we face the high cost of destocking, but we expect to be through that and pivot to better performance by the middle of next year. And we will continue to focus on debt reduction, further strengthening the balance sheet, all as we continue our commitment to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends.\nAs we move forward, we have a clear strategy, vision and execution plan. And we are laser-focused on optimizing what is within our control. The macroeconomic environment will definitely continue to be choppy, and 2023 will clearly bring new challenges. However, we believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 second quarter webcast. On the webcast, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.\nThis morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we will be sticking with just one question per caller.\nAnd as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from this morning's results, we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, including inflation, rising interest rates; and now late in the quarter, we started to see these factors impact retail customer demand across our global tools and outdoor markets. The significantly slower demand trends in June, combined with a very late start to the outdoor season due to weather, resulted in significant volume pressure versus expectations, and revenue landed well below our plan.\nIn response to the sudden shift in demand, we have taken immediate corrective cost actions, which are already in progress. We are now expecting demand to normalize closer to 2019 levels for the remainder of 2022. The organization is focused on taking the necessary steps to reduce inventory, generate cash flow and resize our cost base through corporate simplification, organizational optimization and supply chain transformation.\nWe will provide more detail on these areas later in our presentation, but we expect these initiatives can deliver pretax savings of $1 billion as well as a significant reduction in inventory beginning in the second half of 2022 and through the end of 2023.\nOver the last 9 months, we've executed a number of acquisitions and divestitures that have successfully focused our company around our market-leading Tools & Outdoor businesses as well as our strongly positioned Industrial products business. As you saw last week, our Security and Access Technology transaction successfully closed, and we are using the $3.5 billion in cash, gross cash proceeds net of tax to fund the $2.3 billion share repurchase from earlier this year as well as to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce debt levels in the third quarter. We also expect our Oil & Gas divestiture to close within the third quarter. These transactions enable us to intensify our focus on operational efficiency within our remaining now simplified business portfolio.\nWe also must continue to advance our strong innovation agenda, pursue a faster path of electrification in outdoor and engineered fastening, while we drive further global market penetration along the way. We are redirecting resources within our Tools & Outdoor businesses to ensure we are extremely well positioned for strong, long-term growth, profitability expansion, consistent annual cash flow and improved shareholder returns.\nIncorporating the changes from this new demand environment as well as factoring in the impact of our cost reduction plan caused us to revise our 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range down to $5 up to $6 and to update our free cash flow estimate to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the second half of '22. This free cash flow range excludes the tax payments associated with our Security divestitures.\nTo summarize our second quarter, revenues were $4.4 billion, up 16%, driven by our outdoor equipment acquisition. Organic revenue was down 6%, which was impacted by slower Tools & Outdoor demand trends across many of our global markets due to poor weather start to the outdoor season and reduced consumer spending. Price realization contributed 7%, which accelerated sequentially from the first quarter.\nOur total company operating margin was 9.2%, benefiting from the contribution of our pricing actions but was down versus prior year due to lower volume, cost inflation and supply chain logistic cost increases. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.77. More from Corbin on Q2 and 2022 guidance a bit later.\nAs I previously mentioned, we saw a swift deterioration in consumer tools and outdoor demand. This was in contrast to professional tool demand and the professional outdoor independent channel, which remained healthy and continue to be active opportunities. During this time frame, the consumer faced price increases across many categories, including essentials like food and energy. Consequently, our consumer categories have started to become impacted. We have seen this phenomenon across many of our global markets as central banks tighten the money supply to control high inflation.\nThe chart on the left illustrates our Tools U.S. POS trends against a 2019 base. Late in the quarter, it became clear that the point-of-sale trends were settling into a much lower growth position. And with information we have now, we believe it's prudent to build this into our plan for the back half. Price in a strong professional market delivered total dollar growth off the 2019 baseline. However, volumes turned negative versus 2019 in the later part of the quarter or specifically in the month of June. We have analyzed the trends and the pricing in the market and do not see retail price gaps versus competition. This, coupled with our information at the category and retailer level leads us to conclude that our markets are softening.\nOutdoor power equipment also experienced slowing demand during the month of June. Customer inventory levels are elevated, largely driven by a very slow start to the season due to poor weather, which clearly is impacting replenishment demand across the retail outdoor power equipment industry. The poor consumer outdoor season is a well-known fact in the industry initially due to poor weather start and then declining consumer spending due to inflationary pressures previously discussed.\nHowever, there are a couple of significant positive factors to consider in this difficult demand environment. One, we will be past the constraints on semiconductor supply in the third quarter, and other inputs have greatly improved as well. Therefore, we are expecting better fill rates in the back half to capitalize on the continued strength we're seeing for professional end-user-driven demand in tools and outdoor.\nAnd two, the tools inventories at many of our major customers in North America are below 2019 levels, which should limit our destocking risk to customers in certain other geographies, such as Europe and as well as the U.S. outdoor retail category I mentioned. Across our industrial businesses, backlogs remain strong and demand for aerospace fasteners is steadily climbing as the recovery in narrow-body production has begun. The auto recovery continues to be choppy, but we do see some improvement and continue to outperform light vehicle production levels as demand of electric vehicles remains well above supply and OEMs continue to pursue strategic long-term transformation to EV-centric portfolios.\nIn summary, we see a demand environment that is modestly higher than 2019 levels, and therefore, we are implementing an aggressive cost and inventory response to this new environment while also pivoting the company to a new strategy for long-term success. We continue to have conviction in the long-term outlook of the markets we serve around construction, repair and remodel, outdoor and across the industrial sector. With the housing inventory at historical lows and relative strength in the industrial markets we serve, our businesses are squarely positioned to satisfy our customer demands after we navigate the current environment.\nThe portfolio transformation that we have orchestrated over the past 9 years is coming to conclusion, and we are setting up our core businesses to emerge even stronger on the other side of demand disruption. As we look ahead, Stanley Black & Decker is at an important point of inflection in our vision and strategy. We must ensure our customers and end users and their needs are where our energy and resources are fully focused. Our plan is to rapidly optimize our organizational structure to support our simplified company. We will take the complexity out of our businesses and the decision-making processes. Then we will invest to accelerate growth to enable us to grow organically 2 to 3x the market.\nThe operating environment clearly has dramatically changed in the last month, especially as we really evolved into the last stages of the quarter or June. Since accepting my current role, the leadership team and I have accelerated and intensified the organization and operational streamlining efforts. We are rallying the teams around a more focused portfolio and providing the businesses with the resources closer to the point of impact.\nOur Tools, Outdoor, Industrial businesses are high-quality assets today, and we have the opportunity to improve them further through faster organic growth and significant operational enhancements to improve our margins. As we think about our leading franchises, the key areas of focus will be innovation, electrification, market leadership and supply chain transformation, with always keeping the customer and end user needs in our sights.\nFirst, we are reimagining Tools & Outdoor innovation to create shorter innovation cycles and new technologies, so we can provide differentiated competitive offerings with speed to market. This includes introducing a high quality of new margin-accretive core innovations to the portfolio in addition to more big swing innovations that carry the same disruptive power of our successful franchise extensions such as FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC, XTREME and POWERSTACK.\nSecondly, we are taking meaningful action to deliver innovation and electrification with power tools and outdoor power equipment as well as capitalizing on our partnerships with auto OEMs to leverage our highly engineered auto fastening solutions, the electric vehicle market as it rapidly expands. These are big opportunities for growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. We are accelerating our efforts in these areas as these trends are moving quickly, and we must maintain our market leadership position during this technology shift.\nNext, we will step up our commercial support, bringing more digital tools to our commercial model and increasing sales leadership to directly engage with our customers and end users. These resources drive share gain and key information from our end users related to our products and potential new innovations. In addition, we will enhance our efforts in digital marketing around new innovation launches, promotions and other key end user interactions.\nFinally, to enable this growth, we need to accelerate our supply chain transformation. One of many lessons from the pandemic is that complex and long supply chains are prone to disruption and in our specific case, are not matched well with the short-cycle nature of our businesses. So you have a choice: maintain very high levels of inventory due to the long supply chain or have your supply chain closer to your customers, elevate your agility and resiliency to better serve those customers. We believe being closer to the customer is the right answer.\nOrganizationally, we are working to ensure that I have the right people in the right roles to execute this vision. We have an accomplished leadership team supported by a diverse, extremely capable organization, which is comprised of Stanley Black & Decker veterans and supplemented by new talent with fresh perspectives and industry expertise. We continue to bring in new members of our leadership team to partner with our existing seasoned leaders. A few examples of this are: Robert Raff and John Wyatt are leading our Tool & Outdoor businesses; and Tamer Abuaita, sorry, Tamer, who joined us as our Chief Supply Chain Officer in January.\nI am excited to see Robert rejoin the Tools business to lead the team with fresh energy and insight. He's a veteran Tool executive who also led our Security business transformation. He knows the business, the team and our customers and will bring that perspective as he gets the Tool organization focused on our shared vision.\nTamer brings nearly 30 years of experience leading global transformations, expansions and post-acquisition integrations of supply chains for multibillion-dollar consumer goods organizations. He is ideally suited to lead the transformation of our supply chain.\nAll of these growth and supply chain investments are necessary to support higher growth and share gains with our target objective being 2 to 3x the market growth.\nNow let's get tactical. Let me describe our global cost reduction program, which has a savings potential of $150 million to $200 million in 2022, growing to $1 billion by the end of next year and totaling $2 billion within 3 years. These actions are necessary as we successfully navigate the current market environment but importantly, when the time is right, will give us the ability to further accelerate investment in the commercial programs I just outlined. Over the past 2 months, we have applied rigorous prioritization to eliminate and reduce overlapping capabilities and functions.\nAs a more straightforward company, we don't need the same structure that was set up for a diversified industrial model. The corporate simplification is nearing completion, and it will generate $200 million of annualized savings. The resizing effort allows us to ensure our resources serve our core businesses and are closer to the point of impact with the customer and in our supply chain. As a result of these initiatives, we expect the 2023 corporate spending level will be below the 2019 spend.\nTo help us navigate today's economic crosscurrents and in the spirit of simplification, we are also attacking indirect spend. We are prioritizing across all categories and cost centers to requalify what we will continue in the near term. We expect this exercise to generate an additional $200 million of annualized savings.\nNext, we have an opportunity to improve the speed and agility of our operating and decision-making processes. We are doing this by reducing the complexity of how we are operating as an organization, including evaluating the number of layers in our structure from the C suite to the point of impact. To put this in perspective, we believe we can move from our current organizational structure, which has 12 layers, down closer to 7 to 8 layers. I believe that we function much better as a company when our leaders can come together quickly for prioritization and decision-making and results in us moving forward in a more agile manner.\nAdditionally, as we have gone deeper into our outdoor integration, we see opportunities for savings where there are synergies with our tools business. We are implementing the spans and layers and cost synergy exercises during Q3 and expect this effort to deliver an additional $100 million in annual savings.\nLastly, we are accelerating our supply chain transformation. We believe there is approximately $1.5 billion of P&L efficiencies that can be gained by this acceleration over the next 3 years with $500 million by the end of 2023. I will go into more detail on this value stream in just a moment. So to summarize, we believe this program can deliver cost savings of $150 million to $200 million in 2022, $1 billion by the end of 2023 and $2 billion within 3 years.\nI will now dive a little bit deeper into the supply chain transformation, which is the largest driver of this global cost plan, particularly in the medium term. As mentioned, we are embarking on a 3-year journey that will completely reshape our supply chain. We will be focused on accelerating our Make Where We Sell strategy to be closer to our customers and more responsive to demand.\nOur supply chain needs to be agile and adaptive with new product innovation. And therefore, as we ramp up our investments in innovation and expand the quantity of our new products we bring to market annually, we also need a supply chain that significantly reduces our innovation cycle time to launch new products much faster than today. This transformation is a key pillar of our strategy and a catalyst for returning our gross margins to 35% plus level. Our success with this transformation will build a more sustainable, agile and efficient supply chain that is resilient in an ever-changing and dynamic operating environment and further enable our advanced manufacturing technologies.\nWe'll be focused around 4 value streams. First, product platforming shifts our optimization focus from cost to supply by leveraging product families designed around common building blocks. This shift enables us to standardize our components through platform solutions that create economies of scale with our key suppliers, which ultimately reduces the complexity in our product design and supply base. It also reduces time to market on innovation by leveraging common design. We also believe we can reduce the number of SKUs in our system by 40% plus. These programs collectively can deliver cost savings of approximately $300 million.\nThe next significant opportunity is strategic sourcing, which has a savings potential of $500 million. As we look to set up our supply base through our Make Where We Sell strategy, we have an opportunity to deepen our relationships with suppliers and help them optimize supply and efficiency. In addition, we have significant opportunities to leverage contract manufacturing in parts of our supply chain that can improve cost and speed to market. Finally, our simplification efforts within our first value stream, product platforming, also carries benefits here as we have less unique parts in sourcing complexity, which results in higher scale purchases.\nOur current supply chain is a result of organic growth and additions through acquisitions. And while it has been optimized over the years, there is significant opportunity to reduce complexity, eliminate logistical inefficiencies, increase scale for our manufacturing and serve our customers better.\nCurrently, we have approximately 120 manufacturing facilities in our network. As we think about our supply chain in the future, we want to be closer to our customer and we want to do it at a lower cost. This means we need to simplify and consolidate our regional footprints around high-performing industry [core auto] technology-enabled sites. Our target is to reduce our operating footprint by at least 30% and optimize our distribution network, which can generate approximately $300 million in savings.\nLastly, we see an opportunity to capture $400 million through operational excellence. This is focused on driving incremental efficiencies across our facilities, leveraging the SBD operating model, having the right levels of inventory and streamlining the spans and layers within our operations organization to align around our core businesses.\nThese value streams total approximately $1.5 billion of our -- over 3 years with an opportunity for $500 million during the first 18 months of the program. Clearly, this represents a significant value creation opportunity. However, it also creates an opportunity to elevate the focus on our customers and end user needs.\nCorbin will now take you through more detailed commentary on the second quarter results as well as what we believe this near-term demand environment means for the remainder of the year. Corbin?\n\nCorbin B. Walburger\n\nVP of Business Development & Interim CFO, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our second quarter business results. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, revenue grew 17% as the MTD and Excel acquisitions contributed $900 million of revenue and price realization contributed 7%, accelerating approximately 1.5 points sequentially as a result of our third round of global price increases implemented in May. These factors were partially offset by a 16% decline in volume and a negative 2% impact from currency, which both softened as we moved through the quarter, as interest rates increased and inflation in nondiscretionary categories like gas and fuel hit consumers' wallets.\nAs a result, U.S. retail point-of-sale demand softened during May and June. That said, our professional customer channels and products remain solid and outperformed our consumer-oriented offerings. On an organic basis, regional performances were flat in the emerging markets, down 10% in Europe and down 11% in North America.\nOperating margin for the segment was 10.8%. Excluding acquisitions, margin was 1 point better at 11.8%, however, still below the 19.9% level from the same period last year as the benefit from our price actions was more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs and lower volume. Across channels, sales were down versus 2021 levels. However, against the pre-pandemic 2019 baseline, retail was up mid-single digits, and commercial and industrial was up low double digits.\nTurning to the Tools & Outdoor SBUs. Power tools and hand tools declined organically by 6% and 8%, respectively, driven by the softening of retail demand and against a very strong period in the prior year. Operationally, the teams have been successful in alleviating our semiconductor supply constraints and are beginning to see semiconductor-driven fill rate improvements for the previously constrained products. The fill rates are on a path to return to targeted levels in the third quarter.\nAs we look forward, our investments in innovation, electrification and commercial resources will support the launch of new product introductions expected in the back half and into 2023. We're launching a series of new DEWALT cordless solutions continuing to electrify the professional job site. As we convert current product categories still relying largely on corded and gas-powered products to next-generation battery-powered tools, we will also pair these new products with the DEWALT POWERSTACK, our industry-leading battery technology that launched only 7 months ago.\nComing later this year is the world's first innovation, the new DEWALT Impact Connect, which consists of new accessories that attach to an Impact driver and will allow end users to effortlessly cut copper and PVC pipe up to 4x faster than standard hand tools. We'll also launch new category solutions for the trade users with our Craftsman and Stanley brands, expanding these 20-volt systems to more than 100 products by early 2023.\nAs we have throughout our history, we remain committed to serving the ongoing performance needs of the most demanding pro and trade users of the DEWALT, Stanley and Craftsman solutions. The Outdoor business declined 8% on a pro forma organic basis. This decline was driven by a very slow start to the season due to poor weather as well as softening consumer demand similar to many other discretionary retail categories. Due to the softer demand, our retailers are working down inventory and have eased replenishment at this point. Despite this season being slower than 2021, pro forma sales are still favorable as compared to 2019 levels, primarily driven by the secular gains we have experienced from electrification, which remains our focus going forward.\nThe Outdoor team continues to advance our platform integration efforts, and we're excited about the innovation, growth and synergy opportunities ahead. Stay tuned for the exciting launch of a host of new outdoor offerings, including innovations in handheld, walk-behind and ride-on equipment for the 2023 season.\nNow shifting to Industrial. Segment revenue increased 8% versus last year as 8 points of price realization, coupled with 4 points of volume were partially offset by about a 4-point negative impact from currency. Operating margin was 9.3%, which compares to 10.5% in the second quarter of last year as the benefit of price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation.\nLooking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 7% as 7% general industrial fastener growth was accompanied by 4% growth in the auto fastener business, along with an acceleration for aerospace fasteners, which was up 36%. The auto fastener business continues to successfully operate in a dynamic environment and outpaced light vehicle production by 5 points.\nOur industrial fastener business has a healthy backlog, which is up 18% versus last year. Aerospace fasteners delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business is focused on capturing the recovery in OEM production, which is underway.\nInfrastructure organic revenues were up 26%, driven by 17% growth in attachment tools. Infrastructure backlog remained strong, up 44% versus last year, and the team continues to partner with suppliers to successfully fill booked orders.\nMoving on to our aggressive plan to reduce inventory to generate strong cash flow in the second half. Our second quarter ending inventory balance was $6.6 billion, up approximately $400 million versus the first quarter and up versus historical levels of stock.\nThe main factors contributing to the increase versus prior years were an elevated level of in-process inventory as a result of the congested global supply chain, along with higher inflation, finished goods above current demand requirements and approximately $1 billion of additional inventory from the outdoor acquisitions.\nWe are implementing actions to significantly reduce working capital by $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022, primarily from inventory reductions. There are 5 parallel work streams already underway to enact a sequential inventory decline with a sense of urgency: First, production curtailments to slow finished goods manufacturing have already started; second, commercial teams are working on expediting sell-through of on-hand finished goods; third, safety stock levels are being reviewed and optimized; fourth, goods in transit are being actively addressed as we work to reduce lead times and slow production; and lastly, levels of raw material and WIP are being evaluated to meet current production requirements. This inventory reduction plan has P&L cost implications for the next few quarters but is necessary to realign our inventory to the current demand environment and meet our cash generation requirements.\nLet's transition to the next slide, where I'll speak further about gross margin. Total company adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 28%, down 2 points from the prior 2 quarters and against the 36% we had in the prior year. The confluence of the elongated supply chain, inflation and easing consumer demand impacted gross margins, partially offset by the implementation of price increases.\nOver the last 12 months, we've been responding to inflation with multiple rounds of price increases, which is reflected in our price performance over the last few quarters. At this stage, given the slowing demand environment and moderating spot commodity rates, we're targeting surgical opportunities for price as opposed to additional broad-based global price increases.\nThe cumulative impacts of rising inflation and global supply chain costs and inefficiencies are now capitalized in inventory. While we believe we can optimize moving forward, these capitalized costs will be with us until our inventory returns to normalized levels.\nIn addition, there will be costs associated with plants running at curtailed levels while we destock. We expect the cost dynamic of this inventory normalization process to take 3 to 4 quarters with gross margins sequentially improving as we move into and through the first half of 2023. These are short-term but necessary impacts as we prioritize cash flow in this environment. To quantify this opportunity, we see 300 basis points of improvement potential once the destocking is complete.\nWe're clearly not satisfied with 30% gross margins and have begun implementing the following actions to accelerate the pace and increase the magnitude of this improvement. First, we're immediately attacking the fixed and semi-fixed costs across our manufacturing base, capturing the quick wins from the first phase of our supply chain transformation. Second, spot commodity prices have moderated from the peak levels in April. While this will take until 2023 to work its way into the P&L, we plan to aggressively go after savings to capture this opportunity.\nIn total, these 2 actions can accelerate the pace of margin improvement and enable us to achieve low 30s gross margins in the back half of next year. Our 3-year target is to get our gross margins back to 35% plus, and the $1.5 billion supply chain transformation that Don discussed is how we do it. So to summarize, prioritizing cash generation is the right decision for the company by curtailing our production plans and lowering our inventories to set ourselves up for a stronger 2023 and beyond.\nNow let me pull all this together into what it means for 2022 guidance. We're expecting total revenue growth to be in the low double digits. We're updating our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5 to $6. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $0.80 to $2.05, inclusive of onetime charges related to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russian business closure and integration-related costs.\nThe current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $760 million to $810 million. The change in pretax charges from April guidance primarily relate to a roughly $170 million noncash asset impairment charge related to the Oil & Gas divestiture and an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in restructuring to support our cost reduction plans.\nOn the right side of the slide, we've outlined the components of our adjusted EPS assumptions versus our prior estimate. The slowing consumer demand in Tools & Outdoor, along with moderated price expectations, contributes to lower revenues and reduces EPS by $4.25. Currency translation, below-the-line items and second quarter performance impact EPS by another $0.55. We expect the plant production curtailments to range from $0.50 to $0.70 of a reduction as we minimize fixed and semi-fixed cost during this period but do not completely avoid them. Then the 2022 benefit from the cost savings initiatives that we previously described adds $0.80 to $1.\nI want to spend a moment to recap the drivers of our cost savings plan. Simplifying the corporate structure, reducing indirect spend, optimizing organizational spans and layers and streamlining the operational footprint are expected to total $100 million to $200 million in savings over the remainder of 2022 with cumulative savings of $1 billion by the end of 2023. We've also disclosed other below-the-line planning items for modeling purposes on the slide.\nTurning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to decline mid- to high single digits with margins down on a year-over-year basis. Pricing is expected to contribute high single-digit growth for the back half and full year. We believe there is a meaningful mid-term opportunity to improve margins within the Outdoor acquisitions over the coming years, and this continues to be a significant priority for us. We expect high single-digit margins this year, and we see the potential for low double-digit margins over the coming years.\nWe're targeting the Industrial segment to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit organic growth, driven by innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across much of the portfolio. The industrial margin rate is expected to be pressured year-over-year largely due to inflation and mix. We're closely following the recoveries in auto and aerospace and still believe there to be a solid growth outlook in those markets.\nShifting more specifically to the third quarter. We expect adjusted EPS will approximate 13% of the full year. This is comprised of relatively flat sequential tool sales, a slight sequential improvement for Industrial and a seasonally lighter Outdoor quarter as compared to the first half of the year.\nNow turning to cash flow. Second half free cash flow, excluding the tax payments from the Security sale, is expected to approximate $1 billion to $1.5 billion, supported by our inventory and cost optimization actions. The divestiture-related tax payment is expected to approximate $500 million to $600 million; and therefore, total free cash flow is expected to be $400 million to $1 billion in the second half.\nStanley Black & Decker remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, and our current priority for excess capital deployment will be debt repayment to support our strong investment-grade credit ratings and our commitment to the continued return of value to our shareholders as reflected by the recently announced 55th consecutive annual dividend increase. After we strengthen the balance sheet and the macro improves, our plan for excess capital is to prioritize our share repurchase program. And I'm sure many of you are thinking about what the normalized earnings power is for the company. It will take until the first half of next year to work through our inventory destocking plans and fully implement and realize the benefits from our cost reduction actions. We believe the initiatives we've outlined today are sufficient to return to our 2019 earnings power on an annualized basis once we hit the second half of next year. This does not assume any improvements to revenue.\nHere's how you get there. We believe destocking is a 3- to 4-quarter process that will improve our gross margins by approximately 3 points as we move into and through the front half of next year. Then the annualized benefit of our prioritization, complexity reduction efforts and impact from our indirect spend reductions are worth approximately $500 million by the end of 2023.\nFinally, the supply chain transformation can add another 2 to 3 points to gross margins as those savings are realized. These are all items within our control, and if we were to achieve them at a faster pace or realize improvements from revenue or input pricing, we will be prepared to accelerate investment in our core businesses and capitalize on the growth opportunities that Don outlined.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Don to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Don?\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Corbin. There's no doubt we are operating in one of the most challenging environments in recent history, which underscores the need to accelerate our strategic transformation that will carry the benefits of increasing agility and improving our responsiveness to customer demand. Our portfolio transformation comes at an ideal time as it enables us to unlock significant value by rapidly pivoting the organizational structure and operating plan towards a more focused company centered around great franchises within our Tools & Outdoor and Industrial businesses.\nWe have an aggressive cost program that we expect will yield $1 billion of savings by the end of next year and approaching a cumulative savings of $2 billion within 3 years. This will allow us to accelerate investments in our core businesses as the demand environment clears. As we look forward, we have a clear vision, and we believe these actions will reshape our organization and elevate our focus on our customer and end user needs, enabling us to deliver strong shareholder value through long-term growth and enhanced profitability.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThanks, Don. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you."

Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. As such, statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.\n\nJames M. Loree\n\nCEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from this morning's results, we achieved 20% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of sequential gross margin improvement in the first quarter. We benefited from a sustained strong demand environment, significant and growing price realization and our new strategic outdoor acquisitions.\nThe first quarter results illustrate the operational focus and agility of our teams in managing through a choppy external environment characterized by supportive demand. We are executing pricing to offset inflation and restore margins and beginning a very successful integration process with the new outdoor acquisitions. We will benefit from recent portfolio moves, which render a more focused company, anchored by our core tools, outdoor and industrial franchises.\nIn this regard, we announced last Friday the sale of our Access Technologies business for $900 million in an all-cash transaction at a compelling valuation. It represents the final step in our security divestiture initiative and was preceded by the announced sale of our Electronic Security business to Securitas in the fourth quarter for $3.2 billion. These transactions, along with the outdoor acquisitions, will further strengthen our position as the #1 tools and outdoor company in the world.\nWith these acquisitions and the security divestitures, we have created a business portfolio that is extremely well positioned for sustained long-term growth and margin expansion as well as one that benefits from several positive secular trends and competitive advantages.\nDuring the quarter, we also initiated $2.3 billion in share repurchases through an accelerated share repurchase as well as open market buyback activity. These actions represent significant progress towards achieving our goal of returning $4 billion in capital to our shareholders through repurchases, which we expect to complete in '23.\nTaking into account the approximately $0.5 billion in dividends we expect to pay in 2022, we will have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders by the end of the year, a record for Stanley Black & Decker. These important capital allocation actions along with, one, our now demonstrated and continuing ability to achieve substantial price inflation recovery; and two, progress in reducing supply chain constraints will result in higher growth and margin accretion and thus, significant value creation in both the short and long term.\nTo summarize our first quarter, revenues were $4.4 billion, up 20% driven by our outdoor equipment acquisitions. Organic revenue was down 1%, and customer demand remained strong across many of our global markets and price realization accelerated sequentially from the fourth quarter. The volume could have been higher, but for the supply-constrained environment that we continue to make progress on resolving, with added supply of semiconductors and electronic components during this quarter, we expect to be able to alleviate all major electronics-related constraints by the end of the quarter.\nOur total company operating margin was 11.5%, up 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting the implementation of new pricing actions, but down versus prior year due to cost inflation and supply chain challenges. This resulted in first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.10, which was ahead of our plan.\nAs we look forward, I'd like to share a few comments on what we're seeing in the demand environment. In Tools & Outdoor, end-user demand across most markets and channels has remained stable, led by pro construction. Absolute dollar sell-through in North America retail continues at high levels, especially when measured sequentially and/or compared with the 2019 baseline. Additionally, we believe that we are gaining market share in North America and other geographies. For instance, based on publicly available disclosures by our top 2 home center customers, our 2021 point-of-sale growth was above category line average for each of them.\nIn our end markets today, while the boom global conditions of 2020 and 2021 have leveled off, the fundamentals and secular drivers remain healthy and are still very much intact. As we look out over the balance of the year, the combination of repair/remodel, new residential construction and commercial construction have plenty of runway to continue to drive enduring demand in many of our markets around the world.\nDespite this factor of slowing global growth and increasing U.S. interest rates, repair/remodel activity is expected to grow at mid- to high single-digit rates over the next 2 years due to multiple factors, including an aging housing stock, record levels of home equity and strong price appreciation driving big ticket remodeling and tight existing housing supply leading consumers to invest in existing homes as well as spurring demand for new homes.\nIn terms of new residential construction, the years of undersupply of new homes post the 2008 economic crisis has created a significant housing stock supply issue as just as millennials reach the age when they're most likely to purchase a home. We expect that this will continue to support new residential construction activity, even with the interest rate increases currently being contemplated by the Fed.\nCommercial construction is still in the early stages of a post-COVID recovery, and the secular drivers for safe, healthy, professional working spaces and more efficient buildings will contribute to positive activity levels in 2022 and the coming years. And lastly, we have strong backlogs in our industrial businesses, and we remain optimistic that cyclical recoveries in the auto and the aerospace sectors are beginning to emerge.\nThis is very meaningful to both revenue growth and profitability for the segment. To size it, we think it is a $300 million to $400 million multiyear growth opportunity with accompanying margins returning to the mid- to high teens over time. And while we see continued momentum within our core markets, we will monitor and respond accordingly if and when we observe any adverse impact from a higher interest rate environment and/or significant elasticity of demand effects following our pricing actions.\nOn top of the market, we continue to reinvest in growth, including leading-edge product innovation, e-commerce and electrification that will position us for sustained share gains. In fact, since the start of the pandemic, we have invested in over 1,500 human resource additions in R&D, commercial and e-commerce functions in Tools & Outdoor. And that is before the impact of any acquisitions. On that note, I'll now address our recent capital allocation and portfolio actions.\nA key aspect of the Stanley Black & Decker value-creation model is our active approach to portfolio management and commitment to an investor-friendly capital allocation strategy. Over the long term, we look to invest 50% of our excess capital into strategic M&A and return the other 50% to shareholders through a consistent growing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. The 2 security divestitures were at a trailing EBITDA multiples of mid- to high teens and have a headline price of $4.1 billion in the aggregate, resulting in approximately $3.5 billion of after-tax proceeds. These impressive results validate the investments we made in transforming our security business over the last several years and have enabled significant return of capital to shareholders as well as reinvestment in our highly focused core businesses.\nDeploying capital into outdoor enabled us to acquire approximately $3 billion of revenue at 8.5x EBITDA and a material opportunity for margin enhancement over time as we fully integrate these businesses and leverage our combined scale, brands, manufacturing expertise, R&D and access to both the retail and the pro channels.\nNow there has been some noise and misinformation out there about our recent outdoor acquisitions, and I'm now going to present you with the facts. We have a sound strategy for outdoor anchored on 4 pillars: electrification, brand and channel strength, cutting-edge innovation and large-format manufacturing capacity and experience. Overnight, we have assembled a formidable leading player in the $25 billion outdoor power equipment market that is capable of growing 10% to 15% organically at mid-teens operating margin for many years to come. This business will lead the charge in the electrification of both large-format and handheld professional outdoor power equipment.\nWe will also bring our outstanding differentiated line of autonomous electrified products under the DEWALT brand to the professional landscaping channel, where the acquisitions comes in network of independent dealers with 2,500 unique outlets, skewing towards the pro market and representing half of the $25 billion addressable market. Such channel access represents a compelling competitive advantage, and it is critical to above-average growth and profitability.\nI'm also excited about the breakthrough innovations resulting from the integration of the outdoor acquisitions. And even though the new team just completed its first quarter together, they've been working together for several years and will bring to market a strong set of new innovations at attractive margins just ahead of the 2023 outdoor season.\nWe're off to a great start, and I have strong conviction in our ability to deliver outstanding cordless and autonomous new products to the market that will result in growth and margin expansion. And the 13.7% operating margin delivered in our first quarter together is just a taste of the profitability potential ahead in the coming years.\nAnd lastly, we have added 8 manufacturing locations through our outdoor acquisitions. In addition to the instant capacity to support growing demand, the resulting extensive manufacturing footprint gives us an enormous competitive advantage over our small-format, electric-only competitors. In short, despite what you may have heard, our outdoor acquisitions have enabled us to become the outdoor power equipment leader, best positioned to electrify the industry given our multiple competitive advantages.\nOur outdoor business is now a powerful growth engine with approximately $4-plus billion in annual revenue with anticipated organic growth of 10% to 15% a year. This is an exciting period for our company with a portfolio focused on core businesses in tools, outdoor and industrial and attractive markets in construction, DIY, automotive and industrial.\nAnd I'd now like to turn the call over to Don Allan, who will provide an update on how we're positioning our supply chain for growth as well as more detailed commentary on first quarter actuals and our full year outlook. Don?\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident & CFO, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned in his comments, our focus remains on ensuring we serve the continued healthy demand and investing in our supply chain to further strengthen our position for sustained growth. As I've highlighted on prior calls, we took multiple actions in 2021 to navigate through the global supply chain challenges and further strengthen our manufacturing capacity, sourcing, operational efficiency and agility.\nThese actions are allowing us to better serve our customers and deliver growth in revenue and cash flow in 2022 and beyond. Key areas of investment included adding capacity consistent with our make where we sell strategy, co-investing with strategic sourcing partners with a focus on batteries and electronic components and deploying our manufacturing 4.0 automation solutions to enhance productivity, labor efficiency and competitive costs. Our investments in this area as well as our electronic component availability continue to progress as expected and remain on track.\nDemand continues to outpace availability for our hottest products amid this constrained supply chain environment. First, as it relates to inventory, our actions will position us to meet the current demand levels while improving working capital to deliver strong cash flow generation. Greater working capital efficiency and cash flow generation remains a significant opportunity in 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, last year, we made significant investments in inventory to help meet the outsized demand in the tools business. Our 2022 cash flow guidance assumes that we can modestly reduce inventory versus 2021 levels, and we expect much of that improvement to occur in the second half of the year once we get through this spring to early summer selling season.\nOur inventory at the end of Q1 was up approximately $850 million versus the year-end '21 balance. The increase in our first quarter inventory was primarily due to working capital seasonality to support the peak outdoor buying season, spring merchandising and the Father's Day selling season. This investment in working capital, coupled with the earlier timing of certain tax payments, contributed to a free cash outflow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter. This Q1 performance will reverse as we execute on the remaining 2022 working capital initiatives.\nWithin the supply chain, tight component supply and elongated transportation times continue to be a challenge. However, we have seen some signs of stabilization. For example, our goods in transit for the quarter remained stable and similar to year-end levels. The Port of L.A. has seen improvements with reduced congestion, and moving goods from the ports to our DCs is not a significant source of delays.\nAs it relates to China, we continue to frequently monitor our end-to-end supply chain. And while there has been some minor COVID-driven disruption to date, it remains manageable at this stage. This is a dynamic situation that we will continue to watch closely in the coming weeks.\nAs it relates to semiconductors, we continue to see improved supply in line with expectations. Our Tier 1 contract manufacturers received more semiconductors in the first quarter, which will enable us to increase the throughput for our professional power tools in Q2. We are on track for an improvement to our electronic component supply of approximately 20% in 2Q and further improvement in 3Q, which will support better fill rates, customer inventory positions and higher revenues as we progress through the remainder of the year.\nSo in summary, we are actively managing a very dynamic supply chain and responding with agility to position ourselves to meet the continued strong demand we are experiencing, especially within the professional power tool portion of our business.\nTurning to our segment results. The headline for the first quarter is that demand for our products remains healthy, and we are executing the necessary pricing actions to mitigate higher input costs. In Tools & Outdoor, we grew revenue 24% as the strategic outdoor power equipment acquisitions contributed 27% and price drove 5 points of growth.\nPrice realization accelerated sequentially because of the new global price increases implemented in response to commodity and transportation inflation experienced in late 2021. These factors were partially offset by a 6% decline in volume and 2% from currency. Volume was impacted by electronic component availability, and we have not seen evidence of broad demand destruction related to price elasticity.\nWe estimate that supply constraints resulted in approximately $200 million in unfulfilled professional power tool opportunities in the first quarter, which, if realized, would have resulted in volume growth and a record prior year performance comp. We will better position to capitalize on this volume opportunity as we improve supply in the coming 2 quarters.\nRegional organic growth was relatively in line with our expectations, with Europe up 2%, emerging markets contributing 5% and North America down 3%.\nThe Tools & Outdoor operating margin rate for the segment was 14%, representing a 260 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to execute on price to protect our margins, and we saw the sequential benefit in Q1. Comparing the Tools & Outdoor margin rate versus prior year, we experienced the decline as price realization was more than offset by inflation, higher transportation costs, growth investments and lower volume. The outdoor acquisitions were near line average margin rates for the quarter, representing a very strong start to the year.\nU.S. retail point-of-sale remains at healthy levels, supported by strong professional construction markets and our innovation. While the POS comps were down versus a stimulus-aided Q1 2021, the normalized 2019 comparative growth rates accelerated from the levels we experienced in the back half of 2021. This strengthens our conviction that we continue to experience a very solid demand environment.\nNow turning to the Tools & Outdoor SBUs. Power tools was down 1% organically in the quarter. We continue to realize benefits from our price increases, along with continued demand for our innovative offerings for the pro and tradesperson. We have launched a series of products under our industry-leading CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY FATMAX, Black & Decker and DEWALT brands. Our recent breakthrough, DEWALT POWERSTACK, continues to be very well received by end users and is expected to be a multi-hundred million dollar contributor to growth in 2022.\nHand tools, accessories and storage declined 1% in the quarter against a very difficult comparable. Revenue was supported by pricing and new product innovation. Some of our new innovations include extending our world's first DEWALT 20-volt laser platform with the new 20-volt MAX laser, expanding our DEWALT ToughSystem storage to include soft storage solutions designed to optimize efficiency in organization, and we added a new IRWIN STRAIT-LINE tape to our industry-leading tape measure lineup.\nMoving to outdoor products. This business grew 4% organically, while the addition of MTD and Excel added over $800 million of revenue. Growth was driven by price realization, expanded distribution and new product innovations under the Black & Decker CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands. Our acquisitions are also benefiting from product innovation, including recent launches such as the redesigned FasTrak zero-turn mower line for commercial use and the first semi-autonomous zero-turn mower with the Cub Cadet SurePath.\nDespite the strong start for these acquisitions, this growth was modestly impacted from a later breaking outdoor season due to colder weather in many parts of North America. We expect these revenues to be recovered in the second and third quarter.\nOur first full quarter as one outdoor team was very successful, and we remain on track to integrate 3 assets into a new $4 billion revenue platform, as you heard from Jim. As the integration progresses, we continue to build conviction around the innovation, growth and synergy opportunities. We are even more excited about the electrification growth opportunity as we work to integrate these organizations and processes. The team is energized, focused and off to a great start.\nI want to thank the Tools & Outdoor organization for their efforts in the first quarter. We made progress against our key operational goals for 2022 with strong price realization, improved power tool supply and actioning a strong plan for working capital reduction as we move throughout the year. This dynamic environment requires agility, and I know we have the right people with the perseverance and dedication to be successful.\nNow shifting to Industrial. Segment revenue declined 2% versus last year as the 5 points of price realization were more than offset by a 5% volume decline and a 2% negative impact from currency. Operating margin was 6.9% as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation and market-driven volume declines, in particular, in our higher-margin automotive business where our customers remain constrained by their own supply chain challenges.\nLooking within the segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were down 3% as 5% general industrial fastener growth was more than offset by lower automotive OEM production as well as a modest decline in aerospace.\nOur auto fastener business continues to successfully operate in a dynamic environment with customer production fluctuations. Despite this, auto fasteners once again demonstrated outperformance versus light vehicle production. And the business is also benefiting from accelerating growth and content gains across the electric vehicle production space.\nOur industrial fastener business enjoys a healthy backlog and delivered growth at nearly 2x global IPI in the first quarter.\nThe aerospace fastener business delivered its third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business is focused on capturing the recovery in the OEM production, which is beginning to emerge. We expect in 2022 aero fasteners will begin to demonstrate organic growth as it starts the cyclical recovery back towards historical levels of revenue.\nInfrastructure organic revenues were up 4% as 13% growth in attachment tools were partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum remains strong in attachment tools driven by record backlogs, dealer inventories continuing to trend below targeted levels and elevated market confidence due to the U.S. infrastructure bill.\nOur Industrial team is continuing to make steady progress with its revenue and profitability improvements. And we are primed to leverage the cyclical recovery that is on the horizon and capitalize on the auto electrification trend as well.\nTurning to the next slide. The operating environment continues to be dynamic, and the recent invasion in the Ukraine by Russia has driven a new wave of inflation versus the backdrop earlier this year. From an input cost perspective, our updated expectations for 2022 commodity inflation and cost to serve is now $1.4 billion versus our January expectation of $800 million.\nThe key drivers of the incremental $600 million reflects significant increases in battery inputs such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, oil-related inputs such as transport and resins, and continued upward movements in other base metals and steel. Looking at the commodity indices since we issued our initial 2022 guidance, lithium, nickel and cobalt are all up approximately 90%, 50% and 7%, respectively, whereas oil is also up nearly 15%.\nIf we break down the $600 million increase, it is in primarily 4 major categories: $200 million in batteries, $200 million in transportation costs, $100 million in resins due to oil prices and $50 million in gas engine costs.\nIf you look at our commodity basket discretely, the increase to our total direct material spend is up over 30% since the end of 2020. Nearly half of this total impact occurred in February and March of this year. While these commodities continue to be volatile today, we do have solid visibility to the expected sustained impact. And we are building this into the plan and taking additional pricing actions to offset the impact to our margins.\nWe have executed 3 rounds of price, which are now in place across our global businesses. And we are in the process of implementing additional price actions in response to the new wave of inflation that has occurred in the last 60 days. These new price actions will be on top of the 6 to 7 points of price we included in our prior guidance, and we now expect price to contribute high single digits for 2022.\nOur teams remain focused on pricing actions to offset the cumulative inflation impacts experienced in the last 9 to 10 months. We believe this will allow us to expand our core margins, and that will begin to emerge in late 2022.\nAs a reminder, before diving into the details on Slide 9, our guidance does not include our security businesses, which are now recorded as discontinued operations.\nSo moving on to our 2022 guidance. We are planning for total revenue growth in the mid-20s, inclusive of organic growth of 7%. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $9.50 up to $10.50. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $7.20 up to $8.30, inclusive of onetime charges related to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russian business closure and acquisition-related costs. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $460 million.\nOn the right side of the slide, we have outlined the components of our EPS adjustment versus our prior estimate. We made 2 portfolio decisions since January guidance, which reduced EPS by $0.45. The divestiture of our Stanley Access Technologies business reduces EPS by $0.30. And there will be a $0.15 impact from the closure of our Russian business. Therefore, the January guidance midpoint adjusted for these 2 decisions is $11.80.\nIncremental commodity and cost to serve just discussed results in a $3 cost increase or reduction in EPS. Then you have the offset of the outlined price actions, which add $1.70 benefit, which is a net of a lower volume planning assumption to protect ourselves for any potential demand elasticity.\nBelow-the-line items are relatively neutral as a lower tax rate and other expense assumptions are offset by the impact of shares from an adoption of a new accounting standard in Q1 related to preferred shares. This accounting standard change will only impact 2022 and reverses in 2023 as these shares will be retired in November of '22.\nTurning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic growth is expected to be in the mid- to high single digits, supported by price, core and breakthrough innovation and healthy demand across our end markets. We expect that our strategic outdoor acquisitions will contribute just over $3 billion in revenue in 2022.\nFor the full year, Tools & Outdoor consolidated margins are expected to be down on a year-over-year basis as inflation and acquisition mix pressure margins. As you think about Tools & Outdoor margins, excluding acquisitions, our plan calls for a relatively similar OEM in the second quarter to what we just delivered in Q1. We then expect year-over-year core margins to be up in the back half.\nThere is a meaningful midterm opportunity to improve margins within the outdoor acquisitions over the coming years. And this continues to be a significant priority for us. We expect high single-digit margins this year, and we see the potential for low double-digit margins over the next few years.\nWe believe the Industrial segment will achieve low double-digit organic growth driven by innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across much of the portfolio. The Industrial margin rate is expected to be positive year-over-year. Leveraging strong revenue growth, productivity and price, this segment will experience sequential improvement each quarter in 2022.\nLet's now shift to some color on Q2, full year cash flow and our share repurchase program. We expect the second quarter adjusted EPS will approximate 21% to 22% of the full year. This assumes low single-digit organic growth and a strong revenue contribution from acquisitions.\nNow turning to cash flow. As a result of our lower full earnings guidance and higher inventory values at year-end due to the additional wave of inflation we experienced in the last 60 days, we expect free cash flow to now be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. This range does still reflect a modest working capital reduction year-over-year.\nWe still plan to complete our $4 billion share repurchase program. However, since we see a lower cash flow performance in 2022 for the reasons just articulated, we will defer the remaining portion of -- or $1.7 billion until 2023. We continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation approach that aims to balance share repurchase activity with a commitment to dividends and strong investment-grade credit ratings. We are committed to the completion of this repurchase program in 2023.\nThe organization is focused on execution in this dynamic environment, with the key operational priorities centered around the following areas: improving supply chain and customer service levels, driving above-market organic growth, delivering on our price and cost control measures, successfully integrating our strategic outdoor acquisitions, closing the 2 security divestitures later in this year as planned and leveraging the SBD operating model to improve our working capital efficiency in 2022 and beyond.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?\n\nJames M. Loree\n\nCEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Don. There is no question that we are operating in one of the more challenging environments in recent times. And to succeed in such an environment, we are intensely focused on the inputs we can control. We've strategically optimized our business portfolio, creating a stronger, faster growing and highly profitable company with distinctive competitive advantages. We've continued our long history of returning excess capital to shareholders through our impressive annual dividend record and share repurchases, together totaling almost $3 billion in 2022 with more to come in 2023.\nWe've reinvested in our core businesses, adding resources to support our growth catalysts in electrification, e-commerce and innovation. This type of focused reinvestment will be an ongoing and consistent approach for us and the company going forward, and we've made substantial progress in resolving supply chain constraints, most of which are expected to dissipate during the balance of this year. And we have now proven our ability to offset the impact of hyperinflation through pricing actions that stick.\nWe've made an enormous commitment to ESG as we've shifted our business portfolio to areas that both support growth and benefit our stakeholders and society. For an impressive immersion into this topic, I refer you to our 2021 ESG report, which is available online effective today.\nAnd we are confident in the strategic positioning of our company and look forward to continuing to demonstrate our ability to thrive in 2022 and beyond by driving top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation.\nWith that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you."

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, president and CFO. And our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we'll refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.\nThis morning, Jim and Don will review our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just 1 question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that you may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.\n\nJames M. Loree\n\nCEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Dennis. As you saw from our press release, we delivered a record year in '21 for revenue, organic growth and EPS. We benefited from extraordinarily strong customer demand, which continues for our innovative products and portfolio of brands, both of which underpin and support our position as the world's #1 tool company. I want to thank our colleagues across the globe for their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with the highest quality products as well as for their outstanding effort in helping to deliver this record-setting performance amidst the confluence of COVID era challenges related to supply chain inflation, other external factors.\nAnd during the year, we took several significant strategic actions to optimize our business portfolio, completing 2 outdoor power equipment acquisitions, adding $3 billion of revenue as well as the announced divestiture of our Electronic Security business for 16x EBITDA, sharpening our focus on tools, outdoor and industrial. These transactions are reshaping our portfolio into a faster growing, more profitable one with lots of runway to both support and benefit from the ESG movement as well.\nThis portfolio will also benefit from important societal trends, including household formation, increased consumer nesting with focus on the home and garden, electrification and infrastructure investment. In addition, this month, we plan to begin the return of $4 billion of capital to our shareholders through our previously announced share repurchase program, including as much as $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We believe these transactions, the acquisitions, the divestiture and our substantial repurchase will result in significant value creation for investors in the short, medium and long term.\nTo summarize our 2021 performance, our revenues were $15.6 billion, up 20%, driven by a record 17% organic growth, with all businesses contributing. Our total company operating margin rate for the year was 13.9%, down versus prior year due to the growing cost inflation and supply chain challenges that emerged as the year progressed as we chose to take the necessary steps to deliver for our customers. We see this core margin rate as a temporary trough given that we expect our continued 2021/2022 pricing actions will be sufficient to fully offset the $1.4 billion of cost growth associated with inflation and increased cost to serve during the same 2-year time period.\nFull year 2021 adjusted EPS was $10.48, a 30% increase versus 2020. And for the year ahead, we have a proactive plan and approach that is focused on execution, growth, margin improvement and strong cash flow. Our teams are focused on leveraging our operating model and execution principles that have allowed us to deliver consistent, strong revenue and EPS growth over many years, including in 2021. Although we were pleased with the total year revenue and EPS performance, the fourth quarter was challenging, with supply chain and inflationary impacts, which impacted working capital.\nWe strategically prioritized building additional inventory in 2021 to capture the strong demand. And in addition, we experienced the impacts from the clogged supply chain, which intensified as the year progressed as component shortages, shipping delays and inflation drove inventory levels even higher. Accordingly, free cash flow for the year was $144 million, which reflects a $1.8 billion increase in inventory. Suffice it to say this working capital increase was higher than anticipated unnecessary but partially temporary investment which will reverse by at least $500 million this year, converting working capital back to a cash generator during the year.\nOur team has a long history of driving working capital turns improvement and asset efficiency with our SBD operating model. We have comprehensive enterprise-wide plans in place to ensure we serve our customers while also delivering strong cash flow in '22 and beyond.\nLooking specifically at the fourth quarter. Revenue was up 2% to $4.1 billion with 5 points of price, 6 points from acquisitions. Volume was down 8% due to promotional shipment timing in 2020 and was impacted by logistical supply chain challenges as well. Overall, we remain confident in our multiyear growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses. We remain bullish on construction, DIY as well as gradual recoveries in the automotive and aerospace OEM markets. We've developed an array of growth catalysts, including product innovation, e-commerce and electrification to position our businesses to capture this opportunity. And we are continuing to focus on innovation, manufacturing, automation, capacity expansion and our logistics capabilities to meet the elevated demand in the near term and support strong sustainable growth over the medium and long term.\nIn this regard, we believe that we are well positioned in 2022 with a target of 7% to 8% organic growth; total revenue growth aggregating over $4 billion; adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 19%; and $2 billion of free cash flow. As noted, our tools and outdoor businesses enjoyed high demand levels across our global markets and channels. And as we think about some of the causal factors in North America, many of the traditional drivers of housing and repair/remodel activity are trending in a positive direction. Household formation, driven by millennial first-time home purchasers as well as the urban exodus support strong housing demand and the low levels of existing housing inventory will continue to be a catalyst for new residential construction.\nHome prices have appreciated, building home equity, which generally supports home reinvestment growth through repair and remodel activity. In recent years, the consumer mindset and behavior patterns regarding Home and Garden have shifted as more time is spent in these environments. Homebase for many has grown in importance, serving multiple purposes, including as a sanctuary, as a locus for increased indoor, outdoor activities and as a workspace for more permanent remote and hybrid workers.\nThese behavioral shifts are driving robust project activity for both contractors and DIYers not only in the U.S. but globally as well. Leading indicators for non-resi construction, such as ABI and Dodge rebounded during much of 2021 and have remained positive as construction activity has continued to recover. Industrial production is returning to pre-pandemic levels as manufacturers look to replenish their supply chains. The growth momentum that we built in 2021 in our industrial fastener and attachment tools businesses is expected to continue in 2022, and we expect to benefit from the recently signed $1.2 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill as well.\nAnd lastly, we are cautiously optimistic that the cyclical recovery in auto and aero will begin to emerge in 2022, a $300 million to $400 million multiyear revenue growth opportunity for industrial. And so while there is much to be excited about within our core markets, we will carefully watch for any impacts from a higher interest rate environment or changes in the elasticity of demand following price increases and react accordingly if things change.\nTo keep our market and brand vitality fresh, we continue to invest selectively in growth catalysts, including innovation, e-commerce and electrification. These will position us for sustained share gains in the future. These catalysts capitalize on key global trends, many of which are expected to continue in the coming years. Across the board, we have competitive strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, Stanley, Stanley FatMax and Black & Decker, our category depth channel development and operations excellence are coupled with a track record and commitment to market-leading innovation. Our new power stack battery system launched in December is enjoying an excellent market reception and has the potential for several hundred million dollars of organic growth in 2022.\nPopular science called it \"the best cordless power tool battery we've ever used.\" With our sharpened focus and increased innovation investments, our product development plans are robust as we look to nearly double the number of professional power tool products we offer over the next 3 years. The rapid acceleration and the shift of demand to e-commerce has continued, and we believe that we have at least twice the revenue in this channel as our next closest competitor.\nIn 2021, we continue to enjoy strong double-digit growth in e-commerce, and it now represents a $2.5 billion channel for us globally and it's approaching 20% of our tool business revenue. The increased societal focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very attractive multiyear opportunity for outdoor power equipment. Our existing business grew almost 40% in 2021 as we continue to drive the conversion of handheld units and push mowers to cordless electric. With the addition of MTD and Excel in late 2021, we have assembled a $4 billion outdoor power franchise, which will lead the conversion of larger equipment such as riders and zero turns electric and autonomous as well.\nWe have the ability to capitalize on the electrification of automotive as well through engineered fastening. This move from internal combustion to plug-in hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results in a 3 to 6x increase in Stanley Black & Decker dollar content per vehicle produced by OEMs. We are also focused on the other growth and revenue synergy opportunities in outdoor, such as global channel expansion and brand development. We have a compelling opportunity to serve the professional customer segment by developing gas and electric offerings under the DEWALT brand, among others.\nWe now have access to more than 2,500 independent equipment dealers across the U.S. that carry leading-edge higher-margin products, which serve a professional user. This dealer channel opportunity is compelling as it is sized similarly to the retail channel but comes with historically higher profitability. Finally, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high-margin parts and service segment as we build our presence, serve our customers.\nI'm excited to share that we are updating our expectations for 2022 EPS contribution from these outdoor acquisitions. MTD had a strong finish in 2021 and was able to outperform our initial plan for both revenue and margin. They also remain on track with their margin improvement trajectory as they did a nice job in 2021, implementing price actions to counter inflation and are continuing to do that in 2022. With a higher '21 base and improved forward outlook, we now expect our outdoor acquisitions to contribute $0.85 of EPS in 2022. This represents a $0.20 improvement and a $0.60 year-over-year tailwind for EPS growth.\nAs I sum up my section today, I am excited by the portfolio changes we affected in 2021. The establishment of a high potential outdoor platform, the Security business divestiture and a commitment to repurchase $4 billion in 2022 all set the stage for value creation this year and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide some additional insights. Don?\n\nDonald Allan\n\nPresident & CFO, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we are focused on serving robust demand and investing in our supply chain to position us for sustained growth. We took multiple actions in 2021 to navigate the global supply chain and position the business to have the capacity, sourcing, operational efficiency and resilience to serve our customers and deliver significant growth in revenue and cash flow in 2022 and beyond.\nThese key investments include adding capacity consistent with our Make Where We Sell strategy, co-investing with strategic sourcing partners with a focus on batteries and semiconductors and investing in automation solutions to support productivity, labor efficiency and competitive costs. Our capacity additions are on track, and we have opened 2 new power tool plants and 1 new hand tool facility in North America, which are now ramping up. These new manufacturing plants will enable shorter lead times and be accompanied by parallel regional development of our supply chain base over time, enhancing local sourcing and speed to market.\nAs it relates to strategic sourcing, we have added new battery suppliers and made co-investments with key partners that have put us in a great position as we enter 2022. We have the necessary battery supply and capacity to support significant growth in tools and to fuel our electrification strategy in outdoor.\nThe supply environment remains tight for semiconductors and electronic components. This, plus the elongated global supply chain, which significantly increased inventory in transit, impacted our ability to generate more volume in the fourth quarter. Semiconductor shortages have been a pain point for many global industrials, and we have been investing to improve supply to enable significant tools growth. For example, adding new Tier 2 and 3 suppliers for chips, co-investing with Tier 1 suppliers to improve their capacity and taking actions to lower lead times across our supply base.\nAs mentioned in October, we expect semiconductor supply to improve in Q2 versus current levels. Based on current commitments from our semiconductor suppliers, we expect a 20% to 30% increase in chips in Q2 versus the current run rate. In summary, we have been working to alleviate constraints on many key components and are now down to the last critical few, which will unlock more supply as we move into the second quarter.\nWe are also advancing our Industry 4.0 capabilities, driving automation throughout our manufacturing environment. This will make our U.S. manufacturing plants more competitive as well as improved productivity in factories across the globe. We just completed a significant flexible automation assembly line in our major U.S. power tool plant. It is up and running.\nLast year, we also made significant investments in inventory to help meet the outsized demand in the tools business. Excluding the consolidation impact from acquisitions, we increased our core inventory position by $1.8 billion as compared to year-end 2020. 2/3 of this increase is composed of inputs, work in progress or goods in transit that will work their way through our supply chain to support growth and improve fill rates with our customers.\nAs a result, fourth quarter free cash flow was $175 million, which brings our year-to-date result to $144 million, significantly below our prior expectation for 2021. The main driver of the deviation was related to the congestion of the global supply chain on working capital. Let me unpack this to provide some additional color.\nFirst, we ended up building more inventory and tools versus our expectation. This was primarily related to a combination of goods in transit, expanding in the quarter as we experience port and other logistical delays. The increased tools inventory is needed to serve existing and projected demand, and therefore, we believe we will sell through this incremental inventory during 2022.\nSecondly, we are holding on to inventory longer than we have historically due to longer shipping and lead times, which has changed the relationship between inventory and payables. This dynamic also led to a deviation versus our October expectations. Finally, the MTD and Excel inventory build ahead of the outdoor season was not in our forecast back in October due to the unknown timing of each of those closings.\nThe global supply chain is dynamic, as we all know, and requires new intensity, focus and agility to react to the changes as well as to be able to predict the dependencies that may be -- may not be consistent with past experiences. We have a long history of using the SBD operating model to drive high asset efficiency, strong cash flow and superior cash flow return on investment. These processes and tools with some new enhancements will ensure we mitigate the temporary portion of the inventory increase and the correlated impact to account payables. We will do this while holding the appropriate levels of inventory and making CapEx investments to support the strategic growth initiatives you heard about earlier.\nWe expect to drive working capital efficiency in 3 primary areas which will increase supply chain predictability, optimize inventory location and improve inventory turns from acquired businesses. One, opportunities will definitely arise as the semiconductor pressure alleviates in Q2 and the electronic component supply improved. Two, we built a dedicated team focused on lowering in-transit inventory. This team will also focus on product SKU optimization of our days of stock, ensuring we have the right inventory when it's needed by our customers. And three, we are also deploying the SBD operating model across our recent acquisitions to drive efficiency in all aspects of working capital. MTD and Excel entered the portfolio around 3 turns, and we have line of sight to improving that metric across a multiyear period.\nThis management team has dealt with headwinds and temporary shifts in business conditions for 2 decades plus. And therefore, we are confident that we will improve our turns and believe the cash flow working capital benefit is at least a $500 million opportunity, which is incorporated into our $2 billion cash flow commitment for 2022.\nIn summary, our portfolio and supply chain actions from 2021 have put us in great shape for 2022 and beyond.\nI will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 3% revenue growth as the acquisitions of MTD and Excel contributed 7% and price delivered 5 points. These factors were partially offset by a decline of 8% in volume and 1% from currency. Regional organic growth was 7% in the emerging markets with weaker performances in North America and Europe due to: one, a tough comparable related to the prior year holiday shipping timing; two, the current year volume constraints caused by supply chain logistical challenge I previously mentioned; and three, the anticipated Q4 semiconductor shortages we discussed in October.\nPricing actions delivered strong mid-single-digit growth in response to commodity inflation and higher cost to serve aligned with expectations. This was the most significant quarterly price benefit the Tools & Storage business has seen in modern history. The operating margin rate for the segment was 11.4%, down versus last year as pricing benefits were more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs, growth investments in volume. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the first quarter of 2022 is currently expected to be the peak of the inflation and supply chain cost headwinds, and then these headwinds will begin to recede versus the prior year.\nThis expected trend in headwinds combined with the pricing actions we completed in 2021, the additional price actions to be completed and implemented in 2022 that I will touch on a little bit later in the call, and the cost controls that we recently put in place will result in profitability rates trending back to normalized levels as we move through 2022 for Tools & Storage.\nEnd-user demand strength remains persistent across all markets as the consumer reconnection with the home and garden, innovation and e-commerce continue to drive growth. Our e-commerce platforms grew over 30% in 2021. The innovation pipeline continues to be impressive with new product launches across the portfolio, in addition to an exciting line of new product introductions in 2022 within the DEWALT, FLEXVOLT atomic and extreme power tool platform and also across the construction, automotive and industrial end markets.\nPoint-of-sale demand in U.S. retail grew high single digits and channel inventory ended below historical levels. We saw strong professional driven demand in the commercial and industrial channels, which grew in the fourth quarter and achieved 28% organic growth in the year.\nNow turning to the Tools & Storage SBU. Power Tools delivered 20% organic growth in 2021, which was supported by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and Stanley FatMax, inclusive of DEWALT Power Stack, which is off to a fantastic start. Hand tools, accessories and storage achieved full year organic growth of 17%, inclusive of 26% international organic growth, fueled by robust market demand and new product highlights, including the CRAFTSMAN trade stack and DEWALT ToughSystem portable storage solutions as well as new additions to the DEWALT Elite Series circular saw blade.\nMoving to Outdoor Products. This business grew 3% organically in the quarter, while the addition of MTD and Excel added over $200 million of revenue. The outdoor team had a great 2021, achieving 40% organic growth, inclusive of share gain led by electrification. This came from new listings and innovations under the Black & Decker CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brand. Our acquisitions also had strong innovation-led organic growth for 2021 with new launches such as the redesign Hustler Fast Track zero-turn mower line for commercial use and the first semi-autonomous zero-turn mower with Cub Cadet Share path.\nWe are beginning the journey to integrate our acquisitions into a new $4 billion revenue strategic business unit and are making great strides towards becoming 1 team focused on innovation, growth and capturing the cost and revenue synergies from these transactions. The collective efforts of our tools and outdoor teams across the globe were unrelenting as they continue to navigate this dynamic operating environment. I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for your perseverance and dedication.\nNow shifting to Industrial. Quarterly segment revenue declined 7% versus last year, as the 3 points of price realization were more than offset by 9% volume and 1% currency. Operating margin was 9.3%, down versus last year as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation and market-driven volume declines in the higher-margin automotive and aerospace fastener businesses due to our customers primarily in those markets lowering their production.\nLooking further within the segment. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 9% as strong general industrial growth of 12% was more than offset by aerospace market pressure and lower automotive OEM production, which obviously resulted from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener business navigated customer production fluctuations and a dynamic market as they move through the year. Despite these external challenges, auto fasteners demonstrated 9 points of outperformance versus light vehicle production and the business successfully doubled its revenue tied to electric vehicle production.\nThe business is exceptionally well positioned for the cyclical rebound in production and for the secular trend of electrification. Our industrial fastener business realized 12% organic growth in the quarter and exit the year with a healthy backlog, which is up nearly 50% versus 2020. It was satisfying to see the business achieve organic growth over 18% in 2021, 2x the global industrial production index. While aerospace continued to decline significantly versus prior year, we have started to see green shoots, with revenues sequentially improving for 2 quarters in a row. This business is focused on capturing the coming rebound in production that will begin in '22 and continue beyond that.\nInfrastructure organic revenues were up 3% as 18% growth in attachment tools was largely offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools market, the strong demand from our OEM and independent dealer customers, generating orders that were up 59% versus the prior year and a backlog that is nearly 5x year ending 2020 levels. To summarize our thoughts on Industrial, we saw some pockets of strong growth, combined with early stages of stabilization in the challenged markets I mentioned as we close 2021. And we are looking forward to leveraging the cyclical recovery and to capitalizing on the auto electrification trend over the next 2 to 3 years.\nTurning to the operating environment. We are actively engaged on multiple fronts to support margin recovery and believe headwinds have now stabilized. The 2022 carryover impact inclusive of currency is sized at nearly $800 million. From an input cost and transport rate perspective, we had assumed that the levels seen in the fourth quarter continue for all of 2022. This could be a second half opportunity if recent trends in commodity pricing hold. However, with the continuing dynamic environment, we are not counting on that, and we remain diligent on executing several actions to support margin recovery. We are taking more price actions in the first quarter to offset these headwinds. We are notifying our North American Tools & Outdoor customers this week about new price increases of 5% to 10% or more depending on the category. These actions are in addition to the 5 points of price already delivered, which underscores that the price environment today is very different from history.\nOur expectation is 100% coverage of inflation during this cycle. Our 2022 plan now calls for 6% to 7% price, which will be exceeding the carryover cost impact. These actions in aggregate will support sequential margin improvement in the coming quarters and year-over-year margin improvement in the back half of the year. In terms of when price cost turns positive, we still expect that to occur in the middle of the year, as close to 90% of the $800 million of headwinds are estimated to occur in the front half of 2022. Finally, as always, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and see a pathway to generate $100 million to $150 million of 2022 opportunity.\nNow before diving into guidance, there's 1 point that I would like to mention. As a reminder from our release, this guidance does not include the commercial electronic security and health care businesses, which are now recorded as discontinued operations as a result of the announced divestiture in December.\nMoving to our 2022 guidance on Slide 11. We are planning for total revenue growth in the mid-20s, inclusive of organic growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share range of $12 up to $12.50 or increasing approximately 15% to 19% versus 2021. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.10, up to [$10.77], inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs, cost reduction and functional transformation initiatives. The current estimate for pretax charges is approximately $380 million.\nFrom a segment perspective, total Tools & Storage organic growth is expected to be in high single digits, supported by price, core and breakthrough innovation, continued strong demand across our end markets and the improvement of our customer inventories. The Industrial segment is expected to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit organic growth, driven by new products, pricing, momentum in industrial fasteners and attachment tools and the beginning of a cyclical recovery in auto and aerospace.\nAs it relates to the acquisitions, we believe they will contribute just over $3 billion in revenue in 2022, primarily from MTD and Excel with about 60% of that revenue occurring in the front half. The team is building momentum, and this will be an acquisitive growth driver in 2022, but more importantly, an organic growth driver for years to come.\nFor the full year, it's still our expectation that Tools & Storage will have a strong year-over-year margin expansion on the core, driven by strong second half improvement, as I discussed earlier. Total segment margin will be down as our outdoor acquisitions enter the portfolio with high single-digit profitability. Improving margins from the outdoor acquisition is a focus in 2022 and, of course, beyond. We expect to improve these margins to low double digits in the 1- to 2-year time frame and mid-teens in the medium term.\nFor Industrial, the margin rate is expected to expand year-over-year, leveraging strong revenue growth, productivity and price. Shifting now to the right side of the page, I will outline the drivers of our year-over-year EPS growth at the midpoint. Our plan is to grow our core earnings base with added benefits from the MTD and Excel acquisitions. As we discussed earlier, we are actively addressing the inflationary environment with a 6% to 7% pricing -- set of pricing actions that should allow us to more than fully recover the carryover impact from inflation and the elevated cost to serve, adding $1.20 up to $1.30 of EPS.\nThe carryover impact of our growth investments in SG&A is a headwind of about $0.20 net of our recent cost containment actions. Our outdoor acquisitions are already building momentum and should generate $0.60 of year-over-year benefit, ahead of our prior estimates. We also realized the $0.65 benefit from the 2022 impact of our $4 billion share repurchase program. This is partially offset by tax and other below the line items of $0.55.\nOur full year tax rate assumption is 10%, and we are also planning for increased interest expense due to a higher rate environment and the financing needs of our strategic capital deployment. So in summary, we expect the business to deliver nearly $1.80 of EPS growth this year to achieve a midpoint of $12.25 of EPS.\nNow to cover what this means in terms of the first quarter, which is expected to be about approximately 13.5% of the full year adjusted EPS. We are planning for tools to have a relatively flat organic growth and industrial to decline in the low single digits, reflecting the tough comp in the automotive business. Acquisitions should contribute about $950 million in revenue as the outdoor season kicks off. Price cost will still be a negative as we experience a significant amount of our full year headwinds in the first quarter. Total company margins should step up from the fourth quarter and in each successive quarter thereafter.\nWe also intend to execute our $2 billion to $2.5 billion of our previously announced $4 billion share repurchase program here in the first quarter. As you think about the quarterly profile for 2022, consider the following factors: one, 90% of our $800 million headwinds occur in the first half of the year; two, the additional pricing actions I mentioned pays into the P&L during the first half; and three, the share repurchase begins to occur in the middle of the first quarter. Therefore, we expect 60% of our annual EPS to be delivered in the second half.\nFor the full year, we expect robust free cash flow generation of $2 billion. This plan considers continued investment in our supply chain, inventory optimization to serve our customers as well as the drawdown of at least $500 million of our working capital, as we previously discussed. We are confident in the steps we have taken and are continuing to take to navigate a dynamic supply environment and optimize our factories. The organization is focused on driving above-market organic growth, delivering on our price and cost control measures, successfully integrating MTD and Excel into the portfolio and leveraging the SBD operating model to improve our working capital efficiency in 2022.\nWe expect executing on these actions as well as our $4 billion allocation to repurchase shares will deliver 15% to 19% adjusted earnings per share growth and a historic free cash flow performance in 2022. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks.\n\nJames M. Loree\n\nCEO & Director, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThanks, Don, for that immersion into what was a very complicated or complex quarter with a lot of ins and outs in the portfolio and lots of dynamics in the end markets and so on. So thanks for taking the time and really giving a very transparent view there. And so as you've seen and heard, we are focused on continuing to serve the robust demand in our markets. Our multiyear runway for growth is compelling. We talked about adding $2.5 billion of growth in 2021 and then another $4-plus billion in 2022.\nOur EPS and revenue set records in last year, and we expect more of the same this year. So we're determined that free cash flow will return to record levels in 2022 as the working capital reverts back to a source of cash. And we're confident in our ability to execute in today's dynamic, volatile environment. Our proven track record of performance over many years supports this.\nOur 6-year revenue and EPS CAGRs, our 6% for revenue, 10% for EPS, respectively, and a new and improved portfolio and a great strategic setup for 2022 and beyond. We're focused on several tactical operational levers to ensure outstanding near-term execution.\nFirst, we're leveraging our price productivity and cost control measures to support a margin rebound throughout the year. Don described that. We're well positioned to achieve price covering the entire $1.4 billion of inflation and cost to serve for the 2-year period 2021, 2022. The unusual cost input increases have stabilized for now, and we are monitoring trends closely to ensure that we respond to trend changes as they develop.\nWe're investing in the supply chain to ensure that we have the necessary capacity and supply to fulfill the strong demand and support significant revenue growth this year and beyond. We're off to a good start integrating the outdoor acquisitions, which are positioned to contribute EPS accretion of $0.85 in total, $0.65 year-over-year and $0.20 ahead of our initial expectations. We're driving working capital reductions, which we expect to translate to an impressive cash flow performance in 2022. And lastly, we're expecting to execute on our $4 billion share repurchase program very, very soon. So I'm confident in our collective ability to deliver another strong year in 2022 with outstanding potential for value creation. With that, Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A.\n\nDennis M. Lange\n\nVP of IR, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please."

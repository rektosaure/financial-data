Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Deckers delivered outstanding second quarter results ahead of our expectations on both the top and the bottom line. Specifically in the second quarter as compared to last year, we drove revenue growth of 9% and and a 14% increase in diluted earnings per share. These results closed out a solid first half for Decker's fiscal year 2026 with highlights that include total company revenue growing by 12%, HOKA revenue increasing by 15%, UGG revenue rising 12% and diluted earnings per share growing by 17%. In the first half, our international regions remain the driving force behind UGG and HOKA revenue growth, increasing 38% versus last year. Year-over-year gains were led by the wholesale channel, in part from earlier shipment timing, while DTC also delivered strong growth for the first half. We continue to see progress from our brand-building marketing investments in these regions, helping grow HOKA awareness and expand UGG [indiscernible] share with consumers around the world.\nI could not be more pleased with how our teams are executing our strategy and connect with consumers who are increasingly looking to HOKA and UGG for innovation and newness. In the U.S., consumer sentiment is still under pressure, but we're encouraged by the size of progress we have seen in our business and have maintained our focus to ensure HOKA and UGG remain positioned for long-term success. The U.S. marketplace remains dynamic with recent consumer trends indicating a heightened preference for multi-brand shopping experiences. We believe UGG and HOKA are prepared to acquire new consumers and gain share in this environment with consumers where they wish to interact with our brands as with strong brand partnerships with premium wholesalers, which help elevate our brands, UGG resonates with consumers with high-quality distinctive products that provide a unique [indiscernible] experience, HOKA sees the highest consumer adoption when people can try its unique blend of technologies, geometries and materials firsthand on their feet. We view this as a strategic opportunity to continue expanding our consumer base across both brands, while maintaining this relationship through our direct-to-consumer business. This approach supports our long-term objective of achieving a balance of 50% between direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. As we enter our historically largest fiscal quarter, our brand and global marketplace teams are focused on delivering profitable growth in building UGG and HOKA for sustainable value creation.\nI'm confident that our solid foundation, sound financial discipline and nimble operations will serve us well to continue executing against our long-term strategic objectives. Steve will provide additional details on our second quarter financial results and an update on our latest fiscal year 2026 projections later in the call. Prior to that, I will share further details on first half brand performance as well as the forward direction we see for HOKA and UGG.\nStarting with HOKA. Global HOKA revenue in the first half increased by 15% versus last year. Performance was driven by consumer [indiscernible] updates to the brand's 3 largest road running franchises: the Clifton, Bondi and Arahi as well as exciting updates in the trail category with the expansion and evolution of the Masate franchise. Bondi, Clifton and Arahi have continued to deliver strong growth and impressive self-rate for the brand as consumers embrace the significant enhancements implemented by our product team. The success of these top franchises helped hold gain market share.\nAccording to Sircana, HOKA gained 2 points of market share in the overall U.S. road running category for the past rolling 12 months ended September 25 and also outpaced the competition in Europe as one of the fastest-growing road running brands across Italy, France and Germany for the first half of 2025. Beyond the success of top franchises, the HOKA team is making great progress developing product families deeply rooted in the brand's organs. We're leveraging a multilayered approach to build recognizable icons that resonate across multiple categories and use cases, including dimensions of peak performance, everyday performance use and versatile active lifestyle. [indiscernible], HOKA's original shoe is the latest example of how we are aligning our products within these key dimensions. Mate X was created to deliver peak performance through maximum cushioning and carbon plate propulsion for agile long-haul efforts on the trail. Masate 5 was upgraded to adapt to all types of trail terrain with premium performance cushioning and traction.\nAs [indiscernible] 2 has been reintroduced from the archive with an updated aesthetic to achieve a contemporary, active lifestyle look. This product family has already contributed [indiscernible] growth during the first half of the year and now accounts for a larger share of total brand revenue, supported by targeted marketing initiatives that have strengthened consumer awareness, visibility and alignment with HOKA's brand heritage. We've previously discussed the importance of the UTMB world Series finals in Samui France, where HOKA is a title sponsor. The event includes 7 races attracting top trail runners from around the globe and nearly 100,000 spectators. HOKA reinforced its leadership in UTMB and it was the top brand in overall Shoe share as well as among top 5 finishers, including first place finishes for HOKA athletes, Jim Walmsley, Francisco Pupi and Martina [indiscernible].\nOur marketing initiatives for the HOKA brand are designed to establish coherent product narratives to foster consumer engagement and encourage adoption across our portfolio. We're seeing traction with our approach to building product families that are supported by marketing investments. This approach will, over time, allow us to further segment and differentiate the marketplace. You will soon see this product strategy evolution comes to life through the [indiscernible] franchise, where we recently introduced the X3 Peak performer in the lineup and in Spring '26, we'll be launching the Mark 7 and Mark Remastered for everyday road running an active lifestyle, respectively.\nFrom a regional standpoint, HOKA performance in the first half was driven by the strength of our international business, where the brand continues to grow awareness and gain market share. We tailor our strategy for each region, taking into account the unique stages of brand distribution and awareness while staying attuned to evolving consumer preferences. What remains consistent is our focus to maintain high levels of full-price selling as we continue to expand our presence within the premium and elevated marketplace. And we're very pleased with HOKA brand's results across the board. HOKA has seen constantly strong gains across all international regions throughout the first half with notable incremental revenue contributions from EMEA and China.\nIn the EMEA region, HOKA is driving impressive results across all countries and segments of distribution, including market share gains and robust reorders with our specialty partners as we continue to drive double-digit growth. Best-in-class sell-through with our key sporting good partners significant percentage gains with athletic and lifestyle specialty accounts, where we are just beginning to build our business and broad-based strength in our DTC channel across Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. with our first German store opening in Berlin and a pop-up retail experience in Shamali for UTMB. In China, the HOKA brand's premium positioning and product innovation continue to drive resilient consumer demand. Highlights include new store openings in key cities that are attracting strong consumer interest, substantial growth in loyalty membership with particularly strong gains with females and younger consumers, industry-leading full-price selling and sell-through rates for wholesale exceeding the goals set for monobrand partner locations as we navigate a dynamic U.S. marketplace, HOKA continues to gain market share in the athletic for category, and we remain dedicated to controlling distribution and driving a pull model of demand.\nThere are a number of positive signals for the HOKA brands U.S. business. They give us great confidence in the vast opportunities ahead for this brand with wholesale sell-through increasing double digits in the first half.\nDTC delivering a sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2, maintaining a high-quality full-price business, a strong Spring/Summer '26 season order book and positive feedback from retailers on our Fall '26 product line. HOKA is a disruptive and transformational brand with the ability to further capture billions of incremental global market share dollars. Across both domestic and international markets, we'll continue to uphold our disciplined approach to marketplace management by building our DTC business and carefully exploring potential expansion into attractive wholesale channels and partnerships. We are committed to building sustainable growth for HOKA and are confident in the strategy we're executing to achieve this goal.\nAs we enter the second half of fiscal '26, our priorities are driving healthy sell-through and gaining market share, leveraging our enhanced DTC loyalty program to drive consumer engagement, preparing the marketplace for Spring '26 updates to Gaviota, Mark and Speedco franchises and investing in marketing to build global HOKA awareness.\nMoving on to the UGG brand. Global UGG revenue in the first half increased by 12% versus last year. [indiscernible] brands first half performance still consistent, fueled by our key brand initiatives. Top performing styles remained in line with our 365 focus. Men's footwear achieved growth at twice the rate of the overall brand, international regions accounted for the lion's share of our growth. We are especially encouraged by the consumer response to newer products and expanded franchises aligned to our men's and 365 initiatives, including the Mel franchise, which across sneaker, Chuck and Chelsea [indiscernible] has more than doubled versus last year in the first half.\nThe classic Micro, our most versatile derivative to the original classic boot, debuting as a top 5 style across DTC and wholesale, and also the Zora [indiscernible] flat in a unmistakable UGG version of the time of silhouette that is significantly outperforming our expectations in its first month since launch. While these products have driven positive sell-throughs, I would note that wholesale sell-in was the driver for total UGG brand performance in the first half, which includes benefits from earlier shipments that were carefully curated in alignment with our marketplace management strategy. These shipments have provided greater opportunities for consumers to discover UGG as wholesale points of distribution which we believe in combination with the shift to consumer shopping habits has put pressure on our DTC business near term.\nFrom a regional perspective, as anticipated, international markets are leading our growth, but we've seen a very strong order book conversion across all regions. The consumer response to our fall '25 collection has been very consistent globally with consumers gravitating towards fresh seasonal colors and transitional newness such as the classic micro stromal, Peak mod and Zora [indiscernible]. This quarter, these style saw gains as consumer preferred versatile buy now, wear now items.\nAs we prepare to ignite a season, our teams have created cohesive brand stories with our iconic style and iconic design global marketing campaigns, aiming to generate excitement and drive consumer engagement. In August, UGG's iconic from the first step campaign, featuring Stefan Diggs, Sara Jessica Parker and Founder, Brian Smith, to celebrate the brand's legacy. In September, UGG served as the official signing partner for highest [indiscernible] New York Fashion Week opening ceremony party aimed at building fashion credibility with influential [ mails ]. At the beginning of this month, to celebrate Paris Fashion Week, I took over the atrium of Gallery Lafayette to create a curated icons pop-up store. And tomorrow, UGG will launch an aspirational product collaboration with renowned Japanese fashion label, Takai. These brand activations help UGG brand generate momentum with consumers while at the same time, maintaining cultural relevance. And our team will continue to build upon the compelling content we've created to elevate the brand and amplify key seasonal product stories. I'm confident that the global marketplace is well positioned for UGG season. Thanks, everyone. I'll now pass it off to Steve to discuss our second quarter financial results and provide an update on fiscal year 2026.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Stefano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely proud of the results achieved in the second quarter and first half of our fiscal year 2026. For the second quarter, HOKA delivered more balanced growth across wholesale and DTC led by the strength of international and included sequential improvement in U.S. DTC compared to the prior quarter as we continue expanding the brand's presence to gain global awareness and market share. The UGG brand drove robust wholesale growth also led by the strength of international as we prepare the global marketplace for the brand's peak season. Our disciplined approach, flexible operating model and strong balance sheet continue to position us favorably in a dynamic marketplace as we head into the second half of our fiscal year 2026. We remain energized by the opportunities ahead for HOKA and UGG and look forward to further progress towards our long-term vision for these consumer-loved brands.\nNow let's get into the details of our second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal year 2026 revenue came in at $1.43 billion, representing an increase of 9% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by HOKA and UGG, which increased 11% and 10% versus last year, respectively, with small offset primarily from winding down stand-alone operations of smaller brands. For HOKA, wholesale remained the primary driver of growth, increasing 13% in the quarter as the brand continues to experience and healthy sell-through with innovative and compelling products that are resonating with consumers. HOKA DTC grew 8% versus last year, as international momentum carried through from the previous quarter, and we saw improvements in the U.S. business as anticipated.\nFor UGG, growth was driven by wholesale increasing 17% in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 10% decline in DTC. Wholesale strength was driven by strong demand from our retail partners, including earlier demand as well as European shipments that were pulled forward related to our upcoming third-party warehouse transition. UGG DTC was softer than anticipated as we have continued to experience pressures from better in-stock positions with our wholesale partners due to increased allocations delivered earlier in the year in an effort to match the demand that has continued to build in recent years, a more challenging macroeconomic environment for the U.S. consumers with shifts in consumer preference toward multi-brand in-store shopping experiences. Additionally, we believe these factors will continue to have an impact on growth in the second half.\nGross margin for the second quarter was 56.2%, up 30 basis points from last year's 55.9%. Second quarter gross margins compared to last year benefited from price increases, favorable product mix, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and factory cost sharing with partial offsets from incremental tariffs on U.S. goods and channel mix headwinds. As a result of our price increases being implemented at the beginning of July, in combination with actions to bring additional inventory in ahead of increased tariff rates being implemented, we saw a slight delay in the net headwind of tariffs and did not experience a meaningful negative impact in the second quarter compared to the prior year result. However, this is unique to the second quarter, and our expectation of net tariff headwinds in the back half of fiscal year remain largely unchanged.\nSG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was in line with expectations at $477 million, up 11% versus last year's $428 million as we continue investing in key areas of the business. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 33.4% versus last year's 32.7%. Our tax rate was 21.7%, which compares to 24% for the prior year as a result of onetime benefits recorded in the quarter. These results culminated in diluted earnings per share of $1.82 for the quarter, which is $0.23 above last year's $1.59 diluted earnings per share representing EPS growth of 14%. In terms of our second quarter performance relative to the guidance we provided in July, gross margin was the primary driver of EPS favorability. Again, the better-than-expected gross margin result was largely driven by favorable timing of tariff-related variables unique to the second quarter with benefits of our pricing actions flowing through in advance of the full burden from increased tariffs.\nTurning to our balance sheet at September 30, 2025. We ended September with $1.4 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $836 million, up 7% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $282 million worth of shares at an average price of $109.31. As of September 30, 2025, the company had approximately $2.2 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases.\nNow moving into our forward-looking update. We are now providing an outlook for our full year fiscal 2026 and expect total company revenue of approximately $5.35 billion with HOKA increasing by a low teens percentage versus last year and UGG growing in the range of a low to mid-single-digit percentage. Gross margin of approximately 56% as we anticipate headwinds from the impact of tariffs as this becomes material in the back half of this fiscal year, with partial offsets from our mitigation strategies and normalized levels of promotion in a more pressured macroeconomic environment. SG&A to be approximately 34.5% of revenue, reflecting our commitment to investing in the long-term opportunities of our powerful brands. This results in an expected operating margin of approximately 21.5%, which remains at a top-tier level of profitability relative to our peers. We are projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Finally, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.39. This guidance assumes a blended growth rate of approximately 9% from our 2 largest brands, as we have streamlined our brand portfolio to focus on our most profitable long-term opportunities and expect to yet again deliver record years for UGG and HOKA, each with annual revenues north of $2.5 billion and significantly contributing to our best-in-class profitability profile. Within this revenue guidance, we continue to expect international to outpace U.S. growth and global wholesale to outpace DTC for this fiscal year.\nOver the longer term, our focus remains to create a balanced business across regions and channels as we continue building our consumer base, bolstering connections with consumers through direct relationships and capturing incremental market share for years to come. Regarding tariffs, with timing-related favorability seen in the second quarter result, and our expectation of tariff impact in the second fiscal half largely unchanged, we now expect the unmitigated tariff impact on fiscal year 2026 to be approximately $150 million. Further, we now estimate that our mitigation efforts for this fiscal year will offset approximately $75 million to $95 million of this pressure, including benefits from select strategic and staggered pricing increases as well as partial cost sharing with factory partners.\nPlease note, this guidance excludes any unforeseen charges that may be considered nonrecurring to our ongoing business or impact from any future share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further updates to imposed tariffs or other global trade policy changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.\nOverall, our second quarter and first half fiscal year 2026 results illustrate the strong demand for our brands and strength of our disciplined model, giving us conviction to provide and achieve a compelling outlook for fiscal year 2026. We remain confident in the growth trajectory of our consumer love brands as our top-tier levels of profitability provide opportunities for targeted investments supported by our fortified balance sheet, all of which position us effectively to drive sustainable growth over the long term.\nThanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Stefano for his final remarks.\n\nStefano Caroti\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight that our brands have continued to perform very well through the first half of this fiscal year. More importantly, we remain committed to supporting and strategically managing our brands to ensure sustained long-term growth. We believe that both HOKA and UGG are well positioned across the global marketplace as we enter the holiday quarter and our teams are energized and hyper focused to deliver our full year guidance. HOKA has established itself as a prominent global performance brand, extending far beyond its disruptive origins. HOKA has just begin to realize its full potential and capability to innovate, and we are excited to continue building this transformational brand and UGG brand continues to inspire generations of consumers with its iconic products and its global appeal. This powerful brand has established a unique position in the marketplace with a strong loyal customer base and an ability to capture new audiences through compelling product evolution.\nThese 2 premium brands maintain a strong commitment to the original values, consistently creating purposeful products while adapting to the evolving demands of their respective global customer base. We're very excited about the opportunities ahead and we remain focused and disciplined on our approach to delivering long-term sustainable growth and value creation. I'd like to sincerely thank all of our valued employees across the Global Deckers team for their continued commitment to our collective success.\nThank you all for joining us today, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining today's call. Fiscal year 2026 is off to a solid start for Deckers. With HOKA and UGG, both outperforming the first quarter expectations we set forth on our year-end call.\nIn the first quarter, our brands gained market share while maintaining a high degree of full price integrity. HOKA delivered its largest quarter in its history, driving strong sell-throughs during this period of key model transitions. We continue to make disciplined and strategic investments in our brands and our teams tightly managed spend in other areas of the business to provide flexibility. This all led to Deckers delivering a great first quarter results, highlighted by revenue growing 17% versus last year to $965 million and diluted earnings per share increasing 24% to $0.93.\nThe strength of our business continues to be driven by the remarkable growth in our international markets with HOKA and UGG both contributing to Decker's 50% increase in international revenue, while navigating a choppy U.S. consumer environment.\nLooking at the global marketplace, our first quarter results demonstrate that HOKA and UGG remain 2 of the best-performing and most consumer-loved brands in our industry. We believe that Decker's key differentiator is our ability to build premium brands focused on authenticity, innovation and purpose. Our sustained track record of delivering healthy and profitable growth in challenging environments gives us confidence in navigating current uncertainties. And we believe that our brands and teams will continue to achieve long-term success.\nOur brands continue to be guided by the principles of consumer-first, elevating our products to exceed the expectation of consumers in a more competitive environment; brand-led, leveraging our unique brand codes to deliver a consistent brand experience as we target share gains across categories, seasons and product applications; innovation forward, challenging ourselves to create distinct styles with tangible consumer benefits; and globally driven, balancing our business across regions and channels.\nAs we build for the future, we believe these principles supported by the strength of our fundamentals and operational discipline will help us lead, adapt and grow in the rapidly evolving consumer landscape. Steve will provide further details on our first quarter financial results and an update on fiscal year '26. First, however, I'll share more details on brand performance and how we plan to execute the remainder of this year.\nStarting with HOKA. Global revenue in the first quarter increased 20% versus last year to $653 million. HOKA performance came in ahead of our expectations, but the shape of the brand's revenue growth versus last year was aligned with what we had anticipated as global wholesale increased 30%, driven primarily by the strength of international regions, with the U.S. also contributing to this growth. And DTC increased 3% globally with international regions maintaining their momentum, which was partially offset by ongoing pressure in the U.S. online channel as previously forecasted.\nAs you can see, the HOKA brand international business continues to drive exciting and broad-based growth across all regions in both DTC and wholesale. EMEA contributed the most meaningful incremental dollar growth as Europe recorded record quarterly wholesale reorders and DTC continued to be fueled by gains in consumer acquisition and retention. The APAC region is also delivering impressive growth, as HOKA further penetrates the market with mono-brand partner stores as well as own retail stores in China.\nIn the U.S., HOKA performance was in line with our expectations. Marketplace dynamics are generally playing out as anticipated amid key franchise upgrades, resulting in the brand experiencing a similar quarter relative to the one prior. From a U.S. wholesale perspective, performance continues to reflect our disciplined approach to marketplace management. HOKA is driving revenue growth from increased selling additional doors with key partners to satisfy greater in-store demand and reorders as sell-through in the channel continue to outpace revenue growth.\nThe HOKA brand's ongoing success with the wholesale channel highlights a continued shift in U.S. consumer shopping preferences toward in-person retail experiences. Our observations indicate that while consumers search for deals online brick-and-mortar stores remain the primary venue for full price sales, aligning with the feedback received from our retail partners. Our continued journey to thoughtull expand wholesale doors plays well into this marketplace dynamic, providing HOKA the opportunity to build share and strengthen partnerships with key customers.\nOn small scale, we also continue to selectively expand our own retail locations in key cities around the world, as we seek to build direct relationship with consumers and offer experiences that showcase the full breadth of the HOKA brands product offering. These strategies help HOKA gain visibility and solidify its position as the leading running brand in the U.S., although they create short-term pressure on DTC due to our limited retail presence and reliance on e-commerce.\nOver time, we expect our DTC business to benefit from the conversion of newly acquired consumers to loyal repeat purchases. In addition to the channel dynamics affecting HOKA. We have proactively identified opportunities for improved execution in response to evolving U.S. consumer trends.\nAs a relatively young brand, HOKA remains committed to applying insights gained from our experiences to drive future growth and development. Recognizing some of the execution challenges we faced over the last 6 months, we're implementing changes that include adjusting product life cycles to ensure a steady and balanced introduction of new products across key categories, time to coincide with major shopping periods, while providing greater separation between launch dates for our largest franchises. Tightening marketplace inventory targets an outgoing models ahead of product updates, and enhancing our HOKA DTC loyalty program to more effectively differentiate the DTC experience.\nIt will take time for the benefits of these actions to meaningfully impact our business, but we're confident that will ultimately improve the consumer experience and facilitate more seamless key franchise updates in the future. With respect to our current franchise upgrades, the consumer signals we're seeing for Bondi, Clifton and Arahi are quite positive. Bondi and Clifton are driving consistent and healthy sell-through in the global marketplace across channels and segments of distribution, evidenced by representing the top 2 running franchises in the U.S. according to Circana, driving very strong reorders and representing the top sellers among acquired and retained customers in EMEA and doubling year-over-year volumes in China for the spring/summer '25 season.\nBuilding up the success of Cristen and Bondi, the Arahi8 update has also been a success since launching at the beginning of this month. Early feedback in the U.S. has been very positive on the improved fit and feel, with particularly strong initial selling in the run specialty channel and DTC.\nEMEA has experienced double-digit weekly sell-throughs since launch. In China has seen significant volume gains on this model versus last year, performing well ahead of plan for the first 2 weeks of July. While still early, we're very pleased with initial results. The consumer is showing a strong affinity for the updates to the HOKA brand's 3 largest franchises. We continue to believe there is more work to be done to build the same heat in other franchises across our compelling product assortment. We believe the HOKA brand's point of differentiation to the consumer is its relentless focus on innovation that delivers transformational experiences.\nTo continue delivering the level of innovation consumers have come to expect from HOKA, we've bolstered capabilities across design, innovation, color and lifestyle, allowing for greater dedicated resources to enhance a broader range of styles. As a result, we're seeing tangible improvements to the product pipeline, which is reflected in the positive retailer response to our Spring/Summer '26 offering. We also expect to significantly enhance our ability to segment the marketplace with greater product ammunition allowing us to fuel DTC acquisition through differentiation and expand wholesale doors in a controlled manner as we continue to build awareness and broaden demand for the HOKA brand.\nTo that end, you may have seen that just a few weeks ago, HOKA launched its 2025 global brand campaign title Together, We Fly Higher. The campaign is centered around the power of community and the idea that individual progress is fueled by the collective. This is a principle HOKA has always embraced as we believe the HOKA community has really been the driving force behind building this transformational brand.\nTogether, We Fly Higher celebrates the unifying power of running highlighted in the new Anthem film and an inspiring series of short films, the spotlight real stories of runners. We'll amplify this campaign across retail stores, connected TV, out-of-home, digital and pit social across HOKA affiliated social media platforms.\nPersonally, I'm super excited about this campaign. I feel the brand has found its voice and this is the strongest HOKA campaign to date. Overall, fiscal '26 is off to a very good start for HOKA. Our 3 largest franchises are performing strongly with consumers, and we're expanding the brand's global reach, introducing HOKA footwear to a broader customer base.\nShifting to UGG. Global revenue in the first quarter increased 19% versus last year to $265 million. From a channel perspective, UGG outperformed wholesale, as wholesale increased 30% versus last year, with consistent growth across the U.S. and international regions. And DTC decreased 1%, with similar regional dynamics relative to HOKA, where we're seeing pressure in the U.S. related to consumer sentiment and in-store shopping preferences, offset by continued strong international growth momentum. The main drivers of our growth this quarter came from our focus areas. International drove the bulk of growth for UGG this quarter with demand in China contributing the largest year-over-year gains.\nMen's footwear grew at nearly twice the overall brand rate, and stand-alone sneaker styles drove most of the growth, reflecting the success of UGG's 365 initiative. Although Q1 is primarily a selling quarter for the brand, we're encouraged by the robust start in wholesale, a positive early indicator of consumer interest as partners look to accelerate shipments. UGG products continue to gain relevance during transitional periods reflecting the brand's ongoing success in developing collections that align with consumer preferences. Furthermore, we're particularly optimistic about the consistency of what has been working in key regions around the world.\nJet team has effectively implemented a brand-led global marketplace strategy, delivering elevated experiences through distinctive UGG products around the world. UGG brand focused on telling fewer, more targeted stories to amplify launches is demonstrating measurable success. The consumer response to the peak mod style is a perfect example of the team's efforts in driving positive results. The Peak mod is a completely human-specific clock that takes design queues from popular UGG styles. It initially soft launched in March on the heels of our first-ever men's focused spring marketing campaign, it was then featured as part of our seasonal icons Imagine marketing campaign. This versatile style quickly became a male consumer favorite across the U.S., EMEA and China, even earning placement in major fashion publications as they go to style for more and more that tire.\nWe believe there are 4 key reasons for the success. Infusing UGG brand codes into a versatile design, leveraging consumer insights early and frequently, continue to edit the assortment to allow for more focused seasonal stories and pursuing a long-term strategy to acquire more male consumers. With respect to our 365 initiative, UGG achieved strong global growth within the sandal and stinker segments through the following: the Golden collection, which generated significant consumer interest, particularly in the new Golden Star Glide and Villa styles that commanded higher retail prices compared to existing silhouettes In the Low melt franchise, which effectively blends the distinctive UGG aesthetic and comfort with adaptable wearability. As we move into late summer and early fall, despite ongoing concerns affecting the U.S. consumer sentiment, the UGG brand is strategically positioned within the global marketplace to achieve growth in the second half of calendar year '25. To provide more context, we have operated with lean marketplace inventory for the TAS franchise maintain scarcity ahead of its core selling season. In addition, UGG would be launching its iconic design campaign to build heat and generate buzz for versatile footwear in advance for UGG season with activation planned in key cities around the world.\nUGG begins this transitional period with 3 key product stories, leveraging its iconic mustard seed colorway on key styles, including the Lowell sneaker, UGG break Clog and all new classic micro. Early feedback on all 3 styles is very positive, and we anticipate more exciting UGG launches this fall. The UGG team executed the first quarter very well, reinforcing our confidence in achieving another strong year for this powerful brand.\nWith that, I'll now hand over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter results as well as our updated thoughts around fiscal year 2026.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Stefano, and good afternoon, everyone. Deckers again delivered another quarter of strong results that came in above our expectations for the first quarter. As Stefano outlined, both HOKA and UGG experienced significant growth in the quarter with the wholesale channel being the primary driver. For HOKA, sell-in was strong as sell-through in the wholesale channel was very healthy. In addition, international DTC delivered robust growth as we continue to build brand awareness and grow market share.\nFor UGG, growth was also driven by the wholesale channel as the brand experienced success with versatile year-round styles refilled depleted inventory levels and started fulfilling fall order books. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues, our teams are directly engaged to drive improvements across our business, identifying and implementing actions that are aligned with and have the ability to bolster our long-term strategic opportunities.\nWe believe our disciplined operating model and strong financial framework positions us well to remain nimble and react appropriately to further changes in the dynamic consumer environment. We are excited about the tremendous growth opportunity ahead for both HOKA and UGG and we'll continue to build upon the rock-solid foundation we have set over the last few years.\nWith that, let's get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2026 results. Total company revenue was $965 million, up 17% versus the prior year. HOKA drove the majority of incremental dollar volume, adding $108 million of revenue versus last year to deliver record quarterly revenue of $653 million. UGG drove its largest June ended quarter in history, contributing an incremental $42 million to deliver $265 million of first quarter revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.8%, which is down 110 basis points from last year's 56.9%. As compared to last year, first quarter gross margin was impacted by unfavorable channel mix with wholesale growing faster than DTC, increased promotion across UGG and HOKA as we anticipated and higher freight rates, with partial offsets from favorable product mix, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nSG&A dollar spend in the first quarter was $373 million, which is up 11% from last year's $337 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 38.6% versus 40.9% in the prior year, with leverage driven by favorable timing of certain expenses and onetime benefits in the quarter. SG&A dollar growth compared to last year was driven by investment in key areas of the business in support of our growth initiatives, which includes higher marketing spend for HOKA and UGG, increased warehouse costs as we transitioned our EMEA third-party logistics provider and greater rent expense resulting from select retail store expansion.\nOur tax rate was 24%, which was slightly higher than last year's 22.5% due to onetime discrete tax items. These results, coupled with a lower share count as the result of our share repurchase program and higher interest income, net of higher tax rate drove diluted earnings per share of $0.93 for the quarter which compares to $0.75 in the prior year period, representing growth of 24%.\nIn terms of our first quarter performance, relative to the high end of our guidance provided in May, revenue came in approximately $55 million above expectations, driven by approximately $25 million of earlier HOKA wholesale shipments, largely related to our international business as we transition certain warehousing operation for the EMEA region.\nApproximately $15 million of incremental wholesale reorders for HOKA related to strong sell-through and approximately $15 million of UGG wholesale shipments from an earlier shift into Q1 from planned in Q2.\nGross margin came in approximately 130 basis points better than expected, primarily due to product mix benefits and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A grew slower than we anticipated, primarily due to favorable timing of certain expenses and onetime items, including a larger benefit from FX remeasurement. All resulting in a diluted earnings per share coming in approximately $0.26 above guidance with better performance contributing approximately $0.15 of favorability and timing contributing approximately $0.11 of favorability.\nWe did not experience a material impact from tariffs in the first quarter because the majority of products sold was either already in inventory or shipped prior to tariffs taking effect. In addition, we implemented selective initial price increases, which went into effect on July 1 and provided no meaningful benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, we plan to phase in product price increases over the course of fiscal year 2026. So the associated margin benefit intended to partially offset tariff headwinds would not align precisely with the timing of tariff-driven increases in the cost of goods sold.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2025, we ended June with $1.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $849 million, up 13% versus the same point in time last year, and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $183 million worth of shares at an average price per share of $109.84. As of June 30, 2025, the company had approximately $2.4 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\nNow moving into our forward-looking update. Given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty related to the global trade policy and difficulty predicting impact on the consumer environment and purchasing behavior, we are not providing a formal outlook for fiscal year 2026. However, I want to reiterate the key themes of our business and framework for fiscal year 2026.\nAs a reminder, our fiscal year 2026 framework includes the following: From a revenue perspective, we expect HOKA to continue as our fastest-growing brand, UGG continuing to grow, international to outpace U.S. growth and wholesale to outpace DTC in the near term. From a gross margin perspective, we expect a year-over-year decline from headwinds that include increased tariffs, higher levels of promotion, upgraded materials on key styles and higher ocean freight rates in the first half. We believe these headwinds can be partially offset by selective and staggered price increases in the U.S. and partial cost sharing with factory partners.\nOn the SG&A front, we will continue to tightly manage our expenses and drive efficiencies, but we may deliver a short-term increase in our SG&A expense ratio to revenue as we take advantage of our unique ability to invest in our brands for the longer term. Overall, this should lead us to a lower operating margin relative to our record 23.6% delivered in fiscal year 2025. With a normalized consumer environment, we believe we have the ability to deliver leverage in the coming years.\nOn tariffs, we are still awaiting final details, but based on the recent updates, assuming Vietnam increases from 10% to 20%, we would expect to face a total of $185 million of unmitigated impact to our cost of goods sold in fiscal year 2026, up from our previously provided estimate of up to $150 million. As we said last quarter, we put in measures to recapture up to approximately $75 million and we'll continue to evaluate additional levers for potential further mitigation.\nOne of our mitigating levers is price adjustments. Since our last call, the majority of these have been communicated, and I would note that we have not seen any material changes to our order book resulting from these increases.\nSimilar to our approach last quarter, as we continue to operate in a period of elevated macro uncertainty, we will be providing an outlook for the quarter ending September 30. For the second quarter of our fiscal year 2026, we expect revenue in the range of $1.38 billion to $1.42 billion, with HOKA increasing approximately 10% reflecting our earlier Q1 wholesale shipments and UGG increasing at least mid-single digits.\nGross margin is expected to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%, which is down versus the prior year, primarily due to increased tariffs for goods shipped into the U.S., increased promotional activity as we lap exceptionally low levels in the prior year and higher freight costs expensed relative to last year's low levels that we signaled would be not sustainable with partial offsets from our initial price increases that went into effect on July 1.\nSG&A is expected to be approximately 33.5% of revenue as we continue investing in brand building marketing and diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 as compared to last year's $1.59. Overall, the performance of our brands in the first quarter gives us further confidence in our ability to continue to grow these brands. We are operating from a position of strength as our in-demand brands resonate with consumers worldwide, and we remain driven by our long-term focus. Our top-tier levels of profitability free cash flow and debt-free balance sheet allow us to continue fueling the long-term opportunities ahead while maintaining an ability to adapt to evolving dynamics.\nThanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Stefano for his final remarks.\n\nStefano Caroti\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. As we've just covered, our brands are off to a solid start in fiscal '26. Both HOKA and UGG delivered growth above expectations for Q1 and above the full year growth rates we are targeting prior to tariff uncertainty. Of course, we're mindful that consumers are just beginning to feel the impact of higher prices. It will remain nimble to react to changes in the consumer environment, but we're encouraged by the current momentum of our brands.\nThough the vast majority of our year is still to come, our confidence in these brands remains high, given the performance the momentum of the business as we see it today. The opportunities ahead are immense. HOKA and UGG continue to create distinctive products they uniquely resonate with consumers, and both have significant potential to gain market share in growing global segments. We continue to challenge ourselves to compete with our own success, building our innovation pipeline to fuel our powerful brands and stay ahead of the competition.\nAs we continue navigating this period of uncertainty, we lead on our strong fundamentals to position our brands for long-term success. I want to thank our dedicated global team for their continued efforts to exit our strategy as we create the future for Deckers.\nThank you all for joining us today, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued support.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

It's great to be here with you today to discuss our superb third quarter, the largest and most profitable in Deckers' history. UGG and HOKA continued to drive our success, as both brands are creating unique and innovative products with purpose that are increasingly embraced by consumers worldwide.\nHighlights of our record third quarter performance include revenue growing 17% over last year to $1.8 billion, gross margins improving to 60.3% and diluted earnings per share increasing 19% to $3. We are very proud of the exceptional quarter just completed, thanks to the hard work of our global teams. I want to especially recognize employees supporting our distribution centers, retail stores, customer and consumer experience, e-commerce, marketing, planning and allocation, merchandising and sales, who collectively contributed to the successful execution of our largest quarter ever.\nOnce again, our brands were able to maintain a high degree of full-price business while competing with more promotional brand in the global marketplace, choosing to prioritize brand health. As we continue to manage and build our brands and business for the long term, we're even more encouraged by what Deckers has delivered over the last 9 months. Our fiscal year-to-date performance, as compared to last year, includes significant revenue growth in key areas, with HOKA increasing 29%, UGG growing 15%, international markets rising 28% and balance increases of 19% across the DTC and wholesale channels.\nThe shape of our growth and evolution of our business is directly tied to our long-term strategies and guiding principles, which provide the foundation for how we manage our brands to maintain a [ pull ] model of demand. Overall, Deckers' third quarter and fiscal year-to-date performance has exceeded our expectations. Our increased revenue outlook for fiscal '25 now calls for 15% growth, which would be our fifth consecutive year of growing mid-teens or higher. Steve will provide further details on third quarter performance and this updated outlook later in the call.\nBut before that, I will share brand highlights from the third quarter. Starting with UGG. Global revenue in the third quarter increased 16% versus last year to $1.2 billion. From a channel perspective, UGG delivered balanced revenue growth of 16% versus last year across both direct-to-consumer and wholesale. DTC channel highlights in the third quarter include strong growth across our global markets, gains with new and existing consumers, as the brand experienced double-digit increases in both acquisition and retention, a 25% increase in UGG Reward members and encouraging progress for UGG Men's, with growth outpacing total brand growth in the channel.\nIn the wholesale channel, UGG experienced growth across all regions, with the majority of the increased revenue coming from international markets. Close partnerships with influential retailers continue to elevate the UGG brand and enhance global exposure with target consumers. During the third quarter, I collaborated to create special [ corner shop ] takeovers with Selfridges in London and Nordstrom in New York City. Both of these partnerships were activated with on-site events and media that drove great brand buzz and connections with consumers. Across the global wholesale marketplace, we believe that UGG was a top-performing brand in the holiday quarter, highlighted by exceptional levels of full price sell-through that drove healthy margins for our partners and lean inventory in the channel exiting the month of December. We believe the UGG brand's success around the world results from a purposeful product assortment that is informed by consumer insights and infused with UGG brand codes. This approach has driven consistent product performance throughout the fiscal year with progress in key segments, including [ ICOS reimagined ], with the Tasman and Ultra Mini franchises continuing to experience strong global adoption from consumers.\n[ High view ] versatility as the emerging Golden and Lowell collections experienced rapid sellouts, while the Weather Hybrid collection more than doubled versus the prior year, a new Winter lifestyle highlighted by the [ Mini Dipper's ] success in the U.S. and EMEA. The UGG team continues to build brand heat and relevance through powerful collaborations. During the quarter, I was able to reach a new audience and elevate the in-line assortment through the release of 2 highly sought-after collaborations with Los Angeles-based fashion brand Gallery Department and U.K.-based [ skate brand Palace ]. These partnerships featured iconic styles, such as the Tasman and the Ultra Mini, which gained global exposure from being spotted on influential professional athletes and music superstars. The success of these iconic styles is closely linked to the emerging hybrid styles in the assortment.\nThe Goldenstar Clog continued to see strong global growth in the quarter, and we saw consumers in the U.S. and in Europe embrace the Lowell as a lifestyle sneaker, lending the style in the UGG brand's top 10 during the third quarter. Adding to our enthusiasm for the [ X sneaker ] success, we've just added sizing for men's and kids and also launched a companion style, the [ Low Lowmel ], that hits lower to the ankle and is built with greater versatility for warmer months. In other hybrid collection that performed well in the quarter was the UGG brand's weatherized hybrids, featured as part of our men's focused marketing campaign starting Post Malone. This campaign drove significant increases in search and engagement, with over 3 billion impressions in the U.S. alone for both the product collection and the UGG brand overall.\nThrough high impact out-of-home content, media placement with Amazon Thursday Night Football, ESPN and Spotify and a 10-day experiential field house retail pop-up store that culminated with a VIP performance by Post Malone, this campaign represents great progress in our journey to increase connections with male consumers around the world, even propelling the Tasman with a hybrid to become the UGG brand's #1 men's style in China this past quarter, a region where the brand continues to make solid headway.\nAt the same time, we're seeing strong adoption of our UGG Men's product among professional athletes, a group that often shapes the future of fashion. Altogether, this was a splendid quarter for UGG, as the brand continues to perform in a league of its own. Heading into the final stretch of fiscal '25, UGG is delivering on the objectives we set for the year, with balanced growth across channels driven by outsized growth from international markets and maintain strength in the U.S. We believe this special brand can continue to deliver sustainable growth through distinctive and ownable category segments that are uniquely UGG. Congratulations to Anne and her entire UGG team on these amazing accomplishments and the bright future ahead.\nAs UGG has continued to solidify its positioning as a leading global lifestyle brand, I would like to provide an update regarding the Koolaburra brand. To maintain focus on our most significant organic opportunities, we're planning to phase out the Koolaburra brand stand-alone product collections and operations. As part of this change, we expect to sunset koolaburra.com at the end of this fiscal year and wind down Koolaburra in the wholesale channel throughout the calendar year 2025. We'll provide a more complete update on this forthcoming change during our earning call in May as part of our forward-looking guidance for fiscal year 2026.\nOkay. Shifting to the HOKA brand. Global revenue in the third quarter increased 24% versus last year to $531 million. From a channel perspective, HOKA delivered impressive revenue growth versus last year throughout the global marketplace as DTC increased 27% with strong growth across every region and wholesale grew 21%, primarily driven by outside increases from international distributor markets as we prepare the marketplace for upcoming key franchise upgrades. HOKA DTC channel highlights in the quarter include accelerated growth in the APAC region, with China contributing the largest incremental dollar revenue of all international regions, persisting gains in consumer acquisition and retention, the latter of which was particularly strong, indicating a high degree of loyalty from existing consumers and increased mix of business from trail categories, which drove outsized growth in part due to the introduction of the [ Kaha Frost ] weather collection. The [ Kaha Frost ] collection features the HOKA brand's first cold-weather ready styles, including a $280 hiking boot and $200 slipper moccasin, both of which are trail-ready with [ Vibram ] mega grip outsole. The consumer response was excellent around the globe, driving impressive sell-throughs and generating great breadth for the brand, including being named the Best Multifunctional Hiking Shoe of 2024 by [ GOGO ] Shanghai, an influential annual publication of lifestyle awards in China, and a Must Have Item for a Week in the Mountains by [ Tian Vogue ].\nIn the wholesale channel, our primary focus during the quarter was to set the stage for the Bondi 9 launch by moving through existing inventory of the Bondi 8 while also driving high full price sell-throughs across the lineup of innovative products we've introduced throughout the year. As brand awareness and consumer appetite for HOKA continues to build, we're excited to be adding select doors with our strategic partners worldwide in conjunction with the start of our Spring 2025 season.\nDuring the third quarter, the HOKA team did an outstanding job in driving consumer engagement with the brand through events and activations around the world. Key global moments included HOKA being the second most warm brand at the Foot Locker Cross Country High School Natural Championships in the U.S., hosting HOKA Fly Lab experiences at the Frankfurt Marathon Germany and the [ RM 73 ] World Championships in [ Taupo ], New Zealand, and producing a benchmark consumer experience at the Shanghai Marathon, where HOKA was the fifth most worn brand.\nAs you can tell, our marketing teams are working hard to maintain and build performance credibility while growing global brand awareness through activations in key cities. The HOKA brand's [ Shukan ] achievements are made possible by the HOKA product team's laser focus to build product solutions that deliver transformational experiences for consumers around the world. HOKA has 2 exciting products launching in the fourth quarter, which are the Bondi 9 and a 2.0 update to our fastest and most technically advanced race shoe, the Cielo X1. Having just launched a couple of weeks ago, we are very pleased with the early consumer response to the Bondi 9, with the new premium midsole, increased [ tacit ], its 3D molded collar, this franchise has been upgraded from top to bottom, providing a soft, yet resilient ride for everyday miles. The Bondi 9 release is the HOKA brand's most globally integrated launch to date, supported and enhanced by our Everybody Bondi marketing campaign with out-of-home content on high-traffic displays in key cities around the world, a Bondi 9-week fitness challenge that culminates in participants completing a 9-mile run, partnering with local and global influencers, including decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast Suni Lee, and activations at regional and global events such as the Miami Marathon, Paris Half Marathon and London Winter Run.\nWhile the Bondi 9 represents a significant upgrade to 1 of our most accessible franchises, we've also enhanced our pinnacle ratio, the Cielo X1, making it faster and smoother for the highest-performing athletes. In the 2.0 version of the Cielo X1, we've tweaked the rocker and geometry to provide greater stability without adding weight, enabling greater speed through the toe transition. Commercially available in February, this is a shoe that we have been testing with our athletes for months now and have high hopes to see on podiums in the future.\nHOKA has an exciting future ahead with a strong pipeline of new innovations and a growing global marketplace to serve the brand's increasing demand. Thanks, everyone. I'll now hand it over to Steve to detail our third quarter financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year '25 guidance.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Stefano, and good afternoon, everyone. Our record third quarter performance illustrates the continued strength and robust momentum of the UGG and HOKA brands. As Stefano mentioned, UGG delivered another exceptional quarter of results as the brand attracts and maintains consumers around the world with a relevant and elevated product assortment. HOKA continues to deliver solid controlled global growth as the brand builds market share with performance products that consumers love. Our team's disciplined long-term approach to managing these brands' respective global marketplaces supports our pull model while sustaining exceptional levels of full price selling.\nOur results this quarter again demonstrate the power of our model and disciplined marketplace management. Maintaining this flexible operating model, we will continue to build these incredible brands with long-term health top of mind. Now let's get to the details of our third quarter results. Third quarter fiscal 2025 revenue was $1.83 billion, representing an increase of 17% versus the prior year on a reported and constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by UGG increasing 16% versus last year, delivering record quarterly revenue of $1.24 billion, with particularly strong demand captured later in the quarter as we maintained favorable inventory on key styles relative to the prior year and consistent strength across the HOKA brand's global marketplace, with HOKA growing 24% versus last year to deliver quarterly revenue of $531 million.\nFurther on UGG, I would note that the brand experienced a strong December selling period relative to our last year. Our increased and earlier inventory position aided our ability to fulfill orders during the third quarter on key styles compared to the prior year. Recall that in the third quarter of last year, we sold out of key styles that were later fulfilled in Q4. While this dynamic was a tailwind to our third quarter performance this year, it is highly likely to have an adverse comparison impact on the UGG brand's current quarter.\nGross margin for the third quarter was 60.3%, up 160 basis points from last year's 58.7%. Third quarter gross margin benefited from favorable product mix, primarily due to higher-margin products within UGG driving a larger percentage of growth, reduced closeouts to the wholesale channel, higher levels of full price selling for UGG and a small benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange rates, with partial offsets from higher freight costs and an increased discounting for HOKA as anticipated, primarily related to preparing the marketplace for key model upgrade.\nWhile we are proud to deliver this record gross margin, I would caution that the extremely high levels of full price selling and very low levels of wholesale closeouts are abnormal and not something we would normally expect to repeat going forward. Further, though we experienced a small revenue and gross margin benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the third quarter, we have since seen rates move against us, and as a result, expect to face an FX headwind in the upcoming quarter.\nSG&A dollar spend in the third quarter was $535 million, up 25% versus last year's $429 million as we continue investing in key areas of the business. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 29.3%, which is above last year's rate of 27.5%, primarily driven by increased marketing spend, unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, and higher headcount across strategic growth areas of the business.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, which compares to 21.9% for the prior year. These results culminated in diluted earnings per share of $3 for the quarter, which is $0.48 above last year's $2.52 diluted earnings per share, representing EPS growth of 19%.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2024, we ended December with $2.2 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $577 million, up 7% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $45 million worth of shares at an average price of $162.85. As of December 31, 2024, the company had approximately $641 million remaining authorized for share repurchase.\nNow moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2025. Based on the strong demand experienced in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue expectations to just above $4.9 billion, which equates to approximately 15% growth, which compares to our prior guidance for growth of approximately 12%. From a brand standpoint, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, up from our prior expectations of mid-single digits as a result of stronger global demand. And with continued execution against our full year expectation, we still expect HOKA to increase approximately 24% versus last year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we acknowledge that with only 1 quarter left in our fiscal year, this provides visibility into our anticipated fourth quarter growth expectations. And we realized that while we have increased our full year guidance, this update highlights distorted growth rates implied in the fourth quarter for our 2 largest brands, each for unique reasons.\nFor the UGG brand, as planned, our improved product in-stock positioning versus the prior year allowed us to satisfy incremental consumer demand during our third quarter. While in the prior year, we ran low on product availability and continue to catch up to fulfill demand through Q4 last year. This year, we believe this demand was captured in Q3. Given how strong UGG has performed year-to-date, we are limited in the fourth quarter by available inventory left to sell.\nFor HOKA, our guidance implies the fourth quarter to be the largest volume quarter for the brand ever. This is on top of last year's fourth quarter that included a significant amount of sell-in to wholesale accounts related to door expansion as we set up fiscal year 2025. And while this creates some year-on-year variations in the quarterly growth rates, we are still on track to achieve an annual growth rate of 24%. Then, with the strong gross margin achieved in the third quarter, we are increasing our full year expectation to now be at or slightly better than 57% as we recognize the exceptional levels of full price selling UGG achieved in the third quarter and continued product mix benefits but maintain our expectation for continued freight headwinds and a more promotional and closeout environment in the balance of the year as compared to last year's unusually low levels, and as mentioned, a headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the fourth quarter.\nSG&A is still expected to be approximately 35%, aligned with our commitment to continue investing responsibly to support the long-term sustainable growth of our business. With these adjustments, we now expect an operating margin of approximately 22%. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. And as a result of our improved revenue and gross margin expectation, we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectations to now be in the range of $5.75 to $5.80. Please note, this guidance excludes any unforeseen charges that may be considered nonrecurring to our ongoing business or impact from any future share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties that may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.\nWe are proud of the outstanding third quarter and year-to-date results that our brands have delivered thus far in fiscal year 2025. As our guidance for the full fiscal year indicates, we expect to report Deckers' fifth consecutive year of double-digit top line revenue growth while continuing to deliver top-tier levels of operating profitability. I remain confident in our in-demand brands, which benefit from our flexible model and robust financial profile that we believe continue to position us well to drive sustainable growth over the long term. With that, I'll now hand the call back to Stefano for his final remarks.\n\nStefano Caroti\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. This was truly a special quarter, highlighting the strength of our industry-leading brands. UGG and HOKA continued to drive consistent full price growth through the purposeful creation of relevant, distinct and innovative products that are meeting the demands of our consumers who are discovering our products in a well-managed global marketplace. I'm confident that we'll continue to execute our strategy in the fourth quarter to close another great year for Deckers.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '26, our teams have set the foundation for continued growth with an exciting pipeline of products to come. We remain dedicated to our long-term strategies of building HOKA to become a leading performance brand through disruptive innovation, growing UGG through the evolution of iconic franchises and the creation of new icons, expanding our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and increasing our international business through the implementation of our successful domestic playbook.\nAs we execute against these strategies, we remain committed to maintaining our financial discipline to deliver top-tier levels of profitability, and we'll continue to be guided by our consumer-first mindset, brand-led philosophy, emphasis on innovation and globally driven approach. On behalf of our management team, I want to express our sincere gratitude to all of our employees for their continued efforts to build the future of Deckers. Thank you all for joining us today, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm glad to be here today to discuss our strong start to fiscal year 2025. With this being my final call before I pass the torch to Stefano, at the end of the month, I am confident that the Deckers team has laid the groundwork to deliver another year of excellent results as they build for the future of this amazing company.\nSpecifically, Deckers first quarter performance is highlighted by revenue growing 22% versus last year to $825 million, gross margin improving to 56.9% and diluted earnings per share increasing 87% versus last year to $4.52. Importantly, this quarter's results were closely aligned with our objectives for fiscal year 2025 as HOKA was our main growth driver, increasing 30% versus last year to $545 million, UGG increased 14% versus last year as it continues to build year-round relevancy with consumers through iconic products. Both DTC and wholesale increased above 20% versus last year, as our brands captured healthy demand across the global marketplace and international regions increased 21% versus last year, led by robust DTC growth. These incredible results, which include some unique benefits specific to the first quarter, give us confidence that we can deliver the increased profitability reflected in our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2025. Steve will provide further details on our updated outlook later in the call. But first, I will share some of the brand highlights from our first quarter before turning it over to our Chief Commercial Officer and incoming CEO, Stefano Caroti to review channel performance.\nStarting with the brand highlights. Global HOKA revenue in the first quarter increased 30% versus last year to a quarterly record of $545 million. HOKA performance was driven by the brand's compelling product assortment, including new launches, which experienced strong demand across the brand's global marketplace. More specifically, top styles like the Clifton and Bondi continued to experience healthy growth emerging franchises like the Mach, Transport and Kawana drove outsized gains and new styles like the Skyward X, Cielo X1 and Skyflow brought incremental volume and attention to the brand through segmentation and greater innovation.\nDiving into our top styles, gateway products, such as Clifton and Bondi remain the leading franchises for HOKA. The brand continues to build demand for these popular franchises through distribution segmentation as the introduction of model updates increasingly allow for differentiation of key partners to satisfy incremental demand and limited edition lifestyle treatments and collaborations that regularly sell out offering unique versions of these hero styles.\nIn terms of emerging HOKA franchises, I want to start by highlighting the Mach 6 launch, which has been a universal success. This redesigned and upgraded Mach has experienced strong sell-through across the global marketplace, resulting in the Mach being a top 5 revenue style for HOKA in Q1. Thus far, we are encouraged by the consumer adoption of the Mach, which is skewing younger and driving considerable acquisition in the U.S. and EMEA. We believe the expansive consumer demand we're seeing from the Mach is attributable to the fantastic work of the HOKA product and merchandising team who designed the collection with color and branding variations that allow for greater differentiation across points of distribution.\nRegarding Transport and Kawana, we continue to see these styles perform well in our DTC channel and with our lifestyle athletic partners. Both styles saw explosive growth in the quarter, landing them in the HOKA brand's top 10 styles ranked by revenue. While the Transport and Kawana were designed as a light hiker and fitness shoe respectively, the consumer is increasingly adopting them for more casual and versatile were.\nOn the innovation front, the HOKA brand's most advanced performance-leading styles, the Cielo X1 and Skywood X have far outperformed our expectations. These groundbreaking styles were featured as part of the HOKA Fly Lab experience, which was celebrated at worldwide events such as the Boston Marathon, Big Sur International Marathon, Hackney Half Marathon in London and the Tokyo Marathon. The Skywood X in particular, has been a key focus of our marketing efforts as it reinforces the HOKA brands origins and leadership position in Mach's cushion performance. The success of innovative styles like the Cielo and Skyward is critical to HOKA maintaining its performance roots and emboldens the product team to continue pushing the envelope of our technologies. The Skyflow, which only launched about 10 days ago, is also an all-new style focused on innovation, but at a much more commercial price point within the HOKA brands product range. This exciting style, which combines premium Skywood X-inspired geometry with upgraded foam compounds, creating an elevated experience for daily runs. As part of our segmentation efforts, the Skyflow is developed as a co-exclusive for our DTC and our run specialty partners, continuing to elevate the HOKA brand's everyday performance lineup while differentiating its global marketplace. We are receiving great feedback from consumers and our retail partners in the early days of this launch. The strength of performance across the HOKA product lineup is amplified by the continued evolution of the brand's global marketplace. During the first quarter, HOKA drove balanced growth across channels with DTC revenue increasing 33% versus last year and wholesale revenue increasing 28% versus last year.\nFrom a DTC perspective, HOKA continues to experience global gains through consumer acquisition and retention with particular strength among retained consumers in the first quarter. We believe this is a powerful reflection of HOKA consumer loyalty, reinforcing the long runway we see for this brand and the reason we are focused on building the HOKA brand's awareness while there remain significant opportunity. Part of our approach to building HOKA brand awareness is through expanded points of distribution with key partners. During the quarter, we added strategic doors with select partners around the world, which contributed to HOKA wholesale growth in the quarter. We also continued adding shelf space and gaining market share as the brand refilled inventory in the channel and continue to see high levels of full price sell-through.\nOutside of adding new distribution, HOKA is building awareness through its global marketing campaign. The latest chapter of the HOKA brand's FLY HUMAN FLY campaign launched on July 1, with the new film Birds Eye, which brings to life the brand's origin story and captures the exhilaration and joy of movement. The film is the centerpiece of a 360-degree integrated brand campaign, inclusive of Connected TV, out-of-home content social and earned media and in-person community activations in key cities. All of the elements of the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign are aimed at deepening connections with consumers, inspiring brand love and introducing new consumers to HOKA around the world. We are really proud of this elevated campaign, and I hope you all check out the Birds Eye film when you have a chance. Overall, this quarter was an excellent start to the year for HOKA with healthy full-price demand across global markets. The team is laser-focused on executing the brand strategy to build global brand awareness and market share with an enhanced focus on international markets, expand DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains, and excite consumers with performance innovations.\nShifting to UGG. Global UGG revenue in the first quarter increased 14% versus last year to $223 million. Performance in the quarter was driven by strong full price selling of key iconic franchises with increased year-round momentum, increased adoption of the expanded golden collection, continued momentum in global DTC and robust wholesale growth in the U.S., reflecting earlier demand. We are encouraged by the consumer demand for UGG in the first quarter as we believe it reflects continued progress and creating year-round excitement for the brand's versatile and seasonally relevant product. The UGG product team has done a fantastic job building product with purpose that is consumer-informed champions UGG brand codes and has increased wearing occasions, allowing the brand to build and sustain demand over longer periods of time. This is best evidenced by the continued D-RAN adoption of the Tasman franchise as well as the growth being driven by an expanded golden collection. The UGG brand's ability to drive continued strong selling for the Tasman's franchise speaks to the power of its thoughtful management across the global marketplace, versatility of styling and the marketing activations that preserve its relevance in the mind of our consumers. Specifically on the marketing front, UGG has collaborated with various brands and designers to create exclusive versions of Tasman franchise styles. During the first quarter, our upcoming Tasman collaboration with Chinese born London-based designer Feng Chen Wang was featured as part of her Spring/Summer 2025 collection, unveiling at Paris Fashion Week. Her collection and -- and in particular, the Tasman collaboration, was featured across influential fashion and cultural publications, including Vogue, Hypebeast and Highsnobiety. The UGG team's ability to maintain consumer interest through exciting marketing activations and collaborations is also benefiting newer franchises like the Golden Collection. The increase in consumer demand for this collection led to an expansion of silhouettes in the current year, which performed extremely well. Of the UGG brand's top 10 styles in the first quarter ranked by revenue, 4 came from the Golden Collection, 2 of which were new to the brand this year. The Tasman franchise in Golden Collection were also key drivers of the UGG brand DTC success in the first quarter, which was equally strong in the U.S. and international regions. The UGG brand's more focused assortment of relevant franchises is driving the majority of consumer demand, which contributed to lower promotion as compared to prior first quarters, where the DTC business has historically been more influenced by end of season discounting on seasonal colors. While this dynamic is not expected to continue throughout fiscal year 2025, we do think it speaks to the strength of the brand and its ability to maintain year-round demand. UGG has exciting things ahead with the upcoming launch of its fields like UGG global marketing campaign, which features a dynamic group of creators who have booked the ethos of UGG. The fields like UGG campaign will come to life across the brand's global marketplace through social media, in-store events and multisensory community activations that promote self-expression and a connected community. The brand is on track to deliver another year of healthy growth with premium products and elevated experiences that enhance our consumer connections. Both UGG and HOKA are off to strong starts in fiscal year 2025 and are well positioned to continue capturing high levels of consumer demand for the remainder of this year and beyond.\nBefore passing off to Steve, I want to give Stefano an opportunity to review Deckers excellent channel performance in the first quarter. As all of you know, Stefano will becoming Deckers next CEO on August 1. I'm excited to welcome him today to speak on one of the areas he has been successfully leading for some time now in his current capacity as our Chief Commercial Officer. Stefano?\n\nStefano Caroti\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThanks, David. It's great to be here with you all today and share Deckers channel highlights within the global marketplace. Before having in, I want to thank Dave for his thoughtful and lighten leadership over the last 8 years, and in particular, the mentorship provided over the last 6 months. Dave has been an extremely valuable resource for me throughout the transition, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to lead Deckers on our continued exciting journey ahead.\nDiving into channel performance in the quarter. Our results continue to reflect Deckers successful global marketplace management that has maintained a pull model of consumer demand, driving high levels of full price selling. This year, we signaled a much more balanced growth story between our DTC and wholesale channels which was well executed in the first quarter. For the quarter, global DTC increased 24% versus last year on a reported basis and 22% on a comparable basis. HOKA drove the majority of gains in the DTC channel, but we also saw positive contributions from the UGG brand.\nFrom a regional standpoint, DTC growth was robust across international regions and within the U.S., which increased 31% and 21%, respectively. Among international regions, growth was most meaningful in China and EMEA as both drove strong increases online and benefited from successful recent retail store openings. Regarding wholesale, global revenues increased 21% versus last year. Similar to DTC, HOKA drove the majority of the year-over-year volume gains with similar strength in the U.S. and international regions. Our growth was particularly strong in the U.S. as the brand continues to see earlier demand from wholesale partners and benefited from favorable year-over-year comparisons. Growth across HOKA and UGG was driven by full price business as both brands delivered exceptional gross margins in the wholesale channel. The health of our balanced business across the global marketplace reflects both the demand for our brands and our team's outstanding channel management. Our brands are off to a great start to fiscal '25 and I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal '25.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Stefano, and good afternoon, everyone. Deckers delivered strong results in the first quarter and demonstrated great progress towards our full fiscal year guidance leading to increased profitability within our outlook that I'll cover shortly.\nAs Dave outlined, HOKA was the main driver of growth in the quarter, delivering healthy gains in both the DTC and wholesale channels as the brand continues to build global awareness and market share. UGG delivered a solid quarter as the brand continued to see global demand in the DTC channel and increased its full price wholesale business in the U.S. As we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment, we will remain nimble in our approach to managing the business for the long-term sustainable growth and executing against our strategic priorities. Our portfolio of leading brands continues to resonate with consumers, which positions us well in the global marketplace.\nWith that, let's get into the detail of our first quarter fiscal year 2025 results. Revenue was $825 million, up 22% versus the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by HOKA as the brand increased 30% versus last year due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brand's global marketplace. Additionally, in the quarter, UGG increased 14%, primarily through wholesale gains as the brand continues to refill certain inventory in the marketplace.\nGross margin for the quarter was 56.9%, which was up 560 basis points from last year's 51.3%. As compared to last year, first quarter gross margin primarily benefited from favorable brand and product mix as both our highest-margin brand, HOKA as well as higher-margin products within UGG and HOKA drove a larger proportion of growth. Higher levels of full price selling, particularly with the UGG brand, which was more promotional in the prior year first quarter, and lower freight rates recognized in this quarter, which are anticipated to be a headwind for the remainder of this year. SG&A dollar spend in the first quarter was $337 million, which is up 22% from last year's $276 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 40.9% versus 40.8% in the prior year. SG&A dollar growth compared to last year was driven by investment in key areas of the business in support of our growth initiatives, which include higher marketing spend, primarily related to expanding global HOKA awareness and investments in talent to support key functions within our growing organization.\nOur tax rate was 22.5%, which compares to 21.9% in the prior year. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as the result of our share repurchase program drove diluted earnings per share of $4.52 for the quarter, which was $2.11 above last year's $2.41 per share, representing growth of 87%.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2024, we ended June with $1.44 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $753 million, up 2% versus the same point in time last year, and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $152 million worth of shares at an average price of $858.79. As of June 30, 2024, the company had approximately $790 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\nNow moving into our updated outlook for fiscal year 2025. We still expect total company revenue to grow approximately 10% versus last year to $4.7 billion inclusive of HOKA, which is still expected to grow approximately 20% and UGG, which is still expected to grow in the mid-single-digit range. We are increasing our gross margin, which is now expected to be approximately 54%, up 50 basis points from our prior guidance based on the strength of our first quarter results which included near-term benefits that are not expected to repeat for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our assumptions for the full fiscal year include a more normalized promotional environment with lower full-price selling relative to the exceptional levels delivered in fiscal year 2024 and higher freight costs incurred and still experiencing related to the inventory brought in that will be expensed in the remainder of the year. SG&A is now expected to be in the range of 34% to 34.5%, as we remain committed to investing in our key growth initiatives.\nOperating margin is now expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. As a result of these changes, we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectations to now be in the range of $29.75 to $30.65, representing a $0.65 increase on the high end. Please note, as mentioned in our release this afternoon, we have entered into an agreement to divest the Sanuk brand, which we expect to close in August 2024. As such, the ongoing Sanuk business has been removed from our forward-looking guidance. Further, this guidance excludes any unforeseen charges that may be considered nonrecurring to our ongoing business or any impact from future share repurchases.\nAdditionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. In addition, as most of you may have seen, our Board recently approved a 6 for 1 forward stock split of our outstanding capital stock which is pending stockholder approval at our 2024 Annual Meeting to be held on September 9. The potential impact of the stock split is not reflected in our EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the increased full fiscal year guidance as our disciplined operating model, in-demand global brands and robust financial profile position us well to adapt to evolving marketplace dynamics.\nBefore I hand the call back to Dave for his last time, I want to express my genuine appreciation for him. It has been a privilege and a pleasure working together for the last 12 years, especially the last 8 years with him as our CEO. I am proud of all we have achieved together, building Deckers into an industry-leading company with an exciting future ahead. Dave, I wish you all the best in your retirement, and I look forward to working with you as a member of our Board. Thanks, everyone.\nI'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThank you, Steve, for the kind words and Stefano for your kind remarks earlier. I appreciate all you continue to do for the Deckers organization. HOKA and UGG continue to excite and delight consumers with unique and innovative products that are driving increased demand. The momentum of these brands gives us confidence to achieve our updated guidance for the year. I believe Deckers is poised for long-term continued success. With the strength of these 2 powerful brands, a well-managed global marketplace, a focused and aligned management team, a disciplined approach to financial management and engage employees who embrace a purpose-led culture. I am proud of the culture we have built within our organization and for Deckers being recognized externally as well as one of the U.S. news and world reports, 2024 to 2025 Best Companies to work for, and as what have Time magazine's world's most sustainable companies of 2024.\nBefore handing off to the operator, there are a few things I'd like to add. First, I want to sincerely thank Steve Fasching. Steve has been an amazing partner to me over the past 8 years. and has had a tremendous impact on Deckers and our success. Steve deserves to be recognized for his leadership and disciplined strategic approach to developing and maintaining our strong operating model and fortified balance sheet. We've been through a lot together and I just want to say thank you, Steve. I also want to thank Erinn and Andy on our Investor Relations team. They have done an outstanding job preparing us for these quarterly calls and communicating Deckers strategy with all of you. It has been a pleasure working with them both. Thank you for all you've done, and we'll continue to do at Deckers. I'm actually going to miss these earnings calls.\nLastly, I want to express my gratitude for the final time. It has been the honor of a lifetime leading Deckers for the last 8 years. and I am proud of all we accomplished together during this time. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees for making Deckers not only a successful company, but also an amazing place to work. We have proven that we are truly better together and that we can do a lot of good while doing great. Deckers is in excellent hands with Stefano and his leadership team. I have no doubt that he will do an exceptional job leading this organization and maintaining our great culture and strong results as he, along with our leadership team and all of our amazing employees build the future of Deckers. One last time on behalf of our management team, I want to thank everyone for listening and for your continued support.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

We also substantially expanded profitability as earnings per share has grown at a CAGR of 32%. With the scale of our organization's growth, we are continuing to bolster our foundation through investments that support the long-term success of our leading brands. HOKA and UGG have become 2 of the strongest and most in-demand brands in the footwear space. They are continuing to win with consumers by our infusing performance and fashion into products that embrace their respective brand codes.\nBuilding on the outstanding progress we have made over the last few years, our teams are laser-focused on the significant opportunities that lie ahead as we seek to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar global player in the performance athletic space, grow UGG with premium products and elevated experiences that enhance consumer connections, expand DTC through engagement, acquisition and retention gains and advance our international markets through targeted investments. Our robust and innovative product pipeline comprised of relevant and distinct products is amplified by our marketplace management strategies and gives us the confidence to continue progressing on these initiatives as we create the future of Deckers.\nSteve will provide further specifics about our fiscal year 2025 expectations as well as our fiscal year 2024 financial performance. But first, I would like to share some of the brand and channel highlights. Starting with the brand highlights. Global HOKA revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 28% versus the prior year. For the year, HOKA growth was driven by increased brand awareness with the U.S. rising to approximately 40% and international regions, on average, reaching just over 20%. Global DTC, which increased 40% versus last year, market share gains with key global wholesale partners and, most importantly, success with new performance innovations across the road, trail and lifestyle product categories. From a brand awareness standpoint, these are significant strides for HOKA.\nAcross the board, HOKA is experiencing significant gains on both the season over season and a year-over-year standpoint. Aligned with our strategy to solidify HOKA as a global player, international regions are driving particularly strong gains in awareness, increasing more than 80% versus the prior year. Global consumers who identify as runners remain our highest awareness group and continue to see strong increases, but we are also seeing really powerful growth among consumers who are more general fitness oriented. While HOKA is increasing its awareness across all age groups, growth is strongest among 18- to 34-year-olds globally with brand awareness among this influential age group nearly doubling year-over-year. We believe the continued progress introducing HOKA to new consumers around the world has resulted from our increased investments in brand marketing through the expansion of the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign, including greater out-of-home digital and physical assets, dedicated and enhanced sponsorship of both globally recognized and local running events such as UTMB with HOKA becoming the new title sponsor, enriched engagement with social media across various platforms, and a greater retail footprint that allows for community building activities like our HOKA Run Club.\nWe are pleased to see these investments paying off not only through increased awareness across markets, but also by growing brand consideration and purchase intent, some of which is happening in real time. We are proud of the great progress our teams are making, but also recognize that HOKA still has plenty of room to grow awareness, consideration and ultimately, market share across all global regions.\nHOKA has an amazing opportunity ahead as the brand continues to win with consumers around the world, and we look forward to facing this challenge head on through a relentless focus on product innovation and authentic consumer engagement.\nFrom a channel perspective, HOKA continues to excel across its ecosystem of global access points. Recall at the outset of fiscal year 2024, we noted the brand's focus on building full price market share with existing points of wholesale distribution through a pull model and increasing the mix of DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains. The result of our disciplined marketplace management strategy achieved both goals with HOKA delivering record gross margins as the brand benefited from maintaining exceptionally high levels of full price selling despite operating in a more promotional marketplace and shifting mix to DTC, which increased to 38%, up from 34% in the prior year.\nI would also note that the HOKA brand's strong growth through full-price selling in the wholesale channel was accomplished primarily through market share gains with existing distribution and greater efficiency with recently opened doors relative to locations that were eliminated.\nRegarding HOKA DTC, revenue growth was driven by global increases in acquired and retained consumers, which expanded 32% and 44%, respectively. We remain encouraged by the growth across markets, with the U.S. continuing to deliver strong increases in alignment with the global averages and international regions increasing more than 50% in both acquisition and retention. These consumer growth figures are leading indicators of HOKA brand adoption, highlighting the brand's ability to both expand the scope of HOKA consumers and retain existing consumers through consistent product innovations that delivered an unmatched wearing experience.\nAs we continue to introduce HOKA to new consumers around the world, we view branded retail stores in key cities as an important consumer engagement vehicle. Just a few weeks ago, HOKA opened its second European retail store in Paris, France. Though only open for a short time, we have been very encouraged by the consumer feedback, conversion and broad product adoption. We were excited for HOKA to have a footing in this important market, particularly as the location expect to see high traffic during the upcoming summer Olympics.\nOn the product front, HOKA is driving growth and consumer acquisition through innovative updates and new introductions across a diverse assortment of footwear. The HOKA brand's fiscal year 2024 performance was primarily driven by road running favorites like the Clifton and Bondi franchises, stability staples like the Arahi and Gaviota, both of which received updates during the year, trail conquers like the Speed Go, Challenger and Stinson franchises and everyday performance lifestyle shoes like the Transport, Solimar and the Kawana. We expect these styles will continue to contribute to the growth of HOKA moving forward, but are also really excited about the brand's ongoing efforts to constantly infuse new innovations into the product assortment.\nBack in February, we highlighted the launch of the all-new Cielo X1, which represents the pinnacle of the HOKA brands race offering. We have been in awe of the consumer response to this incredible shoe, which sold out almost immediately in the initial launch colorway. While we don't expect to drive significant volumes on this very specific ultra performance shoe, we're excited and encouraged by the consumer demand validating HOKA in this category. Our progress in this more niche category is designed to emphasize the brand's performance routes even as we expand the consumer aperture to more commercial styles.\nWith respect to these broader, more commercially focused products, we have been impressed by the consumer response to our latest update of the MAC franchise, the MAC 6. This completely redesigned silhouette was upgraded with a supercritical foam midsole and strategic rubber coverage on the outsell for greater durability while remaining our lightest mark to date. Sell-through of this versatile and responsive style at our wholesale partners and in our DTC channel has been exceptional with the MAC 6 becoming a top 5 style across all of Deckers since its launch.\nInnovation is the HOKA brand's top priority, continuing to develop groundbreaking products that energize consumers around the world. We are fortunate to have a phenomenal roster of HOKA athletes, who we will continue partnering with to drive greater athlete enhanced innovations into our most Pinnacle products while also further developing the assortment to segment and differentiate HOKA distribution as we continue to scale. The recently launched Skyward X is the perfect example of new product innovation that benefits our segmentation efforts. This all-new style was developed as our first carbon plated shoe that is designed for everyday runs with maximum cushion. The Skyward X has a revolutionary suspension system to pair with its convex carbon plate that gives the runner cushion for impact with a natural spring forward. This style helps elevate the HOKA assortment sitting above other MAX Cushing styles from both a price point and performance perspective.\nThis allows HOKA widen distribution on other styles while the Skyward X is targeted for specific accounts like run specialty, top strategic performance stores and our DTC channel.\nAs we methodically open new access points for HOKA over the next year, we continue to fine-tune differentiated assortments across geographic markets and channels of distribution. I could not be prouder of the HOKA team's incredible results over the last year. We are pleased to now have a proven industry leader like Robin Green, who joined us in February leading the team and are looking forward to the positive impact we believe she can have to drive HOKA into its next phase of growth.\nMoving on to UGG. Global revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 16% versus the prior year. For the year, UGG growth derived from the key initiatives set forth at the outset of FY '24, as aligned product, marketing and commercial execution drove global increases in DTC acquisition and retention and expansion in international markets. These results are a testament of our powerful product engine and disciplined product management strategy.\nThe UGG brand continues to maintain important relationships with valued wholesale partners while delivering strong results through the segmentation and differentiation of global marketplaces. With the allocation of core products driving high levels of full price sell-through and lean inventories in the marketplace, UGG has become a leading brand in wholesale, while funneling upside demand to the DTC channel.\nFor the year, this contributed to global gains in both DTC acquisition and retention, which increased 18% and 17%, respectively, contributing to the UGG brand's 22% increase in global DTC revenue. This is a truly impressive result for our DTC channel and speaks to the work our brand, marketing and PR teams have been doing to maintain high levels of brand heat year-round from seeding products with global and regional influencers, creating compelling product collaborations with prominent brands and showing up on the runway at fashion weeks around the world to deepening consumer connections through elevated brand experiences like the Field House or a recent Formula 1 activation.\nThe UGG team has consistently developed interesting and on-brand content to stay top of mind with consumers. We believe the continued focus of our teams are working with local individuals across global markets has helped UGG connect and resonate more effectively with international consumers. Whether it be partnering with Honey from K-PoP Group [indiscernible] or the collaboration with Gallery Department expanding access to influential retailers in Europe. These efforts have helped establish UGG in its healthiest position to date across influential international markets.\nThis contributed to UGG delivering an international growth rate of more than 2x that of the double-digit revenue growth from the U.S. market. The success of these initiatives drove significant shifts in the composition of UGG revenue aligned with our long-term strategy, with DTC increasing to a record 50% of mix and international increasing to 37% of mix, up from approximately 30% 3 years ago. Both of these ships were margin accretive and when combined with exceptionally high levels of full price selling and benefits from select price increases resulted in record high gross margin for the UGG brand in fiscal year 2024.\nOf course, this is all underpinned by the UGG brand's ongoing creation of compelling products that are resonating around the world. What impresses me most about the UGG brand's performance in fiscal year 2024 is that the brand drove a 16% increase in revenue through single-digit unit growth with significantly fewer SKUs than the prior year. UGG was able to achieve this because of the increased global alignment on the brand product assortment, creating efficiencies on marketing stories and inventory purchasing.\nLast year, we spoke about the UGG team's focus to reimagine iconic styles, and that is exactly what we saw play out during FY '24, and what we continue to see consumer is excited about in the upcoming fiscal year. The UGG product team continues to delight consumers by creating threads that connect new styles to existing icons.\nOver the last couple of years, we've seen this take shape with the Ultra Mini inspired by the Classic Mini; Platform Classics, inspired by the original classics and the Tazz, inspired by the Tasman. These are just a few examples of product evolutions that have helped UGG build the shoulder seasons outside of fall and winter, attracting new consumers while remaining rooted in the brand's heritage.\nKeeping an eye on the future, UGG continues to build upon franchises that are reimagining of existing icons in new categories. The Golden Collection is 1 we continue to be very excited about. UGG first introduced the Golden Star sandal a couple of years ago, which is a strappy sandal inspired by the original classic boot. This style has continued to blossom on its own and we're also seeing great enthusiasm for new adjacent styles in the collection, including the Golden Glo sandal, a water-friendly colorful version of the original Goldenstar, which has become an instant hit and the Goldenstar Clog, which was spotted on basketball Superstar, Catlin Clark, shortly after shoes drafted first overall to the WNBA.\nOutside of the Golden Collection, UGG is developing compelling new products in the slip-on shoe and sneaker category, which includes the [indiscernible], a sneaker silhouette inspired by the original new mill boot that continues to sell out quickly as new inventory comes into the marketplace and venture days, a rugged outdoor take on the original Tasman, which sold out quickly in China and was recently worn by Formula One Star Pierre Gasly at the Miami Grand free.\nThese emerging franchises, along with complementary styles give us confidence that UGG will continue to capitalize on high levels of brand heat and demand to deliver strong performance for years to come. Congratulations to the UGG team on another excellent year.\nMoving to our discussion of consolidated channel performance, Deckers' fiscal year 2024 results reflected the success of our omnichannel marketplace management strategies that continue to preserve our brand's premium positioning around the world. By tightly managing marketplace inventory, we were able to drive strong full price sell-through, increase market share and capture upside demand in our direct-to-consumer channel. This led to outstanding DTC growth, which for fiscal year 2024, increased revenue 27% versus last year by adding nearly $400 million of incremental business.\nDTC represented 43% of total company revenue, which is up from 40% in the prior fiscal year. DTC gains resulted from strength across brands with HOKA and UGG DTC increasing 40% and 22%, respectively. Regions with international and domestic DTC increasing 37% and 22%, respectively, and consumers with acquired and retained increasing 21% and 24%, respectively, across all brands. On a DTC comparable basis, revenue increased 25% versus last year, reflecting positive engagement and conversion of demand for the great products that our brands are bringing to market across both online and in-store direct-to-consumer touch points.\nFrom a wholesale perspective, fiscal year 2024 revenue increased 13% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by high levels of full-priced global demand for the UGG and HOKA brands, which resulted in healthy sell-throughs at our valued partners as we maintain lean inventories in the wholesale marketplace.\nWe are entering fiscal year 2025 in a position of strength because of the successful execution of our omni-channel brand and marketplace management strategy. As our brand teams continue to delight consumers with unique and innovative products, our commercial teams will continue to execute on this strategy, working with our fantastic partners to maintain our brand's premium positioning in their respective marketplaces. With that, I'll hand it over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2025. Steve?\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, Deckers' performance in fiscal year 2024 was exceptional as we drove our fourth consecutive year of double-digit top line growth and delivered top-tier levels of profitability. Deckers has added over $1.1 billion of incremental revenue in 2 years, driven by the strength of the HOKA and UGG brands as innovative and consumer-obsessed product creation continues to resonate globally.\nOur flexible operating model and disciplined approach to marketplace management has allowed us to capitalize on these high levels of brand heat while maintaining exceptional levels of full price selling leading to our record earnings in fiscal year 2024.\nOur dedication to our long-term strategic initiatives continues to be the foundation for our success, as we remain committed to driving profitable growth over the long term. With that, let's get into a recap of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $960 million, representing an increase of 21% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by HOKA and UGG, which saw increases of 34% and 15%, respectively. On HOKA, the brand delivered its first ever $0.5 billion quarter as DTC maintained momentum with volume continuing to grow quarter-over-quarter and wholesale reaccelerated from both a percentage and volume perspective as the brand benefited from key product launches and the wholesale fill-in activity.\nFor UGG, the brand delivered an exceptional quarter as DTC was able to maintain momentum from Q3, delivering another strong increase despite some inventory shortages on certain key products and wholesale drove growth versus last year despite selling significantly fewer units as the brand was able to replace the majority of last year's closeout volume with full price shipments into a depleted marketplace and international strength was maintained.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter was 56.2%, a 620 basis point increase from the prior year. The improved gross margin primarily relates to extraordinary benefits from higher mix above full price selling, including lower closeouts, select price increases as well as favorable brand and product mix and freight savings.\nSG&A for the fourth quarter was $395 million, representing 41.2% of revenue, which compares to last year's $290 million and a 36.7% of revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 450 basis points year-over-year, primarily as we accelerated top of funnel marketing spend to build longer-term awareness and our strong fiscal 2024 results drove higher performance-related compensation. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count from our share repurchase program drove diluted earnings per share of $4.95, which compares to $3.46 in the prior year period, representing a 43% increase.\nWith the strength of our fourth quarter, Deckers delivered exceptional full year fiscal 2024 results, which includes revenues increasing 18% versus last year to a record $4.288 billion. As compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by robust HOKA growth across regions and channels led by strong DTC growth of 40% as the brand continues to gain awareness across its well-managed ecosystem of access points and broad-based UGG growth as the brand grew 16% and eclipsed $2.2 billion of revenue primarily through DTC and international strength.\nGross margins for the year were 55.6%, up 530 basis points versus last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily related to favorable UGG full price selling freight savings, select pricing benefits as well as favorable brand and product mix and favorable channel mix with DTC growth outpacing wholesale.\nSG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.46 billion, up 24% versus the prior year's $1.17 billion. SG&A represented 34% of revenue, which is 170 basis points above last year's rate. The SG&A increase as compared to last year was driven primarily by investment in talent to support key functions within our growing organization and higher performance compensation, higher marketing spend, including strategic spend to amplify HOKA awareness in leading international markets, and infrastructure investments and related depreciation to support the continued growth of our organization. This all resulted in a full fiscal year 2024 operating margin of 21.6%, which is 360 basis points above last year, reflecting the improvement in gross margin experienced partially offset by the normalization of our rate of SG&A spend.\nAs illustrated by our results, we continue delivering top-tier levels of profitability. And while we are pleased with these results, we remain mindful that the outsized margin expansion experienced particularly from historically low levels of promotion and discounting may not repeat to the same degree in future periods. For the year, our effective tax rate was 22.4%, which is flat to last year. Our strong performance, along with higher interest income and a lower share count from share repurchase activity culminated in a record diluted earnings per share of $29.16, which represents a 51% increase over last year's $19.37.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2024, we ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $474 million, down 11% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $104 million worth of shares at an average price of $875.01 per share. For the entire fiscal year 2024, we repurchased over 700,000 shares for approximately $415 million at an average per share price of $580.44. At March 31, 2024, the company still had approximately $942 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\nNow moving to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect top line revenue growth of approximately 10% versus the prior year to $4.7 billion, with HOKA as the main driver of growth increasing approximately 20% versus the prior year through consumer acquisition and retention gains in our DTC channel, expanding strategically through key partners while maintaining disciplined marketplace management and maintaining a dedicated focus on growing awareness and market share internationally.\nUGG increasing mid-single digits, driven primarily by international expansion and managing a healthy U.S. marketplace, which includes prioritizing our DTC channel as we focus on maintaining the brand's pull model. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 53.5%, which is down 210 basis points versus last year as we are anticipating a more normalized promotional environment with lower full price selling than the exceptional levels achieved in fiscal year 2024 and higher freight costs.\nSG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we continue reinforcing our foundation and supporting key growth initiatives, which includes increased levels of marketing spend, primarily related to our continued focus to expand global HOKA awareness, investment in talent to bolster integral teams supporting the growth of our organization and IT and warehouse investments. We expect an operating margin of approximately 19.5%, reflecting our commitment to deliver top-tier levels of profitability while continuing to invest for the long-term growth of our brands. We are projecting an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%, with this all resulting in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $29.50 to $30.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million, which is above last year as we invest in supply chain and warehouse capabilities, capital IT projects, retail refreshments, including opening select new strategic locations and updates to office facilities. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives and delivering towards the full fiscal year. Per normal course, we will not be providing formal quarterly guidance. However, given we are more than halfway through the first quarter, we wanted to provide some context around our expectations for the quarter ending June 30. These include revenue growth in the high teens as we continue to refill depleted channel inventory that is pulling forward demand this year, and HOKA has maintained strong momentum in the DTC channel.\nGross margin slightly above the full fiscal year guided rate as we benefit from reduced UGG promotion activity relative to last year in this quarter, select price increases on popular UGG style that we begin to lap in the second quarter and the largest proportion of HOKA revenue contribution.\nI would additionally note that beyond the first quarter, our gross margin will be up against exceptional levels of full price selling for the UGG brand. And thus, we do not expect the favorability relative to last year to continue beyond Q1. Regarding SG&A, our dollar growth rate in the first quarter is planned significantly higher as we front-load investments to support our growing organization. The higher earlier planned spending is driven by investments in marketing to launch brand campaigns that are further supporting some of the demand shifts we are seeing as well as some earlier FX remeasurement headwinds resulting from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Thanks, everyone. And with that, I'll now hand off the call to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThanks, Steve. I am so proud of the tenacity that our teams have consistently demonstrated to outperform expectations while continuously evolving in a dynamic consumer environment. As I near the end of my tenure leading the Deckers organization, I could not be prouder of how far we have come over the last 8 years. Our company has transformed into a leading portfolio of consumer favorite brands. We have experienced explosive growth by incredible and still increasing brand heat across HOKA and UGG.\nOur organization has proven to be incredibly resilient, and we have worked with agility to continuously deliver outstanding results.\nThe company's success is largely attributable to our aligned long-term strategies, our highly effective leaders across the organization and hard-working and caring employees that continue to execute as we transform the business. Deckers is in an excellent position to continue on this path as Stefano steps into the role of CEO in just a few months. He has been a key contributor to our successful transformation and knows what it takes to lead Deckers on this continued journey. He and I are continuing to work together to ensure a smooth transition.\nTogether, we are deeply committed to fostering Deckers collaborative and inspiring culture inclusive of encouraging authenticity, teamwork and a common goal to do good and to do great. This has cultivated a strong and growing team of exceptionally talented long-time employees and critical new hires across our global organization, which are the driving force behind our iconic brands, and I believe we'll continue to galvanize the pathway for future success.\nOn behalf of our executive leadership team and Board of Directors, I'd like to once again thank our employees for all their dedication to Deckers values and delivery of yet another full year of record results. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for their continued support along the way. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to speak to the leadership announcement we made today. After 11 years at Deckers, I've decided to retire as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1. I will continue to serve as a member of the company's Board of Directors. On a personal note, after 30 years in this industry, I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, pursuing my other life passions and exploring more ways in which I can make a positive impact on the world. Serving as CEO of Deckers has been a great honor and it's a privilege to work with some of the best talent this industry has to offer. I'm incredibly proud of our accomplishments and our unique culture built on doing good and doing great.\nDeckers continues to demonstrate exceptional performance, and we have a strong foundation from which to continue driving results, a deep bench of talent and innovative products that are resonating with consumers globally. I believe it's a good time for us to make this transition. We're all thrilled that the Board has selected Stefano Caroti, our Chief Commercial Officer, as Decker's next President and CEO, following a thorough succession planning process. Many of you know him already, but for those of you who don't, Stefano has an extensive industry and experience, and he seamlessly led our omnichannel, regional and HOKA brand operations during some of Decker's most pivotal years. He is passionate about Deckers and its values, and he has been a key member of the executive team, helping to craft and progress consumer-focused marketplace strategy and our inclusive and engaged culture.\nI know Deckers will be in excellent hands with Stefano at the helm. Over the next 6 months, Stefano and I will continue to execute on Decker's proven strategy. We are invigorated about this next phase of our work together and for Decker's bright future. Now let's turn our attention to our Q3 performance. I'm glad to be here today discussing another record-breaking quarter for Deckers Brands as our 2 leading brands continued bucking industry trends to deliver high-quality growth via full-price consumer demand. Key highlights of our record-breaking third quarter results include total company revenue increasing 16% to $1.56 billion, DTC revenue increasing 23% representing a quarterly record 55% of total company revenue, total UGG revenue increasing 15% to achieve its first ever $1 billion quarter, total HOKA revenue increasing 22% to $429 million, total company gross margins increasing over 500 basis points to an all-time quarterly high of 58.7% and diluted earnings per share increasing 44% to $15.11.\nWe believe the success of our brands and company as a whole continues to be the direct result of innovative product that is on trend and resonates with consumers across the globe, decision-making that is guided by our long-term strategic objectives, alignment between product creation, marketing and omnichannel distribution that centers around the consumer and the strong execution of our teams to deliver in real time while remaining focused on the longer-term vision of our marquee brands. We are thrilled by the success of this quarter, but I feel it's important to reflect on how these results represent a continuation of strong year-to-date performance as well as many years of careful strategic execution. Our brands are thinking long term. And while we are happy to produce great quarterly results, we are even more pleased to see the consistency of performance. With the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year behind us, we believe we are on track to deliver mid-teens revenue growth, which would be the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth in the mid-teens or higher.\nHighlights from the first 9 months include global HOKA revenue growing 25% versus last year, led by a near 50% increase in DTC, global UGG revenue increasing 16% versus last year, led by international regions growing close to 30% and global DTC increasing more than 20% and total portfolio DTC revenue increasing 28% with robust growth in both consumer acquisition and retention. I'm extremely proud of the collaboration across the Deckers organization to deliver these exceptional results through the first 9 months of fiscal year 2024. We are creating remarkably distinct, relevant and breakthrough product concepts that are deeply rooted in consumer insights and brand DNA. This is distinguishing our brands from the competition. our strategic execution of brand and marketplace management, combined with our financial discipline, preserves Decker's position of strength as we focus on closing out fiscal year 2024 and plan for the significant opportunity in the years ahead.\nSteve will provide additional color on this quarter's financial performance and our related increased outlook for the full fiscal year. But in the meantime, let's dive into third quarter brand and channel highlights. Starting with UGG. Global UGG revenue for the third quarter was $1.07 billion, representing a 15% increase versus the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by global DTC, which increased 20% in the quarter to represent 62% of total brand revenue, up from 60% last year, aided by international and domestic consumer acquisition increasing 14% and 8%, respectively, and retained consumers increasing 26% and 8% across international and domestic regions, respectively. In addition to driving a significant increase to gross margin, the outsized growth from DTC helped deliver a double-digit increase in the brand's consolidated global average selling price.\nAs in general, DTC selling results in a much higher ASP and a favorable gross margin relative to the wholesale channel, UGG commended extraordinarily high levels of full-price selling and the brand benefited from select price increases on a few of its most popular styles. The cohesion of product, marketing and consumer targeting, in addition to a reduced SKU count drove focused energy behind key styles which has greatly contributed to the success UGG is experiencing this year, recognizing that there was unmet consumer demand last year and capitalizing on the continued brand momentum driven by that scarcity, the UGG team invested in additional inventory to support its most popular product. Helping fuel brand heat and further the conversation with target consumers during the third quarter, UGG's spearheaded meaningful collaborations, most notably with Palace Skateboards, selling out in minutes across key cities like New York, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo. Hosted Pinnacle brand experience field houses in New York, Paris and Seoul, and launched a first of its kind UGG Extreme Capsule that features fashionable performance products capable of handling winter's most brutal conditions.\nThese top-of-the-funnel brand activations, combined with community building and social listening across digital platforms help UGG create positive brand buzz and increase opportunities for consumer connections that offer feedback in real time. This year's coordination between DTC operations and product marketing on social channels elevated the launches of New Styles or Colors and brought greater traffic and attention to the brand when hot products were being restocked. From a regional standpoint, UGG has maintained high levels of brand heat and demand almost universally across the globe to deliver strong year-to-date growth across the U.S., Europe and Asia. Helping bolster UGG performance in the third quarter, the brand opened a couple of exciting new stores in key markets, including a Shanghai flagship, which offers one of the most contemporary visual expressions of UGG anywhere in the world and the brand's first full-price location in Germany with a new Munich store. Both stores are performing extremely well.\nIn Shanghai, we are seeing average transaction values that are approximately 20% above the average UGG store in China, as well as the conversion rate more than double that of the average. Though early days, the Munich store is experiencing ATVs that are 25% higher than the average European UGG store, with conversion rate well above that of the average UGG store in Germany. Similar to what we often see in markets where new stores opened, Germany's online business for UGG benefited from this additional consumer touch point, posting both the highest online growth rate and highest conversion rate of any European country in the third quarter for the brand. We are pleased to see these new consumer touch points are helping produce positive results in key international markets where we continue to see long-term opportunities for the UGG brand. The success UGG is now experiencing among international regions is a direct result of our thoughtful multiyear marketplace management implementation that fostered the alignment of product creation, localized marketing content and brand-enhancing distribution partners.\nWith the momentum and brand heat UGG has created among international markets, we are even more excited about the global opportunities ahead. From a style perspective, UGG experienced growth and success with key franchises like the Tasman, Ultra Mini and Classic Mini, including the fashion-oriented platform versions of each as well as new introductions that include the Weather Hybrid Collection, Golden Star Clog and the Lowmel sneaker. The Weather Hybrid Collection was positioned as a modern weatherized update to a few of the UGG brand's most popular styles including the Tasman, Neumel and Classic Boot. Our PRR teams partnered with influential NBA star, [ Jalan Brown ], to highlight the launch, which helped with all gender collection drive strong sell-through among all consumers. The Golden Star Clog was somewhat of a surprise hit during the holiday season as it was created to bolster the shoulder seasons outside of winter, complementing the rising Golden Star Sandal. The Lowmel, which we see as the first unmistakably UGG sneaker represented a continuation of our hybrid strategy to redefine categories through UGG DNA.\nWe believe Tasman's adoption of a sneaker versus previously being purchased primarily as an indoor slipper has given UGG permission to play in the sneaker category, in which the Lowmel performed extremely well, selling out quickly across the globe. Both the Golden Star Clog and Lowmel have been positioned for expansion into the spring and next fall as the UGG brand continues to build connections with consumers through a cohesive year-round product assortment. Through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, UGG has delivered undeniably impressive results. The brand has driven exceptional growth in focus areas, including international regions and global DTC and has done so by acquiring and retaining target consumers with full price product. I'd like to congratulate and thank the entire team for their hard work and collaboration that enabled the brand's success in the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date. Shifting to HOKA.\nGlobal HOKA revenue in the third quarter was $429 million, representing a 22% increase versus the prior year. HOKA has continued to deliver consistent year-over-year growth in volume each quarter this year, reflecting the brand's balanced seasonality and year-round demand. Similar to what HOKA experienced in the first half, third quarter growth was primarily driven by gains in the DTC channel as intended with HOKA diligently managing the wholesale marketplace to drive market share gains with high levels of full price sell-through. More specifically on DTC performance, HOKA revenue in the channel increased 38% in Q3, representing over 40% of total brand revenue which is 5 percentage points higher than last year. DTC growth has been driven by significant increases in consumer acquisition with international and domestic experience growth of 50% and 27%, respectively, and important gains in retained consumers, which increased 55% internationally and 33% in the U.S.\nThe HOKA brand's DTC business has been strong in every single region this year. but has been particularly powerful in Europe and China, 2 regions where we have been emphasizing growth in the channel as brand awareness grows. Both regions have benefited from a greater retail presence. In Europe, HOKA opens its first retail location in Covent Garden London during the third quarter, which is performing exceptionally well, and the brand has a location plan to open in Paris in time for the Olympics. In China, HOKA has added 4 new company-owned locations throughout this year, in which the consumer experience has continued to improve, particularly with a greater focus on key stories and a new capsule collection of apparel that [indiscernible] our compelling in-store product assortment. Complementing the added stores in China, we continue to see our premiumization efforts online paying off as HOKA has achieved high levels of full price sell-through online, which is a channel that China generally uses for promotion activity.\nOne example of this during the third quarter was China's [indiscernible] 11 event, better known as Singles Day, which is a countrywide event that features widespread discounts across brands, and product categories, known for driving significant consumer traffic online. This year, HOKA benefited from the online traffic despite low levels of promotion and maintain strong full price selling, particularly in comparison to competitive brands. We are very encouraged by the increasing adoption of HOKA across international markets, particularly in the DTC channel, where we have been focusing our growth efforts while managing the wholesale environment to maintain high levels of full price sell-through. We believe HOKA is still in the early stages of expansion internationally as we continue to build brand awareness in key markets to establish HOKA as a major worldwide player in the performance space. Over in the U.S., where we also see a significant opportunity for growth, I want to take a moment to highlight an amazing event that HOKA had a huge impact on during the third quarter. HOKA was a presenting sponsor of the 44th Annual Foot Locker Cross Country National Championships, outfitting thousands of elite high school athletes with complementary footwear and apparel. This event was the center of the U.S. Running World and Media for 3 days, driving significant impressions and some of the highest brand engagement we have ever seen for HOKA.\nOn the product front, HOKA continues to develop and refine a compelling assortment of performance products that enable athletes of all kinds to achieve their goals. This morning, HOKA announced the introduction of the all-new [ Cielo X1 ] that sits atop the brand's assortment as the ultimate race day shoe for the most discerning athletes. The [ Cielo X1 ] was designed with insights and feedback from the HOKA brands roster of elite athletes, incorporating the most advanced geometry, foam compounds and plate technologies to enable record-setting results. Before it was even commercially available, the [ Cielo X1 ] has already made its podium debut as HOKA now has an elite member, Kelyn Taylor, won the Rock & Roll San Jose Half Marathon wearing the [ Cielo X1 ] qualifying her for the 2024 Olympics Marathon trial for Team USA.\nBeyond the brand's Pinnacle performance product, HOKA is also experiencing success with exciting lifestyle-oriented products. These products feature the same quality and comfort expected from a performance HOKA shoe bought our package in an everyday wear aesthetic for more versatile wearing occasions. HOKA Transport has become the brand's go-to casual shoe now sitting within the brand's top 10 best sellers. The HOKA brands captivating collaborations are also furthering its resonance with the lifestyle consumer. They are designed to reach a new audience by partnering with logical yet unexpected brands. Most recently, HOKA partnered with Satisfied Running, a French running apparel brand to co-create an exciting new take on the Clifton LS, which sold out almost instantly, highlighting the partnership theme of highs and lows Satisfied created a one-of-a-kind community experience that brought together the skateboard, trail and running communities to join in the sprint down the steep hills of San Francisco.\nAs we continue building HOKA for the long term, our focus is to remain a top brand in road running, expanding with innovative performance footwear, become a dominant off-road player with disruptive trail and hike products and bring the HOKA experience to the lifestyle consumer while keeping the brand rooted in performance. While we are at different stages of this journey across domestic and international markets, we see significant global opportunities ahead with this powerful brand. We are proud of the consistent momentum HOKA is achieving around the world, our efforts to build brand awareness and drive high full price sell-through continue to bear fruit and have set the stage for a strong finish to the year with another record quarter. Now moving to our discussion of consolidated channel performance.\nDuring the third quarter, performance remained strong across both DTC and wholesale. However, in line with our strategic objectives, DTC remained the fastest-growing channel increasing 23% versus last year to represent a record 55% of the quarter's revenue, up from 52% in the prior year. DTC's success continues to be broad-based across brands with HOKA and UGG DTC increasing 38% and 20%, respectively. Regions with international and domestic DTC increasing 40% and and 16%, respectively, and consumers with acquired and retained increasing 13% and 16%, respectively, across all brands. In addition, as discussed, we are also experiencing strong engagement with our brands, both online and in-store, reflecting the quality of our omnichannel operations and ability to provide a consistent consumer experience. Furthering the success of DTC, we continue to see a double-digit increase in the average selling price through the third quarter, driven by a greater mix of HOKA, which carries the highest ASP in the portfolio. Higher UGG full-price selling, including benefits from select price increases and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. With respect to consolidated wholesale performance, third quarter revenue increased 9% versus last year, with domestic HOKA and UGG contributing the majority of the incremental dollar volume.\nWe are very pleased with this strong wholesale result, especially considering the tight marketplace management we have been focused on executing during this fiscal year. As a result of these efforts, our brands drove high levels of full price sell-through, entering calendar 2024 with lean channel inventories that have created opportunities for market share gains going forward. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide more specifics on third quarter performance and an update to our fiscal year 2024 guidance.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance exceeded expectations and demonstrated the continued strength of our brands. As Dave mentioned, UGG delivered strong growth in the quarter at exceptional brand heat continued to capture consumers globally, and we were able to meet incremental demand through our [ DTC in ] the quarter with expedited shipments of the brand's most popular styles. HOKA drove another quarter of solid growth, led by the DTC channel as we continue to diligently manage the wholesale marketplace, all while driving high levels of full price sell-through. These results are a testament to the exceptional demand for our brands as our compelling and innovative product offerings continue to resonate with consumers globally during the holiday season and well beyond, helping drive phenomenal performance.\nOur disciplined operating approach and robust financial profile have continued to enable our brands and company to execute a strategy that delivers strong results while keeping us positioned to achieve our commitment to driving success over the long term. Now let's get to the specifics of the third quarter financial performance.\nThird quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1.56 billion, representing an increase of 16% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 15% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by broad-based UGG growth across regions and channels, delivering $1.07 billion of revenue with global DTC increasing 20% as brand heat remains robust with all DTC regions exhibiting a double-digit percentage growth in the period and continued strong demand across the HOKA ecosystem of access points with particular strength in the DTC channel, which increased 38% versus last year, contributing to the brand's total revenue of $429 million in the quarter. Notably, HOKA's DTC performance for the quarter was aided by global increases in consumer acquisition, which was up 31% versus last year and consumer retention, which was up 35% versus last year.\nAdditionally, I would note that this quarter's revenue growth was aided by a higher percentage of full-price selling as well as the UGG brand select price increases, both of which contributed to dollar growth outpacing unit growth. While we will always manage our brands with the intent to deliver high levels of full price selling, the level we experienced this year, particularly for UGG and its peak season is one we don't expect will always repeat. This dynamic, combined with a larger-than-expected impact from price increases due to the strength of performance from affected styles is part of the catalyst for our increased full year expectations for growth. Gross margins for the quarter was 58.7%, which was up 580 basis points from last year's 53%. As compared to last year, gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher mix of UGG full price selling, freight savings, select pricing action and favorable brand and product mix, favorable channel mix with DTC continuing to grow faster than wholesale, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nWhile we are exceptionally proud of these remarkable results, we remain mindful that the outsized margin expansion seen this quarter is above normalized levels and it's not something we anticipate will repeat to the same degree. While we do see opportunities to continue to deliver top-tier profitability through our key strategies, items that we anticipate may not repeat in a normalized environment include the extremely low levels of promotional activity achieved for our 2 major brands, considerable benefits from UGG pricing actions and very low freight costs that are now on the rise as well as other potential macroeconomic factors such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. SG&A dollar spend in the third quarter was $429 million, up 23% versus last year's $350 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 150 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to investment in talent to support key functions within our growing organization and higher marketing spend. Our tax rate was 21.9%, which is lower than last year's 23.7%. These results, combined with favorable interest income relative to last year and a lower share count drove record diluted earnings per share of $15.11 which compares to last year's $10.48 diluted earnings per share, representing EPS growth of 44%.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2023, we ended this fiscal third quarter with $1.65 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $539 million, down 25% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. On inventory specifically, I'd note that with the strong levels of selling that we have seen this year, we are now below normal operating levels for the current size of our organization. And heading into next year, we expect to see incremental inventory investment to keep up with growth. Today's inventory position reflects the upside that has already been captured in the quarter just completed, which could have a small impact on sales in the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares at an average price of $507.95. As of December 31, 2023, the company had approximately $1.05 billion remaining authorized for share repurchase. Now moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2024.\nBased on the strong demand experienced in the third quarter, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to be approximately $4.15 billion, up from our previous guidance of approximately $4.025 billion. This increase now equates to full year growth expectations of approximately 14% versus last year. From a brand perspective, we now expect UGG revenue growth of low double digits up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits. This full year increase is the result of the strong DTC demand that we experienced and fulfilled in the third quarter. Full year HOKA revenue growth of approximately 25%, with strong third quarter sell-through driving wholesale refill upside in the fourth quarter, reflecting our disciplined marketplace management. In addition to our fiscal year 2024 updated revenue outlook, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 54.5%. As UGG experienced high levels of full price selling, including Key Styles contributing incremental margin from price increases as brand heat continued to drive strong demand. SG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be approximately 34.5% as we have identified areas to accelerate spend in Q4 with revenue growth exceeding expectations for fiscal year 2024.\nWe believe this additional spend, part of which represents top-of-funnel marketing opportunities, gives our brands the opportunity to defend their current positions of strength, setting the foundation for the future. Additionally, I would note that some of the third and fourth quarter spending timing dynamics related to unrealized FX gains recorded in Q3 that we expect will be offset in Q4 as rates have recently moved in the opposite direction. With these updates, we are increasing our operating margin for the year and now expect it to be approximately 20%, reflecting the improvement in gross margin experienced. Our effective tax rate is now projected to be approximately 22%. And finally, with these updates, we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectations to now be in the range of $26.25 to $26.50. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate.\nThis guidance update represents a $3.25 increase on the prior top end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range. Based on the success that we've seen this year with strong sell-through and high levels of full price selling, there are a few business dynamics related to the fourth quarter that we would like to highlight, including U.S. wholesale shipments that went out at the tail end of the third quarter of this year that have historically occurred in the fourth quarter. Meaningful revenue from UGG closeouts last year that will not repeat this year and low levels of inventory on Key Styles that have been driving the business this fiscal year. We, of course, still expect to deliver a strong fourth quarter that is now projected to round out Decker's fourth consecutive year of at least mid-teens top line revenue growth, while also consistently delivering exceptional high levels of operating profitability. We would note that some of the benefit to our operating profitability we're seeing are outsized and may not repeat in future years, but we remain dedicated to delivering operating profitability in the top tier among our peer group even as we continue to invest in our organization to enable future growth.\nAs we've said in the past, if revenue growth comes faster than our ability to keep pace with investments, some of the related profit expansion may flow through to the bottom line near term. However, we continue to recognize the importance of funding our strategic initiatives moving into next year and maintain a focus on the long-term vision for our brands. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach as we enter our final fiscal quarter and begin planning for next fiscal year. Our largest brands are 2 of the healthiest and most in demand in our industry. With a robust balance sheet and our diligent operating approach, we are well positioned to drive future success and look forward to providing more details on our year-end call. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThanks, Steve. We are extremely proud of our brand's year-to-date performance, which have produced record revenue and earnings results. As we look beyond fiscal year 2024, I believe we have an incredibly strong innovation pipeline for the UGG and HOKA brands, giving us further confidence in our ability to build upon this year's exceptional growth. Thinking into the next few years, we believe HOKA remains our primary growth vehicle with considerable opportunity for both region and category expansion as awareness of the brand's innovative performance product increases further, and continue to position UGG for growth through the development of category hybrids that celebrate heritage brand codes to resonate with target consumers across global markets. Decker's strategic focus on marketplace management, omnichannel strategy and flexible operating model continues to be the driving force behind our sustained success.\nWe remain focused on executing against our long-term objectives while continuing to deliver high levels of profitability and driving shareholder value. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our employees across the organization for their consistent and dedicated focus to driving results aligned with our long-term strategic vision. Our employees continue to go above and beyond while upholding Decker's values. Before we turn to Q&A, I want to give Stefano a moment to say a few words. Stefano?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nDave, thank you for the kind introduction, and good afternoon, everyone. It is a privilege to have been named Deckers next CEO.

With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. It's great to be here with you today to discuss our exceptional second quarter where our 2 marquee brands experienced high levels of full-price consumer demand, leading to revenue increasing 25% versus last year, eclipsing $1 billion for the first time in our September ending quarter, gross margin improving 520 basis points versus last year, and diluted earnings per share increasing nearly 80% versus last year to $6.82.\nOur direct-to-consumer business was the fastest-growing component of revenue growth in the second quarter, increasing nearly 40% versus last year, with HOKA growing 46% and UGG increasing 38% as both brands experienced a greater than 30% global increase in consumer acquisition. Our global wholesale business also put up strong revenue growth in the second quarter, increasing 19% versus last year, again, driven by our 2 largest brands, UGG and HOKA.\nOur wholesale accounts also continue to see incredible heat and momentum for our key styles across both brands. With this strong consumer demand, selling for wholesale in the quarter included some accelerated fall seasonal shipments benefiting our first half results and increasing our confidence to achieve our outlook for the fiscal year.\nAs we continue to focus on our strategic marketplace management, we are pleased to have captured the strong momentum of demand early in the year, particularly with these products capturing high levels of full price selling across all channels. As we focus on delivering the full year, I think it's important to reflect on our year-to-date performance. We closed out a record first half for Deckers with total portfolio revenue across all channels, growing 19% versus last year, driven by HOKA revenue increasing 27% from global strength across its ecosystem of access points, UGG revenue increasing 18% primarily from gains across international regions and global DTC, total portfolio, global DTC acquisition and retention, increasing 29% and 27%, respectively, and international revenue across all brands increasing 23% versus last year.\nWhile Steve will provide further details on our financial performance and related increased outlook later in the call. I'd like to emphasize how proud we are of the continued alignment of our strong, near-term performance with Decker's long-term objectives to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar performance brand, grow UGG through direct-to-consumer connections with elevated products and experiences, expand DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains, and drive international growth through targeted investments.\nWith that, let's get into the highlights of our successful first half, starting with HOKA. Global revenue in the first half increased 27% versus last year. This impressive result reflects the HOKA brand's successful marketplace management execution, which is driving more business to DTC in conjunction with market share gains from high full price sell-through at our existing points of wholesale distribution.\nHOKA revenue growth in the first half was led by direct-to-consumer, which increased 54% versus last year and represented 38% of revenue, up from 31% in the prior year. This was aided by global increases in brand awareness according to Decker's proprietary brand tracker study, consumer acquisition, which is up 47% versus last year and consumer retention, which is up 52% versus the prior year.\nHOKA experienced significant growth and awareness across all major markets, with the U.S. growing to approximately 30% and international regions on average, rising to mid-teens with much more room to grow. Specific to our gains in DTC in the first half, consumer acquisition in EMEA DTC nearly doubled to help achieve a 75% year-over-year increase in channel revenue for the region.\nThis represents great progress for our EMEA region, and though DTC remains a relatively small percentage of its total revenue, we see this expansion as a positive indicator that HOKA is increasingly resonating with the European consumer. As we have demonstrated in the U.S., thoughtfully building brand awareness through marketing activations and strategic marketplace presence served as a catalyst to DTC acceleration as the brand begins to take hold with the local consumer.\nTo that end, HOKA recently opened its first European flagship store in Covent Garden in London, giving the brand a powerful presence in one of the most influential footwear markets around the world. In the U.S., HOKA continues to deliver exceptional growth. DTC revenue increased nearly 50% versus last year for the first half, with strong growth among 18- to 34-year-old retained consumers, which increased 70%. We believe some of this demand was fueled by HOKA having increased resonance in the back-to-school time frame with college age students.\nBrand loyalty among this group is especially exciting given the increased potential lifetime value of repeat purchases. The HOKA marketing teams have done an exceptional job, building global brand awareness through compelling FLY HUMAN FLY campaign content, connecting with consumers at HOKA-sponsored events and highlighting the incredible performances of HOKA athletes. We continue to sponsor key running events around the globe as part of our commitment to support the sport and provide a platform to showcase our innovative performance products. This includes events from 5Ks to Elite ultramarathons for all types of athletes around the world, allowing us to elevate the brand with pinnacle performance minded consumers and also to broaden worldwide awareness of the achievements capable of HOKA products.\nThis year's HOKA sponsored UTMB, or Ultra-Trail Mont-Blanc World Series finals held in Chamonix, France is the perfect example of our team's 360-degree collaborative approach to building HOKA brand awareness and performance credibility. This trail running event allows us to celebrate the roots of HOKA, which was born in the French Alps, further connecting the brand with European consumers.\nAt the UTMB World Series Finals, the HOKA team set up a base camp that offered consumers the opportunity to engage with the brand in a unique way through athlete meet and greets, 24-hour product testing and shoe personalization. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the experience and are already looking forward to leveraging these learnings at future events. HOKA made its mark on the event, both from a product and athlete performance standpoint, with several impressive achievements, including HOKA athlete, Jim Walmsley making history becoming the first American man to win the Dacia UTMB, a 106-mile race that included more than 6 miles of elevation gain completing the course in a record time of less than 20 hours.\nHOKA ranking top among all brands with the most top 5 finishes across the series of 3 races and HOKA remaining the #1 brand won by UTMB participants. From a product standpoint, first half HOKA growth was driven by a variety of categories and styles, which includes, among others, the Clifton franchise, which benefited from the ninth edition launch as well as new successful lifestyle versions with Suede uppers, stability staples like the Arahi and Gaviota franchises, the latter of which launched its fifth edition during the second quarter as we are seeing increased adoption of this category from consumers. Trail and hike favorites, the Challenger and Anacapa franchise is benefiting from new innovations incorporated in recent updates; speed shoes highlighted by the Rocket X refresh and the all-new Mach X; and new lifestyle options, including the popular Solimar and Transport styles.\nWe remain encouraged by the breadth of category adoption across the innovative HOKA product assortment, which continues to evolve and attract new consumers to the brand. We are implementing greater segmentation across the ecosystem of HOKA access points to ensure our accounts are best positioned to serve their respective consumers and emphasize DTC as the pinnacle destination to experience the full depth of the brand's product offering.\nFor the balance of the year, the HOKA team remains focused on executing its marketplace management strategy, which includes a focus on building global brand awareness and heat to increase demand which is helping to drive high full price sell-through at DTC and across wholesale, allowing the brand to deliver healthy growth with best-in-class margins and inventory turns. Complemented by several new innovative product launches coming up in our fourth quarter, we expect HOKA to continue delivering strong results for the remainder of this fiscal year and well beyond.\nNow shifting to UGG. Global revenue in the first half increased 18% versus last year. The brand's strong first half performance was driven primarily by high levels of brand heat, disciplined marketplace management leading to product scarcity on key styles exiting last fall and intentional pull forward of the brand's fall marketing campaign relative to past years. We currently have the most cohesive, globally aligned product, marketing and consumer targeting strategy I've ever seen for UGG. Marketplace management has been a core strength of the UGG brand for some time now.\nThe allocation and segmentation of core and popular new styles continues to serve the brand well, helping drive high levels of full price sell-through. Last year, we shared that we did not fully capture demand on several key styles. As we began this fiscal year, we strategically developed targeted inventory that caters to the brand's most popular products and seeded fall marketing campaign Feels Like UGG in July as opposed to the typical September time frame.\nFrom July 15 to August 15, we saw a groundswell of influencer public service announcements, reminding consumers to buy UGG now. Videos using #UGG received over 25 million views during that time frame, and UGG saw twice the level of engagement on Instagram as compared to last year. We believe the UGG team's strategic marketing shift served as a catalyst for earlier fall consumer demand globally. In the U.S. specifically, this shift helped fuel greater back-to-school demand with search interest increasing 46% versus last year, according to Google Trends.\nTo keep this momentum going at the tail end of September, UGG celebrated the official kickoff of #UGG season with music superstar Cardi B, whose video announcement featuring the new classic dipper had nearly 20 million views. This resulted in significant press and media coverage of our launch with influential publications such as billboards, and Vogue featuring UGG. Brand heat created by the UGG team directly translated to incredible first half results, particularly from the global DTC business and international regions, which both experienced a revenue increase of above 25% versus last year.\nFurthermore, UGG gross margins benefited from transitional and fall products selling at full price during the second quarter. This dynamic is in contrast with prior years with the brand's DTC business has historically been more weighted towards end of spring and summer products that generally carry a lower average selling price. The Tasman franchise, including the [ TAS ] platform as well as the Classic Mini and Ultra Mini franchises have been the focal products of UGG search interest and revenue growth in the first half as expected.\nWe are also excited that some of the new fall franchises are beginning to resonate with consumers as well, including the aforementioned classic Dipper, a key globally marketed style, the all gender hybrid weather collection, which includes modernized weather-ready versions of the Tasman and Neumel and the Lowmel, a sneaker hybrid take on the original neumel. UGG is well positioned to capture consumer demand during the holiday season with great products like days. Considering the demand we've seen thus far, we are already in chase mode for a select group of popular items and colors for which we are expediting production to ensure greater DTC inventory through the season.\nThe UGG brand's first half growth sets us up well, especially when factoring the signals of a weakening global economy and lower consumer confidence. Given this dynamic, we are glad to have captured some demand earlier to help reduce the pressure of competing with more promotional brands during this upcoming holiday season as we seek to continue selling premium UGG products at full price.\nMoving on to our discussion of consolidated channel performance. Global growth was across both direct-to-consumer and wholesale, with DTC being the primary driver of revenue gains in the first half, increasing 37% versus last year. Our portfolio experienced DTC strength relative to last year across consumers with acquired and retained increasing 29% and 27%, respectively, brands with HOKA and UGG revenue increasing 54% and 26%, respectively, regions with international and domestic revenue increasing 48% and 34%, respectively, and channels as consumer demand was robust in stores and online.\nAdditionally, we saw a double-digit increase in average selling price as a result of a greater mix of HOKA, higher full price selling for UGG combined with a focus on fewer proven SKUs and more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Regarding global wholesale, revenue in the first half increased 11% versus last year. Growth was driven by strength in UGG and HOKA as well as across both our domestic and international regions. Market share gains continue to be the primary avenue of wholesale growth for HOKA, which is now the top-selling brand in U.S. run specialty stores in aggregate, according to third-party market sources.\nHOKA has also quickly become the top running brand with key strategic partners in applicable doors. Our teams are extremely proud of the HOKA brand's top market share achievement, which further validates the brand's performance rooted credibility. UGG wholesale performance in the first half is right in line with our strategy this year with international regions fueling the majority of growth, while the brand maintains its strong business in the U.S. With these first half results, it is clear that our marketplace management strategies are working well, positioning our brands to excel during the holiday quarter and capture increased consumer demand across their respective ecosystems of access points.\nBefore I hand it off to Steve to discuss our results in more detail, I'll note that we also announced our plan to divest Sanuk. At Deckers, we're focused on the most effective allocation of our resources that are in alignment with long-term objectives. Consumers have long valued Sanuk for its fun, innovative and comfort-first products. Over the coming months, we will work to find the right owner to support the brand's next chapter while we continue to execute our growth priorities. Thanks, everyone, and now I'll hand it over to Steve.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We are excited by the strong performance HOKA and UGG continue to exhibit through the first half of fiscal year 2024, stemming from our strategic marketplace management execution that continues to benefit our brands. As Dave covered, HOKA drove another quarter of strong growth, led by DTC, while UGG demonstrated broad-based growth across regions and channels by continuing to captivate consumers and elevate its presence around the world. .\nOur record second quarter revenue exemplifies the exceptional demand for our brands, and we look forward to continuing this momentum as we enter our largest and most complex fiscal quarter. While ongoing macroeconomic challenges persist, we believe we are well positioned to navigate this dynamic marketplace. With a strong financial framework and in-demand brands, we remain committed to building the foundation for success that drives long-term sustainable growth.\nNow let's get into the details of second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1.092 billion, representing an increase of 25% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 24% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong demand experienced across the HOKA DTC channel, which increased 46% versus last year and contributed to delivering total brand revenue of $424 million for the quarter and broad-based UGG growth across regions and channels, delivering $610 million of revenue with global DTC increasing 38% and wholesale increasing 25%.\nWith the HOKA brand's performance consistent with our expectation, the outsized UGG growth in the second quarter benefited from first, a higher level of wholesale shipments in Q2 this year that in the past couple of years were captured in the first quarter as transit times have reduced, supply chain logistics have improved and availability of inventory is more consistent relative to during the pandemic. Second, seeding the fall global UGG campaign earlier in the quarter reminding consumers of the scarcity that took place in the prior year, which created brand heat and demand for those same, popular styles that sold out quickly last year, driving earlier consumer purchasing this year; and third, an increased level of demand for the brand during the back-to-school period, which signaled some wholesalers to desire shipments on an accelerated time frame relative to our original plan.\nGross margin for the second quarter was 53.4%, up 520 basis points from last year's 48.2%. Second quarter gross margin benefited from lower ocean freight rates, favorable UGG product mix, partially driven by earlier fall demand, favorable UGG full price mix, favorable channel mix with DTC continuing to grow faster than wholesale and a slight benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was $358 million, up 22% versus last year's $294 million as we continue investing in key areas of the business.\nAs a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 32.8% versus 33.6% in the prior year, 80 basis points lower than last year. This resulted primarily from the aforementioned timing considerations regarding earlier consumer demand and timing of certain spend. Our tax rate was 23.8%, which compares to 21.2% for the prior year. These results culminated in diluted earnings per share of $6.82 for the quarter, which is just over $3 above last year's $3.80 diluted earnings per share, representing EPS growth of 79%.\nThis increase in diluted earnings per share was approximately evenly split between gross margin benefits and higher revenue, with a small benefit from a reduced share count resulting from the share repurchases made over the past year. Turning to our balance sheet at September 30, 2023. We ended September with $823 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $726 million, down 21% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $185 million worth of shares at an average price of $534.53. As of September 30, 2023, the company had approximately $1.1 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases.\n[Audio Gap] of low single digits. This upside comes from the continued strength of global brand heat driven by robust early demand. We still expect full year HOKA revenue growth of above 20%, with third quarter percentage growth anticipated to be slower due to this year's timing of product launches being weighted towards the fourth quarter. [Audio Gap] to be in the range of 52.5% to 53%, reflecting the strength of UGG full price selling in the second quarter as the brand was able to capture DTC demand early.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be in the range of 34% to 34.5%, as we continue to invest in key areas of the business. Operating margin is now expected to be approximately 18.5%, reflecting the improvement in the gross margin. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, and we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectation to now be in the range of $22.90 to $23.25. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, labor shortages and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are proud of the first half performance by the HOKA and UGG brands, 2 of the strongest in our industry. which led us to increase revenue guidance heading into the back half of our fiscal year despite what appears to be a more challenging macroeconomic environment. The HOKA brand's global gains in awareness, combined with the early fall demand we are seeing from UGG give us the confidence to achieve this exceptional outlook. Thanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThanks, Steve. HOKA and UGG have delivered incredible results for the first half, and we believe our company is well positioned to deliver on the increased full fiscal year objectives we outlined today. Marketplace management remains paramount to the ongoing success of Deckers and our continued ability to buck industry trends as we build awareness and drive demand for our brands.\nOur proficiency in the implementation and delivery of strategic objectives is what truly differentiates Deckers as an organization, allowing our brands to create lasting consumer connections.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss another strong quarter for Deckers, starting off fiscal year 2024 on the right path as we build towards delivering another year of great results.\nOur results give us increased confidence to achieve our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2024, which includes a raise to our prior expectations. For the first quarter, our performance slightly outpaced our expectations with revenue increasing 10% versus last year to $676 million, gross margin improving more than 300 basis points including beneficial brand and channel mix dynamics and diluted earnings per share growing 45% to $2.41.\nRevenue growth versus last year was driven by our key areas of focus with global HOKA expanding 27% to deliver $420 million, global DTC increasing 35% to represent 37% of portfolio revenue, up from 30% last year and international UGG delivering strong growth. As anticipated, we had some offsets to the growth in the quarter due to timing dynamics in UGG U.S. wholesale with accounts choosing to receive product spread later into the year, as opposed to a front-loaded preference we saw in the last couple of years.\nAs we look to best manage our wholesale account product flow, we also continue to monitor marketplace inventory levels to maintain a healthy omnichannel presence that services our end consumer in the best way possible and preserves the premium nature of our brands. Our ability to propel the targeted opportunities of global HOKA, global DTC and international UGG further demonstrates the success of our omnichannel marketplace management and strategic investments. We will continue to remain nimble in our execution as we always have, to deliver strong results on both the top and bottom line.\nWith the continued execution of our long-term vision, we believe Deckers is emerging as a leading creator of compelling consumer connections through highly desirable products that infuse disruptive innovation across both fashion and performance. As a reminder, our long-term strategic vision remains focused on building HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, growing the UGG brand by connecting with consumers through elevated experiences and a segmented product offering, expanding our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and driving international growth through strategic investments.\nSteve will provide further details around our increased forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, let's dive into the brand and channel performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Starting with the brand highlights. As mentioned, global HOKA revenue increased 27% versus last year to $420 million, a quarterly record and the first time the brand eclipsed $400 million in a single quarter. The HOKA brand's well-managed ecosystem of access points continues to flourish.\nDTC was the primary growth driver in the quarter, increasing 63% versus last year and accounting for approximately 2/3 of total brand growth. DTC growth was broad-based as each region grew the business more than 50% versus the prior year. Global consumer acquisition increased 58%, Global consumer retention increased 57% and 18- to 34-year-old consumers in the U.S. increased 68%. This exceptional DTC demand resulted in an improvement in gross margin as HOKA maintained high levels of full price selling and continues to benefit from shifting a greater proportion of revenue mix to DTC.\nWhile the HOKA brand's DTC business is still predominantly e-commerce, our select retail stores are augmenting the brand's presence by increasing awareness and brand engagement with the physical presence in key strategic markets, creating personal consumer connections through community-oriented experiences and broadening category adoption by showcasing the depth of the HOKA product offering.\nFor these reasons, we expect to continue testing potential permanent locations through pop-up doors. We are excited about a couple of new doors that are in the pipeline and look forward to sharing more soon.\nFrom a wholesale perspective, HOKA continues to drive growth and manage the marketplace to build market share in existing points of distribution, maintain high levels of full price sell-through, increased category shelf space through differentiated products and expand brand awareness with a broader consumer demographic.\nHOKA has preserved high levels of full price sell-through and remains one of the fastest turning brands within the majority of its wholesale accounts. We continue to tightly manage marketplace inventory and closely monitor HOKA key performance indicators in the channel to ensure the brand maintains its premium positioning across its ecosystem of access points.\nAs excess consumer demand materializes, we prefer that HOKA satisfies upside through the brand's DTC business, which is what we saw happen this quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum that HOKA has sustained across this distribution landscape and continue to make investments to build awareness and affinity for the brand across key markets.\nIn June, HOKA launched the second edition of its FLY HUMAN FLY global marketing campaign and is already seeing the benefits of this upgraded rollout. This addition of the campaign was designed to reinforce that HOKA stands for joyful and inclusive performance at its highest level. As campaign content and activations continue to roll out across the globe, HOKA has seen a powerful response from consumers in the first few weeks, including robust growth in online engagement across social channels and digital platforms, especially with the release of the campaign's focal film titled Murmuration which embodies the brand ethos of moving together.\nHeightened attention brought directly to hoka.com with the vast majority of digital campaign asset clicks yielding first-time visitors to our brand's e-commerce platform globally, more than doubling the conversion rate of hoka.com landing page visitors and significant impressions from out-of-home activations. We are optimistic about the reach and broad appeal of this campaign as HOKA continues to introduce itself to new consumers around the world. And the brand is as visible as it's ever been with connected TV advertising, billboards, special running events and several compelling activations in the pipeline.\nOn the heels of the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign rollout, HOKA launched the all-new Mach X which was designed for propulsive everyday running and features high rebound cushioning and a [ Pebax ] plate. Mach X media content was seamlessly weave into the FLY HUMAN FlY launch and HOKA further celebrated this innovative product creation with several regional activations to aid Mach X awareness including a demo run in Germany, where participants were challenged to run as far as they could for 30 minutes, a sprint relay in France across a 2-kilometer loop in Las [indiscernible], a college event in Eugene, Oregon, hosting demo community runs to celebrate the U.S. track and field championships and a 2-day HOKA experience clinic at our retail store in Japan and at our pop-up location in Thailand.\nThese global events, combined with the connected TV, social media and digital out-of-home content have created significant energy behind the HOKA brand's latest shoe innovation. The Mach X was treated as an exclusive launch in our own DTC channel and with our run specialty partners as we continue to work towards greater segmentation of the HOKA brand's compelling product line.\nJust a few weeks into the second quarter, the Mach X is close to cracking the top 10 sellers globally on hoka.com, and we are getting great feedback so far from our run specialty partners.\nHOKA continues to build a bigger business through the expansion and increased adoption of this lineup of innovative products. We see the Mach X as an incremental addition to the already stellar portfolio of footwear, led by the brand's most popular styles, [ Clifton and Bondi ]. The Mach X is a great example of franchise development where the team has innovated upon the original Mach, which continues to perform exceptionally well by introducing the snappier and more competitive version, the Mach X.\nIt is with this approach to product line management that HOKA is able to broaden the aperture of HOKA consumers while maintaining pinnacle positioning in the performance athletic space. HOKA has an amazing roster of athletes around the world who are competing at the highest level and achieving incredible results were in commercially available versions of our shoes. During this past quarter, HOKA athlete Cole Watson finished first in the Canyons Endurance 100k, wearing the HOKA Tecton X carbon plated trail running shoe. Congratulations to Cole, who with this victory punches ticket to the UTMB Mont Blanc, a HOKA sponsored event to be held in [ Chamoy ], France at the end of August.\nMoving to UGG. Global revenue in the first quarter decreased 6% versus last year to $196 million. As expected, this decline resulted from lapping earlier wholesale shipping patterns over the last couple of years in the U.S. UGG was able to offset this challenging compare in the U.S. with the strength of the brand's international regions. International strength was broad-based across multiple regions and in both wholesale and DTC channels.\nIn particular, our EMEA region as well as China, which benefited from lapping lower demand from lockdowns in the prior year drove above-average growth. These regions found success attracting consumers with more transitional styles like the Ultra Mini, Tasman and Classic Mini as well as seasonal franchises like the Golden Star and LA Cloud. We are encouraged by the continued progress of international regions to increase the adoption of key global franchises year-round.\nPart of the excitement behind these franchises is being driven by the brand's more focused approach to product marketing creating greater global alignment of key stories. With this more focused approach, UGG is maintaining high levels of brand heat with more consumers actively searching for the brand. During the first quarter, online search interest across Europe increased 60% versus last year with outsized strength in the U.K. and France. The same is true in the U.S., where search interest increased 21% versus last year, according to Google Trends.\nUGG brand momentum also benefited from this spring's field house activation at Coachella. The field house, first launched in the fall of 2022 and is a multisensory community experience dedicated to making self-expression comfortable for all. UGG invited individuals from around the world to experience this latest iteration of the field house, which was designed as an oasis for creatives in Palm Springs, California.\nThe field house was decorated with signature artwork from New York City-based artist Kid Super, who partnered with UGG to design a quick strike collaboration of the Tasman X. This global activation drove significant press coverage with the likes of influential publications such as Esquire, Teen Vogue, Daily Mail and Hype Beast. As a result of the UGG team's continued brand activations and compelling products, UGG global DTC increased 6% versus last year. UGG experienced consumer demand, both in stores and online. We have been particularly excited by the interest of consumers who are shopping in person, especially during the spring and summer seasons. We believe this dynamic is partly attributable to the development and greater adoption of transitional franchises that embrace the brand's heritage DNA and have greater year-round wearing occasions.\nBy maintaining this momentum, the entire UGG product portfolio benefits, especially in our stores where consumers can feel and directly engage with the broader product offering. For this reason, and in line with our focus to elevate the UGG brand in an influential international market, subsequent to quarter end, we opened our newest flagship store in the high tourist traffic Harajuku shopping district of Tokyo.\nWith the first quarter behind us, we remain confident in executing the UGG plan we outlined for fiscal year 2024, evidenced by the continued momentum of global markets as consumers actively search for UGG growth of global direct-to-consumer with improved margins from full-price business and strength of iconic silhouettes like the Ultra Mini and Tasman driving year-round excitement.\nEntering the second quarter, the UGG team is working hard to stage its global omnichannel marketplace to connect with consumers through engaging experiences in the autumn/winter season. To execute this vision, UGG will be expanding on and embracing the celebration of culture and community by creating meaningful experiences such as the field house that serve as an invitation to develop an emotional connection with the brand.\nThis fall, UGG will celebrate its brand heritage to consumer-centric moments around the world with new winter lifestyle themed field house executions, an exciting new winter product aimed at capturing more of the winter fashion and resort-focused consumer.\nShifting to our discussion of consolidated channel performance. Global direct-to-consumer drove first quarter revenue growth increasing 35% versus the prior year on a reported basis and 33% on a comparable basis. Strength in the channel was driven by continued increases in HOKA consumer acquisition and retention globally. HOKA consumer growth was robust across regions and various age demographics, with outsized growth among international markets and the 18- to 34-year-old cohort, which remain key targets for us.\nThe UGG DTC business also experienced growth, driven by a more than 20% increase internationally that benefited from China catching up from lockdowns in the prior year. The strength in China resulted from increased adoption of both sneaker and sandal styles. From a wholesale perspective, global revenue was down 1% as gains in HOKA were offset by UGG U.S. shipment timing realignment to pre-pandemic cadence as well as a continued focus to manage the marketplace inventory of our brands to maintain high levels of full price selling in this more promotional consumer landscape.\nOverall, we are pleased with these channel results, which reflect the power of our marketplace management strategies that continue to benefit in our wholesale partners, DTC business and ultimately, Decker's bottom line. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our increased outlook for fiscal year 2024. Steve?\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered strong results in the first quarter and demonstrated great progress toward our full fiscal year and raised outlook. HOKA was the driver of growth in the quarter, led by strong performance in the DTC channel, and UGG continues to elevate its presence globally as represented by international growth.\nAs anticipated, UGG global revenue was lower than last year, primarily due to lapping earlier sell-in during the prior year but the brand maintains high levels of consumer interest, capturing increased demand through our DTC in the quarter.\nAs we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment, we remain committed to executing against our strategic priorities and maintaining our disciplined approach to managing our business. We are encouraged by the demand signals we are seeing and believe our portfolio of leading brands continues to resonate with consumers globally. With that, let's get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results.\nRevenue was $676 million, up 10% versus prior year. HOKA revenue increased 27% versus last year due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brand's DTC channel and global ecosystem of access points. Gross margins for the quarter was 51.3%, which is up 330 basis points from last year's 48%. First quarter gross margin benefited from lower freight costs, a greater mix of HOKA brand revenue and an increased mix of DTC business with slight offsets from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the same period last year and select closeouts of seasonal inventory.\nSG&A dollar spend in the first quarter was $276 million, which is up 16% from last year's $238 million. SG&A growth was driven by reinvestment in key areas of the business in support of our growth targets, which includes strategic marketing, including the spend intended to amplify HOKA awareness in leading international markets. Supply chain footprint to match the growing scale of our organization, enhanced e-commerce capabilities and talent across the organization, including areas we've delayed in the enterprise support functions.\nOur tax rate was 21.9%, which compares to 21.3% in the prior year. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as a result of our share repurchase program drove diluted earnings per share of $2.41 for the quarter which was $0.75 above last year's $1.66 per share, representing growth of 45%.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2023, we ended June with $1.05 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $741 million, down 12% versus the same point in time last year and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $25 million worth of shares at an average price of $485.95. As of June 30, 2023, the company had approximately $1.3 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\nNow moving on to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2024. With the HOKA brand's DTC business exceeding our expectation in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year top line revenue guidance to be approximately $3.98 billion from our previous range of approximately $3.95 billion. This increase represents full year growth expectations of approximately 10% versus the prior year. As a result of this update, we now expect HOKA growth to exceed 20% for the fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 with the majority of growth anticipated to come from the brand's direct-to-consumer business.\nUGG revenue is still expected to increase low single digits driven by international expansion and a focus on driving more business to DTC. Beyond our updated revenue outlook for full fiscal year 2024, gross margin is still expected to be approximately 52%, representing a more than 150 basis point improvement relative to last year. SG&A is still expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we reinvest gross margin improvements in key areas of the business.\nOperating margin is still expected to be approximately 18%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be 22% to 23% and we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectation now to be in the range of $21.75 to $22.25. The $0.65 increase is related to the increased expectation for HOKA DTC and an increased expectation for interest income as we benefit from working capital improvements, including inventory management, driving higher cash balances that are earning at a higher interest rate.\nPlease note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from future share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which includes, but not limited to supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical tensions.\nWe remain confident in our disciplined operating model, well-positioned brands, robust financial profile and ability to remain nimble as we adapt to evolving marketplace dynamics. Thanks, everyone, and I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThanks, Steve. Fiscal year 2024 is off to a nice start with HOKA continuing its strong momentum and the balance of our brand portfolio on track to our full year expectations. While keeping our long-term strategies top of mind, we are operating fiscal year 2024 with a sharp focus to prioritize DTC growth across all of our brands while managing wholesale marketplace inventory to drive online acquisition and a high level of full price selling, expand HOKA brand awareness globally, lead with UGG products that have proven to resonate with global consumers, thoughtfully manage inventory to align with consumer demand and invest in enterprise infrastructure in key strategic growth areas.\nWe believe Decker's unique ability to infuse exciting innovation into both fashion and performance products is why our differentiated brands are able to create lasting consumer connections.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, as always, for joining us today. I am delighted to be here today to discuss another exceptional year for Deckers, as we delivered record results on both the top and bottom line and continue to progress against our long-term strategic initiatives. For fiscal year 2023, our brands achieved revenue growth of 15% on a reported basis versus the prior year to more than $3.6 billion, which is 42% and $1.1 billion above revenue 2 years ago.\nOperating margin in line with the high end of our guidance range at 18%, which is top tier in our industry and a more than $3 increase in earnings per share, representing a 19% increase versus last year. Specifically, our progress in fiscal year 2023 includes HOKA driving global revenue growth of 58% versus last year to eclipse $1.4 billion. UGG revenue holding steady in constant currency with the brand increasing its mix of both direct-to-consumer and international business; global portfolio DTC adding more than $0.25 billion of incremental revenue, growing at nearly twice the rate of wholesale; and our international markets increasing 20% versus the prior year on a reported basis, which when accounting for an approximate $100 million headwind from currency fluctuations, increased 30% in constant currency.\nReflecting on the past few years, our company's performance is remarkable, particularly given the consumer climate and speed with which we have had to build our infrastructure to support this incredible growth. We still have much more work ahead to build upon the foundation for long-term sustainable growth, but I'm truly proud of how far we have come. We believe that the strength of our operations, omnichannel management and brand teams have enabled our organization to improve resilient and capable of achieving the goals we have set forth, including driving significant top line growth, while maintaining an 18% operating margin and reducing inventories to more appropriate levels.\nI want to thank our employees and our tremendous leaders across the organization for their hard work and collaboration that contributed to Decker's outstanding execution. Steve will provide further details on fiscal year 2023 results and what's ahead for fiscal year 2024.\nBut first, I will share more about our 2023 brand and channel performance. Starting with the brand highlights. Global HOKA revenue for fiscal year 2023 increased 58% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. This is the fourth consecutive year HOKA has delivered revenue growth above 50%. For the year, HOKA growth was driven by a more than 30% increase in global brand awareness in fall 2022; an acceleration of DTC, which grew 85% versus the prior year; broader category adoption; market share growth with existing points of wholesale distribution; and additional access points with our strategic partners, which was complemented by increased availability of product inventory and an improved supply chain environment.\nIn June of 2022, HOKA launched FLY HUMAN FLY, its first-ever globally integrated marketing campaign. The campaign was designed to build awareness and elevate the HOKA brand in the minds of global consumers through rich storytelling and targeted activations in key cities. The HOKA team utilized connected TV and digital and out-of-home channels to reach a broader audience with creative that combined emotionally connected brand and product messaging.\nAs a result of the investments behind this campaign, HOKA awareness increased across a broad spectrum of key markets, such as the U.S., France, the U.K., China and Germany, with 3 of those countries increasing awareness more than 40% compared to fall 2021. Given the success the brand has experienced, we continue to see a significant opportunity for growth in each of our markets over the long term.\nSpecifically, we are working to close the awareness gap between the U.S. and international regions to build a more global brand. The HOKA marketing team has done a fantastic job developing insights from the initial campaign to evolve the next iteration of FLY HUMAN FLY, which will focus on the brand's roots and performance through inclusive storytelling that emphasizes the joy of movement for everybody. Stay tuned for more details on the campaign when it launches next month.\nOn the direct-to-consumer business, the HOKA brand's exceptional growth helped drive a 5 percentage point increase in DTC mix up to 34% of total brand revenue as compared to 29% in the prior year. Importantly, HOKA continues to bring new consumers into the brand, while also retaining existing consumers, evidenced by a 78% increase in acquisition and an 81% increase in retention as compared to last year.\nMomentum with younger consumers in the U.S. helped drive these increases as HOKA more than doubled the number of purchasers aged 18 to 34 years old. As HOKA continues to expand, we are encouraged by the broader product adoption from consumers beyond the brand's heritage running styles. We've seen this trend among DTC consumers and continue to gain category shelf space with wholesalers.\nAmong DTC purchasers in the U.S. and EMEA, multi-category purchases increased 79% and 127% versus last year, respectively. Across all channels, HOKA more than doubled revenue on trail and hike products aided by the Speedgoat and Challenger updates as well as market share gains with the Kaha and Anacapa franchises and fitness and recovery products benefiting from greater overrecovery sandal adoption and the introduction of both the Solimar and Transport Styles.\nWith the success HOKA is experiencing across a variety of innovative products, we're very excited to now offer a selection of our most popular items to the next generation of HOKA athletes with the brand's recently launched first ever use collection through our DTC channel and with very select wholesale partners. We view the opportunity with kids as an avenue to further expose the brand to parents and younger athletes over the long term.\nIn terms of HOKA wholesale for fiscal year 2023, revenue increased 47% versus the prior year, driven by market share gains with existing points of distribution, which accounted for approximately 2/3 of global dollar growth and additional access points with strategic partners. HOKA continues to prioritize delivering a pinnacle experience with performance products with the brand's exceptional run and outdoor specialty partners, while expanding the addressable market through strategic relationships that broaden brand awareness beyond the traditional specialty consumer.\nWith expanded distribution, HOKA is placing greater emphasis on the segmentation to align product and marketing with the respective distribution partners target consumer. HOKA is leveraging the run and outdoor specialty channel to maintain authenticity and brand credibility by offering exclusive high-performance products that are only available at DTC and select specialty doors.\nMarketplace management continues to be a top priority for HOKA as the brand enters fiscal year 2024. At the current scale north of $1.4 billion, our focus is to protect the HOKA brand's premium positioning and maintain a pull model. HOKA plans to emphasize growth in the DTC channel, driving high full price sell-through and building market share with existing points of wholesale distribution, especially in light of a dynamic consumer environment.\nThis focus on marketplace management will be particularly evident in our EMEA region as HOKA expects to prioritize low levels of promotion in the coming year. Steve will get into more specifics on our HOKA outlook later in the call, but I'd like to congratulate the HOKA team for delivering another special year and look forward to the brand's continued success in the upcoming year and well beyond.\nMoving to UGG. Global revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.9 billion, which is down 3% versus last year on a reported basis, but up slightly in constant currency. UGG performed in line with expectations as the brand focused on driving growth through DTC and international markets, while facing tough comparisons from the prior year related to refilling domestic wholesale inventories as well as currency exchange rate pressures overseas.\nDespite these unique dynamics, UGG maintained high levels of brand heat and demand, as evidenced by the strength of global DTC acquisition and retention, which increased 16% and 15% versus last year, respectively. While this is a tremendous growth figure in terms of worldwide consumers, we have been even more encouraged by the trends in our international markets, where acquisition was up 29% and retention increased 37% over the prior year.\nEMEA was the fastest-growing DTC region across the globe, aided by an 80% increase in new visitors to ugg.com in Europe. Helping drive the buzz around UGG, the brand was featured in a number of highly respected fashion publications, including and Harper's Bazaar, each touting the brand's fashion relevance. The UGG team has done an excellent job executing a brand-appropriate collaboration strategy over the past few years, which continues to benefit awareness and increase visibility with target consumers.\nMost recently, UGG partnered with London-based Gate Brand Palace; LA-based lifestyle brand, Madhappy. And just a few weeks ago, UGG launched an exciting new collaboration centered around the Tasman with New York-based fashion brand opening ceremony. We believe the UGG brand's focused on winning with younger consumers through strategic collaborations, presence on fashion week runways around the world and product designs rooted in brand DNA have been key drivers of building this excitement internationally and maintaining record levels of brand heat in the U.S.\nReflecting this exceptional demand for UGG, search interest in the U.S. increased 26% versus last year according to Google Trends. Additionally, from a purchasing perspective, UGG continue to over-index with 18- to 34-year-olds, which increased 21% versus last year, outpacing all other age groups and remaining the largest cohort of UGG consumers in the U.S. UGG products that drove demand in this fiscal year included Heritage Classics like the Short and Mini, fashion updates to core styles such as the Platform Classics, New and hybrid styles like the Ultra Mini and Tasman. The popularity of these items reflects the brand's consumer appeal across an exciting range of products helped by the successful category diversification strategy the UGG brand has been working towards over the last 5 years.\nNow more than ever, the UGG brand is leaning into its consumer-first approach, sharpening the product lines to create a cohesive consumer experience that feeds product strategy through direct engagement and insights. The brand plans to concentrate on product families featuring recognizable brand codes consumers love and expect from UGG while reducing inefficient SKUs.\nOver time, we believe this strategy will drive better margins and greater efficiencies, allowing for more selectful and impactful storytelling across a globally aligned and focused UGG product offering. UGG is now transitioning to the next phase of growth. Over the past several years, the brand has successfully established heightened consumer attention and increased global brand heat through product propositions that are both complementary and counter seasonal to its core lineup.\nThis work increased the UGG brand's connection with consumers, established a permission to play in new categories and reenergized the love for the brand's most iconic UGG silhouettes. In fiscal year 2024, the brand is placing greater emphasis on these icons, ensuring inventory is strategically weighted to meet demand for the most popular products and building on its foundation for healthy full-price growth across a variety of category and gender offerings in the future.\nOverall, UGG delivered a fantastic result given the challenges it faced both in terms of comparing to abnormal shipping timing and volumes and impacts from currency headwinds. The UGG team is developing compelling products through the integration of consumer data and insights within each layer of the product creation process. We are excited for the year ahead as the brand continues to build on the international opportunity and maintaining the exciting momentum over the last few years.\nTurning to Teva. Global revenue for fiscal year 2023 increased 12% versus last year to a record $183 million. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth for Teva as the brand continues to be a leader in the sports sandal category with aspirations to become a destination brand for the modern outdoor consumer. We are confident about the opportunity ahead for Teva as the brand works toward future growth through additional investments this fiscal year aimed at driving increased closet share over the next 5 years.\nFrom a channel performance perspective, fiscal year 2023 results were driven by strength across our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses, both of which drove more than $200 million of incremental revenue. For the year, DTC revenue on a reported basis increased 21% to nearly $1.5 billion, representing 40% of consolidated revenue. On a DTC comparable basis, revenue increased 23% versus last year, with healthy growth in both the physical and digital segments.\nGains in our direct-to-consumer business were driven by the continued momentum of global consumer acquisition and retention, which increased 28% and 29%, respectively, versus last year. We are encouraged that all major regions drove double-digit DTC growth in reported dollars, especially considering the significance of currency headwinds in our international markets.\nOn wholesale for the year, revenue increased 12% on a reported basis versus last year, which primarily reflects global market share gains for the HOKA brand, which was partially offset by a reduction of UGG domestic wholesale revenue as we did not repeat the fill-in activity that occurred in fiscal year 2022. The success we are seeing with both DTC and wholesale is a testament to our omnichannel brand and marketplace management.\nMaintaining the authentic and premium positioning of our brands in their respective markets continues to be our top priority, especially as we navigate an ongoing dynamic consumer environment. With that, I'll hand over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2024. Steve?\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered another outstanding result for fiscal year 2023 with double-digit top line growth, even with substantial foreign currency headwind and once again delivered a high-teen operating margin. Decker's flexible operating model and financial discipline continue to serve us well as we react to a fluid macroeconomic environment.\nOur omnichannel brand management and marketing teams have collaborated to create and capitalize on high levels of brand heat and demand for our brands while maintaining the high percentage of full-price selling, leading to record earning levels in fiscal year 2023. Decker's commitment to long-term strategic priorities, coupled with our execution and financial discipline, are the foundation for success as our portfolio of strong brands continue to drive long-term profitable growth in the years ahead.\nWith that, let's get into a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $792 million, representing an increase of 8% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by continued momentum with HOKA, including the brand nearly doubling last year's DTC revenue as well as strength in Teva as the brand recaptured revenue lost in the previous year due to supply chain disruption. This was partially offset by a reduction in UGG revenue as the brand lapped abnormal wholesale shipping patterns in the prior year from pandemic-related supply chain issues and experienced more normalized DTC demand.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter was 50%, a 130 basis point increase from the prior year period. The improved gross margin primarily relates to reduced air freight usage, favorable brand and channel mix from the strength of the HOKA DTC business and lower ocean freight rates, which were partially offset by increased promotional activity for UGG as the brand sought to reduce inventory levels of noncore seasonal product and continued headwinds from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nSG&A for the quarter was $290 million, representing 36.7% of revenue, which compares to last year's $277 million and 37.7% of revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down year-over-year as we gained leverage on marketing, where we avoided spend in areas of overperformance. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as a result of our share repurchase program, drove a diluted earnings per share increase of $0.95 to $3.46, which compares to $2.51 in the prior year period, representing a 38% increase.\nWith the strength of our fourth quarter, Deckers delivered exceptional full year fiscal 2023 results, which includes revenue increasing 15% on a reported basis versus last year to a record $3.63 billion. As compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by HOKA as the brand added more than $0.5 billion through global expansion across its well-managed ecosystem of access points and benefited from an improved supply chain and logistics environment.\nGross margins for the year was 50.3%, down 70 basis points versus last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher levels of promotion and lower-margin closeouts, entire ocean freight rates in the first half with positive offsets from reduced levels of air freight, a greater mix of HOKA brand revenue including benefits from price increases and an increased mix of DTC business.\nSG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.17 billion, up 12% versus the prior year's $1.04 billion. SG&A represented 32.3% of revenue, which is 80 basis points below last year. SG&A leverage as compared to last year was driven primarily by lower marketing spend as a percentage of revenue as we reduced spending in areas where inventory was short to help offset currency headwinds and delayed some spend targeted to build awareness.\nThis all resulted in a full fiscal year 2023 operating margin of 18%, which is 10 basis points above last year, despite significant currency headwinds. For the year, our effective tax rate was 22.4%, which is above last year's 20%. Taxes were higher this year, primarily as a result of changes in jurisdictional mix of business. Our strong performance, along with higher interest income and a lower share count that resulted from share repurchase, culminated in a record diluted earnings per share of $19.37, which represents a 19% increase over last year's $16.26.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2023, we ended the year with $982 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $533 million, up 5% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital at approximately 35%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $103 million worth of shares at an average price per share of $421.53.\nFor the entire fiscal year 2023, we repurchased over 900,000 shares for approximately $297 million at an average price per share of $320.35. At March 31, 2023, the company still had approximately $1.4 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\nNow moving to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect top line revenue of approximately $3.95 billion, representing growth of approximately 9% versus the prior year, with HOKA as our main growth engine, increasing in the range of 20% versus the prior year as we prioritize marketplace management expecting the majority of the growth in the brand's DTC channel and with wholesale growth assuming no net new doors added globally.\nUGG increasing low single digits, driven by international expansion and a relatively flat U.S. marketplace as we focus on driving the full price business by maintaining the brand's pull model. And DTC growth once again outpacing wholesale as we drive consumer acquisition and retention, margin improvement and prioritized marketplace management. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 52%, which is more than 150 basis points above last year as we are anticipating favorability from increasing DTC mix, increasing HOKA mix, with slight offsets from promotions, which we expect to be higher than last year as we anticipate a consumer environment that may have greater uncertainty.\nCurrency and freight are expected to be slight net tailwinds to our gross margin for the full fiscal year, but we expect to see headwind and tailwind fluctuations between quarters when compared to last year. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we reinvest gross margin improvements in key areas of the business, which include talent across the organization, including areas we've delayed in the enterprise, supply chain footprint to match the growing scale of our organization, e-commerce capabilities and strategic marketing, which includes HOKA spend to grow awareness in leading international markets.\nThrough the reinvestment of gross margin improvements into critical operating expense areas, we expect to maintain an approximate 18% operating margin in line with what we've delivered in fiscal year 2023. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. This all results in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $21.10 to $21.60.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million, which is above last year as we invest in capital IT projects, retail refreshment, including opening select new strategic locations and bolster our supply chain and warehouse capabilities. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases.\nAdditionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical tensions.\nWith a focus on delivering the full fiscal year, we will not be providing formal quarterly guidance per normal course. However, given we are halfway through the first quarter, we wanted to provide some context around our expectations for the quarter ending June 30. These include revenue growth slightly below the 9% full fiscal year guide as UGG is not expected to repeat the early U.S. wholesale shipments that the brand had experienced over the last couple of years during the first quarter and HOKA international wholesale growth anticipated to be slower due to not repeating the earlier distributor shipments that occurred in last year's first quarter.\nGross margin is expected to be similar to the full fiscal year guided rate and SG&A dollar growth is planned to be up double digits as we anticipate significant deleverage in the first quarter due to the phasing of certain investments. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle\n\nThanks, Steve. We continue to remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities and driving progress towards our long-term vision, while actively managing the marketplace for our brands to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, continue to grow the UGG brand by connecting with consumers through elevated experiences and a segmented product offering, expand our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive growth in international markets through strategic investments.\nThese strategies, coupled with our disciplined operating model, position us well to drive the development of our portfolio of powerful brands while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability as a global organization. Again, I'd like to emphasize some of the points Steve outlined in our guidance for fiscal year 2024.\nTo summarize, we plan to grow DTC faster than wholesale as we prioritize marketplace management and direct-to-consumer acquisition, focus on UGG products with a recognizable brand codes to feed the global momentum with young consumers, continue to manage inventory to align with our consumer demand and invest behind key strategies and infrastructure to further bolster our organization to support our scaling business.\nOn behalf of our entire team, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and support in helping us drive record levels of earnings in fiscal year 2023. Our results demonstrate the strength of our brands, people and our commitment to delivering value to all of our stakeholders. We are incredibly proud of our accomplishments across the whole Deckers organization and look forward to building on this success in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to be here today highlighting another record quarter for Deckers Brands as our teams were once again able to successfully execute against our long-term strategic objectives to deliver standout results in a dynamic consumer environment.\nOur fiscal third quarter record-setting results include $1.35 billion in consolidated revenue, reflecting a reported 13% increase versus the prior year and diluted earnings per share of $10.48. Key areas of progress during the third quarter included HOKA delivering record revenue of $352 million as the brand more than doubled its DTC business while demonstrating momentum across the product line and significantly increased wholesale through both market share gains and select new strategic access points. UGG increasing its mix of business in DTC to 60% up from 54% last year as the brand drove an 8% increase in the channel. Total portfolio DTC increasing 19% versus last year, to represent 52% of volume with both HOKA and UGG contributing to this mix shift, an all-time high for the third quarter and our international revenue increasing 12% on a reported basis and growing 25% on a constant currency basis when adjusting for the significant FX headwinds.\nDeckers delivered exceptional performance in the quarter and continued progress with respect to our long-term objectives. Notably, our brands commanded strong full price selling despite a highly promotional marketplace during the holiday season. While our brands did experience more normalized promotions relative to extremely low levels in the past few years, we were able to avoid significant discounting due to the strength of consumer demand for our products as well as disciplined marketplace management through our omnichannel approach.\nI'm thankful for the leaders throughout our organization, who continue to prioritize long-term brand health and remain committed to our strategic pillars allowing Deckers to maintain top-tier profitability. Our brands are well positioned for calendar 2023 as we end our fiscal year 2024 in April. Steve will provide further details on our updated guidance for this fiscal year as well as how we're thinking about the arduous macroeconomic environment.\nFor now, let's get into the brand highlights for the third quarter, starting with UGG. Global UGG revenue in the third quarter was $930 million, down 2% versus last year on a reported basis, but up low single digits on a constant currency basis. Overall, consumer demand for UGG was strong in the quarter as the brand delivered global gains in DTC across genders and categories, driven by a 21% increase in acquired consumers and a 17% increase in retained consumers.\nThe UGG brand's healthy DTC performance was offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impacts across all channels as well as lower wholesale revenue. This wholesale decline resulted from the unique shipment timing dynamics discussed at the outset of this fiscal year, which included an expectation that the third quarter would be impacted. Specifically, these earlier shipments drove temporarily elevated levels of inventory in the channel. As a result, and in line with our marketplace management strategies, the UGG brand's attention shifted to selling through product already in the channel to strategically reduce marketplace inventory, allowing DTC to capture demand upside and limiting the need for excess promotional activity.\nFrom a style and franchise perspective, UGG continues to find success with fresh updates of iconic styles. Throughout the year, consumers have continued to migrate to fashions that are uniquely UGG, such as the Classic Mini and Tasman as well as more versatile derivatives of these products. The consumer demand for these products was quite strong and certain style color combinations even led to out of stocks. Our measured approach to buying aimed at driving improved inventory levels, combined with the high level of demand for these products led to some scarcity in the marketplace. We see this approach as an effective tool to fuel demand, and we'll continue to optimize our pull model to balance future supply.\nWith respect to how these styles have performed, we are encouraged to see the continued strength of adoption from the brand's target segment of 18 to 34-year-olds. Among this segment in the U.S., the classic short remained the top seller, but the strongest growth came from the Classic Mini and Ultra Mini styles, which dragged second and third, respectively. Platform Classics are also extremely popular with this age group, likely resulting from the brand heat generated through unpaid product gifting to A-list celebrities, which helped drive the hashtag platform UGGs as the brand's #1 social trending topic in the quarter.\nAmong 18 to 34-year-old males in the U.S., UGG brand consideration reached an all-time high in the third quarter. UGG is increasingly seeing this segment of consumers adopt versatile slipper hybrids like the Tasman and Classic slip-on as consumers continue broadening the wearing occasions of iconic styles. Beyond these hybrids, male consumers gravitated towards heritage winter boots such as the Butte as well as weatherized versions of iconic styles like the Neumel.\nBrand heat remains at an all-time high based on the exciting new products designed for the brand's target audience. Supplementing these fantastic in-line products, our teams develop each season, UGG continues to build fashion credibility through collaborations. The most recent of which was with Designer Shayne Oliver, the founder of Hood by Air. Shayne's futuristic take on UGG Classics was covered by several high-profile outlets, including Vogue, Complex and Hypebeast. These aspirational styles continue to drive excitement in the line and bring awareness to a new audience of consumers.\nFrom an international standpoint, UGG showed growth on a constant currency basis despite revenue being down versus last year on a reported basis. This was led by DTC, as acquired and retained consumers in the channel each grew 38% versus the prior year. International wholesale was down versus last year as UGG lapped the supply chain disruption, which pushed additional shipments into the prior year's third quarter. Strength in the UGG brand's international regions is largely attributed to the successful ongoing marketplace reset activities completed over the last few years, which included a revamped approach to product and marketing helping drive greater synergies and product adoption across the globe.\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of UGG this fall. The brand continues to attract new consumers and drive more business through direct-to-consumer with the loyalty program that now has amassed over 7 million members worldwide. We feel great about the brand's ability to offset more normalized promotional activity through a strategic shift in channel mix, which also helped to reduce marketplace inventories heading into the spring 2023 season. We expect UGG to finish the fiscal year in a position of strength as demand for the brand's compelling products that are resonating with consumers globally has never been stronger.\nShifting to HOKA. Global revenue for the third quarter was $352 million, representing an increase of 91% versus last year on a reported basis. Another quarterly revenue record for HOKA. Just 2 quarters ago, we celebrated HOKA achieving $1 billion of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. And with the quarter just delivered, the brand has now eclipsed $1 billion of revenue over the last 9 months ended December 2022.\nHOKA growth in the third quarter was driven by share gains with run specialty accounts in the wholesale channel as product flow improved this year relative to last, allowing HOKA to increase sell-through. Added points of distribution with select strategic accounts as the brand has been slowly expanding throughout the year. Global DTC revenue more than doubling versus last year as consumer acquisition and retention increased 95% and 109%, respectively, and a favorable comparable period as wholesale shipments were disrupted in the prior year due primarily to port congestion.\nWe believe the FLY HUMAN FLY marketing campaign has been a key catalyst for the HOKA brand's DTC strength throughout the year, which has driven a higher growth rate than wholesale in each quarter thus far this fiscal year. During the third quarter, targeted marketing activations in Chicago and New York City helped drive a 22% increase in brand awareness, a 27% increase in consideration and a 33% increase on purchase intent in these markets over the next 6 months. We also believe these markets have seen a halo effect from the additional brand visibility created by pop-up stores, which have continued to perform well for HOKA.\nIn particular, we saw significant gains among 18 to 34-year-old consumers, who in the U.S. and EMEA drove the largest year-over-year increase of any age group during the third quarter. We have been increasingly encouraged by the broad product adoption from females in this coveted demographic, who appear to be actively searching hoka.com for what is new and exciting on a regular basis. Giving us confidence in the investments we are making to build brand awareness globally.\nThe all-new Solimar cross trainer is a perfect example of this trend. The Solimar launched earlier this fall without significant marketing dedicated to the shoe, but still landed in the top 5 styles purchased by females aged 18 to 34 years old in this quarter. HOKA is also resonating well with males in this demographic, but we see a great deal of more opportunity to further expose the brand's product depth by testing access points that specialize in serving this target consumer.\nImportantly, even with the expansion beyond run specialty distribution, the brand is hyper-focused on delivering in that core channel as well. According to aggregated U.S. run specialty store data, during December, HOKA increased market share by 5 percentage points versus last year, delivered the highest average product turns and maintain a gross margin well above the channel average.\nIn terms of our wholesale partner access points in the third quarter, we are extremely proud of the HOKA brand's performance as they continue to build market share in a highly competitive marketplace. With the strength of consumer demand for the brand, HOKA was able to maintain its high percentage of full-price business even with the incremental access points with strategic accounts. Though early days in some of the brand's new doors, the feedback on HOKA performance has been exceptional.\nOn the product side, HOKA has continued to introduce award-winning footwear. In October, HOKA was featured in the 2022 Men's Health Sneaker Awards with the Bondi 8 being chosen for the most comfortable cushion and the Kaha 2 GORE-TEX noted as the best hiking sneaker boot. In addition, Outside Magazine published its winter gear guide for 2023, selecting the Mafate Speed 4 as the best shoe for fast and rugged trail runs. l of us at Deckers are excited for what is to come for the HOKA brand, starting with a couple of innovative product launches planned for the fourth quarter and more to come in fiscal year 2024 and beyond.\nIn terms of consolidated channel performance in the third quarter, we saw strong growth in both global DTC and wholesale, but the majority of revenue growth was driven by global DTC, which increased 19% versus last year on a reported basis and 22% on a DTC comparable basis. DTC strength was driven by impressive global consumer acquisition and retention across the entire portfolio, which increased 44% and 38%, respectively.\nFrom a dollar growth perspective, global HOKA DTC volume more than doubled and UGG DTC increased 8% on a reported basis versus the prior year, driving over $100 million of combined incremental revenue.\nOn the wholesale side, consolidated global revenue increased 8% on a reported basis versus last year. Growth was driven by HOKA brand market share gains in existing points of distribution as well as incremental business from added doors with select strategic accounts. For the total portfolio, the increased HOKA volume was partially offset by lower wholesale shipments for UGG, where the brand focused on selling through existing inventory to reduce the need for promotional activity.\nEvidencing this success and illustrating the underlying brand heat during the season, UGG wholesale unit sell-through in the U.S. increased mid-single digits in fall '22 as compared to fall 2021. With the exceptional demand our brands were able to capture through DTC, combined with the strategic actions taken on the UGG wholesale front, our third quarter DTC mix increased from 50% last year to 52% this year.\nIn the third quarter, our brands achieved the highest DTC mix ever for our historically largest quarter, which represents great progress towards our long-term objective of a 50% mix of DTC business for the entire fiscal year across the portfolio. Alongside our disciplined omnichannel approach, I would like to shout out our amazing design teams that continually bring compelling new products to market. The combination of these talented teams creates the exceptional experience with our products that consumers have come to love and expect from our brands.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide further details on the third quarter performance and an update on our fiscal year 2023 guidance.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Adding to Dave's remarks, I would like to express how encouraged we are with the performance of our brands as we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment. We are fortunate that our 2 largest brands are very healthy, in proving resilient in a highly competitive marketplace due primarily to their differentiated and compelling product offering. While HOKA continues to drive incredible growth, as again shown this quarter, UGG was able to deliver relatively flat reported revenue as compared to last year's record revenue in a much more difficult consumer and macroeconomic environment that included a significant foreign exchange rate impact. In constant currency, the UGG brand delivered growth of low single digits in the quarter.\nOur organization's continued commitment to long-term strategic decision-making and disciplined approach to spending in an unchartered environment, propelled Deckers to yet another record quarter.\nNow let's get to the specifics of the third quarter financial performance. Third quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $1.346 billion, representing an increase of 13% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 17.5% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued expansion of HOKA, which more than doubled its global DTC business through impressive increases in consumer acquisition and online retention and increased wholesale revenue by 83% versus last year due to market share gains and select increased points of distribution with strategic partners. HOKA also benefited from an easier comparison to last year's third quarter when wholesale shipments were disrupted by inventory delays that resulted from port congestion.\nGross margin for the third quarter was 53%, which is up 70 basis points from last year's 52.3%. The most material drivers of gross margin in the quarter were a significant benefit from reduced freight costs, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the prior year period. Additional gross margin impacts in the quarter included benefits from favorable channel mix with DTC growing faster than wholesale, favorable brand mix as the sales of our HOKA brand increased and price increases implemented at the end of last year. These were partially offset from more normalized promotions and closeout activity for UGG relative to minimal discounting last year.\nSG&A dollar spend in the third quarter was $350 million, up 7% versus last year's $328 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 160 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to benefits in the quarter from foreign currency remeasurement, but it still remains a headwind in the fiscal year to date through December and a lower ratio of marketing to sales as we shifted the timing of HOKA campaign spend into the fourth quarter to align with the launch of spring 2023.\nOur tax rate was 23.7%, which is higher than last year's 20.5%, primarily due to jurisdictional mix of business. These results, combined with favorable interest income relative to last year and a lower share count drove earnings per share to $10.48 which is more than $2 and 24% higher than last year's $8.42 per share.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2022, we ended this fiscal third quarter with $1.058 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $723 million, up 31% versus the same point in time last year, primarily to support the continued growth of the HOKA brand, which was light on inventory in the prior year due to factory delays with some offset from UGG inventory being down year-over-year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings.\nDuring the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $45 million worth of shares at an average price of $350.25. As of December 31, 2022, the company had approximately $1.46 billion of remaining authorized for share repurchases.\nNow moving to our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2023. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to be up 11% to 12% from our previous range of up 10% to 11%. This increase now equates to a full year revenue range of $3.5 to $3.53 billion. This is being driven by HOKA upside as the brand continues to exceed expectations in DTC and build market share across global wholesale access points.\nReflecting this update HOKA growth is now expected to increase in the low 50% range for the fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. Implying more than $450 million of incremental revenue versus last year.\nThe HOKA brands increased fiscal year revenue guide now implies a second half growth rate in the high 40% to low 50% range, with total dollar volume that is slightly greater than the first half. Reflecting the brand's balanced revenue across the year. Due to last year's supply chain disruption that impacted quarterly wholesale revenue timing, the HOKA brand's growth rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the brand's typical run rate. With that said, we expect to see continued robust DTC demand from consumers, driving strong growth in that channel.\nUGG revenue is still expected to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis. Implying a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter as the brand laps abnormal events in the prior year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, UGG had late arriving fall inventory, which wholesale customers would historically cancel, but instead kept their orders, preferring to procure inventory on the earlier side for the future seasons. This resulted in additional growth in the prior year fourth quarter that is not expected to be repeated. Additionally, UGG DTC benefited from backorder product that shipped in January last year.\nFurther, of all our brands, UGG is the most globally exposed brand, and as a result, continues to face the most significant headwinds from an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as compared to last year. Beyond our increased revenue outlook for full fiscal year 2023, gross margin is still expected to be approximately 50.5% and SG&A as a percentage of sales is still expected to be approximately 33%. Operating margin is still expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. Our effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%, and our increased diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $18 to $18.50.\nAs a reminder, due to the disruptive nature of how the second half of last year played out, the company pushed hard to improve the availability of our products earlier this year, and that strategy has served us well. And due to this push, more products shipped earlier this year and that, combined with currency headwinds have placed pressure on the reported percentage growth in the fourth quarter. With that said, we believe viewing our increased expectation for the full fiscal year more holistically is a better measure of the progress our brands are making.\nIn this context, we are delivering on what we said and have continued to increase our full fiscal year outlook despite a harsher impact from foreign currency fluctuations as compared to initial expectations at the outset of this year. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages inflationary pressure, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and geopolitical tensions.\nAs we approach the end of our fiscal year, I wanted to provide further context around the state of our business. On logistics, the level of disruption, delays and corresponding freight costs relative to the same point in time last year has continued to improve, though they remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. While the ongoing outbreak in China is not currently impacting footwear production or transit times in a material way, we are experiencing some minimal operational hurdles, and we'll continue to watch this situation closely.\nIn terms of inventory, we have continued to see improvement in the ratio of inventory growth to sales growth over the last few quarters, as was signaled in our expectation throughout this year. While still working to optimize levels, we feel good about our current inventory position, which is up over last year to satisfy increased HOKA demand. We still anticipate unique year-over-year comparisons based on disruption in the supply chain as well as the dynamics of the HOKA brand's increasing mix of both revenue and inventory, especially as it's more even quarterly revenue cadence compared to UGG.\nRegarding promotional activity. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, the marketplace has become increasingly influenced by higher levels of markdown activity. While our brands have maintained a high percentage of full-price business there has been a return to more normalized levels of promotion experienced prior to the pandemic, particularly with the UGG brand. HOKA has largely avoided additional discounting beyond the historical model update flow.\nGiven the dynamics of the marketplace, which is dealing with higher channel inventory, we are well positioned having managed inventory into the wholesale channel while leveraging our DTC capabilities, selling earlier and at higher margins, gaining share and, exceeding our original expectations on the year.\nOn currency, we have continued to experience impacts on our results from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting an approximate impact of $20 million to revenue and our expected headwind for the full fiscal year 2023 remains at approximately $100 million.\nFinally, as we finish out our fiscal year 2023 and look to deliver another exceptional year, we are also reflecting on the actions we took to manage our expense base and the trade-offs made to deliver these results. While we are not yet providing guidance for fiscal year 2024 and as our business expands, we will continue to review and invest in those areas that will drive the organization forward, especially as we start to see gross margin expansion. In this highly competitive environment, those further investments will support talent, innovation, technology and enterprise infrastructure, which are all critical to our continued success.\nThanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. We are proud of our strong results and ability to navigate a challenged consumer landscape through our marketplace management strategies tailored to each of our unique brands. Exiting the holiday season, we are encouraged by and have great confidence in the strength of our brands and the exciting future ahead. With the brand heat we're seeing on HOKA and UGG in particular, we feel Deckers is well positioned. Both brands operate on a pull model, and we believe the strong relationships our brands have built with key wholesale partners will serve us well.\nDecker's strategic brand marketplace management, omnichannel capabilities and flexible operating model continue to be the driving forces behind our company's sustained success. But Decker's success is ultimately made possible by the hard-working employees who go above and beyond to deliver consistent results aligned with our long-term strategic goals.\nThank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today, and thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to sharing more as we continue to build towards Decker's exciting future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to be here with you today to discuss the strong results delivered by our portfolio of compelling brands as we make continued strides towards our long-term strategic vision even amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment.\nFor the second quarter, revenue increased 21% versus prior year to $876 million. In the quarter, our 2 largest brands, UGG and HOKA drove compelling revenue growth of 6% and 58%, respectively. Steve will provide further details on the strength of our second quarter later in the call. But for now, I'd like to focus on how our first half results demonstrate Decker's progress towards longer-term goals.\nAs a reminder, our long-term vision is to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive international markets through strategic investments while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability for the company overall.\nWith the continued focus on moving our in-demand products into the marketplace early ahead of the UGG brand's peak selling season, and while at the same time, fueling year-round demand for the HOKA brand, we are pleased with the progress we have made thus far against our annual outlook of the current fiscal year. As we continue to track our progress, I reflect on the first half results of fiscal 2023, which thus far have delivered consolidated revenue growth of 21% versus last year and 64% versus 2 years ago, HOKA revenue growth of 57% versus last year, with the brand now representing 44% of consolidated revenue, up from 35% last year and 28% 2 years ago.\nUGG revenue growth of 3% versus last year, with international driving growth aligned with our strategy despite currency headwinds and a 63% increase in DTC acquisition versus last year for HOKA and a 54% increase for UGG reflecting the strength of the demand of our brands, which propelled revenue growth of 26% for the first half.\nResults like this demonstrate the success of Decker's multipronged approach to creating growth and proactively managing our brands to progress towards our long-term vision while delivering quality profitability. Deckers is able to deliver on our objectives while managing through external factors because of our flexible operating model, omnichannel capabilities and our nimble organization.\nOur compelling brands are well positioned for the second half of the fiscal year, and I'm confident in the team's ability to continue executing. Steve will provide further details on our updated thoughts on guidance and the macroeconomic environment later in the call.\nBut for now, let's dive into the brand and channel performance highlights for the second quarter and first half. Starting with UGG. As a reminder, Anne Spangenberg joined our company earlier this year to lead the Fashion Lifestyle group, which includes the UGG and Koolaburra brands. With her wealth of experience, Anne is already having an impressive impact on UGG, as a leader with passion and a clear vision that puts the consumer at the center of everything the brand is doing, it aligned with the UGG brand strategy implemented over the last few years and is focused on refining a few key elements of the brand's approach to product and demand creation, which include expanding the base of UGG consumers through a clear strategic vision of brand purpose and experience, prioritizing the design DNA of UGG in the product proposition, editing and focusing UGG products and experiences to maximize consumer impact and elevating the pinnacle expression of UGG. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Anne's vision integrated into the UGG brand's bright future ahead.\nMoving to UGG brands first half results. Global revenue in the second quarter increased 6% versus last year to $477 million. For the first half, UGG revenue increased 3% over the prior year. We've been talking for some time about the diversification of UGG product and the brand's focus on developing franchises to complement core Classics. The UGG product team has done a fantastic job broadening the consumer appeal beyond Classics, while also ensuring Classics remain the pinnacle expression of UGG. Keeping Classics special essential to our UGG marketplace allocation and segmentation strategy that spans multiple countries and critical to UGG maintaining high levels of brand interest around the world.\nFrom a product standpoint, UGG has quite literally elevated core Classics through the introduction of fashion-forward platform versions of the brand's most iconic styles, generating tremendous press coverage from being spotted on top models and going viral on TikTok. Platform Classics are already trending in the top 10 amongst new consumers in 18- to 34-year olds, and the fall season is just getting started.\nAdditionally, with excitement building around the platforms, we've also seen a significant demand uptick in the original core Classics that inspired them, as DTC revenue from the Classics Ultra Mini and the Classic Mini in the first half increased more than 200% and more than 60% versus last year, respectively.\nBeyond Classics, UGG has continued to find success with hybrid styles, of which the latest and greatest example has been the Tasman. For the first half of this year, the Tasman has been a top 5 style for UGG overall and the #1 style purchase at DDC. We've been encouraged to see the Tasman being adopted as a genderless style, a movement being led by the UGG brand's 18- to 34-year-old cohort as the second most popular and most popular style among female and male consumers in the age group, respectively.\nFurther to the Tasman's popularity and the prevalence of platforms, UGG introduced a platform Tazz last year, and the style is already in the top 10 amongst 18- to 34-year olds. We're excited about the continued opportunity with this franchise as it speaks to the UGG brand's growing year on appeal and increased category diversification.\nDriving the success of an early attention to UGG this fall, with the brand team's enhanced global marketing campaign strategy that leans into the consumer feedback derived from a recent brand survey. With concrete consumer feedback across the 8 global markets provided by the surveys, UGG designed this year's campaign dubbed Feels Like UGG, to deliver a unified brand message via local influencers that were cast specifically for each of these individual key markets, which leans into the feeling and comfort that are core to the brand's DNA.\nBeginning with an influencer event in Paris that coincided with the UGG collaboration with opening ceremony and continuing on to a collaboration with 6PM that was featured during Fashion Week Milan, the Feels Like UGG campaign was launched on the runway and broadcast globally through social engagement by a community of ambassadors and consumers who love the brand.\nWe are seeing tremendous response from consumers thus far, as in the second quarter, search interest for the U.S. increased 11% versus last year, with 2/3 of the UGG.com visitors new to the site, 18- to 34-year-old site visitors in EMEA more than doubled versus last year, Asia Pacific DTC business grew 11% versus last year and global DTC retention increased 50% versus the prior year.\nThe consumer response has been positive globally for the UGG brand. First half revenue was driven by international regions as the U.S. lap significant wholesale refill activity from the prior year. Additionally, some of this year-to-date growth overseas is due to lapping supply chain latency in the first half of last year, but we feel the UGG brand's international regions returning to growth is proof of the successful marketplace reset initiatives implemented over the last few years.\nAll in all, the UGG brand is positioned well for holiday with inventory availability having improved relative to last year in key markets across the globe. We're encouraged by the results we've seen early in the season, but as always, remain cautious with our busiest period still to come.\nShifting to HOKA, global revenue for the second quarter increased 58% versus last year for $333 million, a quarterly revenue record for HOKA, leading to a first half revenue increase of 57% versus last year. HOKA growth continues to be driven by the brand's exceptional global ecosystem of access points, which is building market share through increased awareness and benefiting from strategic door count increases. While greater market share with existing accounts is responsible for the majority of HOKA growth this year, the brand has made some notable addition to access points, which include expanded distribution with strategic growth accounts, 12 owned and operated stores to build awareness and serve the monobrand China market, 2 stores in Japan and 5 pop-up stores in the U.S. Each of these access points are designed to build HOKA brand awareness and increase consumer access to new geographic locations.\nIn addition, the HOKA brand has rolled out exciting out-of-home FLY HUMAN FLY campaign content in highly visible cities around the world, helping to drive a 145% increase in search terms in New York and Los Angeles. With these efforts, we've seen the HOKA brand's DTC growth rate accelerate from the first quarter into the second.\nOverall, for the first half, HOKA has driven exceptional increases in DTC retention and acquisition, increasing 70% and 63%, respectively, across global markets. All of these actions are driving incredible increases in brand awareness. Over the last 2 years, HOKA awareness across all consumers has improved 9 percentage points and even crossed the 20% threshold, with awareness among runners even higher.\nAccording to Decker's proprietary brands tracker study, outside of the U.S., awareness is much lower, with most regions sitting in the low teens percentage, but seeing similarly explosive growth and awareness, which highlights the significant opportunity for continued HOKA brand expansion. Augmenting the global marketing campaign, HOKA global event sponsorships have continued to help the brand maintain and build performance credibility with extreme athletes around the world.\nOne recent example of this is the HOKA brand sponsorship of the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, the UTMB World Series. In the brand's first year sponsoring the UTMB Series, we saw positive results, as HOKA achieved a 34% share of shoes tracked on race participants, which is well above last year's total.\nAdditionally, HOKA athlete, Ludovic Pommeret placed first in 145-kilometer TDS race that Chamonix in this year's UTMB series wearing the HOKA Speedgoat trail shoe to conquer the course's diverse terrain. The HOKA brands alignment with the ultra competitive UTMB series highlights the brand's focus on becoming a leader in the growing outdoor trail and hiking segment.\nThe aforementioned Speedgoat is the HOKA brand's top trail shoe. Coinciding with the UTMB event, in order to complement the Speedgoat, HOKA launched the Mafate Speed 4, which is an innovative update to a heritage style designed to broaden the brand's footprint in trail. Early reads from consumers purchasing the Mafate have been exceptionally strong across global markets, which is exciting for HOKA as the brand focuses on building market share in the trail category.\nFor hiking, HOKA now has 2 franchises in the Kaha and the Anacapa that are experiencing immense growth and building market share. Thus far, in fiscal year 2023, both of these hiking franchises have made their way into the top 10 most purchased styles for HOKA. We believe this is because of the unique HOKA DNA that sets these franchises apart with their lightweight platform and maximum cushion that compares favorably to bulkier products from the competition.\nImportantly, while we're seeing really strong growth in new categories of focus such as trail and hiking, HOKA is also delivering exceptional growth and results with core running styles like the Bondi. With the support of the increased global brand awareness I mentioned earlier, the brand's launch of the eighth evolution of the flagship Bondi franchise was even more impactful as the Bondi 8 was the top-selling style globally in the second quarter, more than doubled last year's Bondi 7 volume among 18- to 34-year-old consumers. It was a top 5 DTC style across Decker's entire portfolio of brands for the first half despite just launching in August.\nWith this latest addition, Bondi, the brand's most plush ride got softer and more comfortable. With the lightest HOKA foam to date in an all-new extended shell geometry, featuring rear crash pads that provide a soft and balanced transition built for long distance. In just a few months of selling, the Bondi 8 has already been named the Best Road Running Shoe by both the SALT Certified Sneaker Awards as well as the GQ Fitness Awards. Congratulations to the HOKA team for the continued success and balanced growth across global regions and product categories. We look forward to delivering more exciting and innovative products throughout the rest of this fiscal year and beyond.\nFrom a channel performance perspective, the first half was strong in both wholesale and DTC, fueled by a 39% increase in consumer acquisition and 44% increase in retention. First half global direct-to-consumer revenue grew 26% versus last year. HOKA continues to be a significant driver of consolidated DTC growth, and the brand's growth rate even accelerated from the first quarter into the second, overall increasing 66% versus the prior year for the first half.\nUGG also contributed to the first half DTC growth, as the brand returned to growth in Q2, leading to a 4% increase for the brand in the first half. On wholesale, global revenue in the first half increased 20% versus last year. Strength in the wholesale channel was primarily driven by HOKA gaining global market share and the brand benefiting from select additional doors with strategic accounts. UGG also contributed to first half wholesale growth in the brand's international regions.\nOur first half performance highlights the strength of our omnichannel marketplace management strategies that have allowed our brands to build market share with strategic retailers, while capturing DTC demand at the same time. And while we continue to see great demand in the marketplace for our brands, as we move into the back half, the environment is evolving quickly, which may present challenges outside of our control. However, our teams are focused on the variables that are within our control as we work towards this year's objectives.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve, who will walk you through further details on second quarter performance, as well as the context of our reaffirmed full year top and bottom line guidance.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered strong results in the second quarter to finish the first half of fiscal year 2023 in a position of strength. HOKA drove another quarter of exceptional growth, and UGG continues to elevate its presence globally. While there is plenty of heavy lifting ahead and we are now operating in our historically largest and most complex fiscal quarter, I'm confident in our team's demonstrated ability to execute on our plans even as macroeconomic challenges persist, most notably the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We will lean on our omnichannel capabilities, flexible operating model and strong balance sheet to remain nimble in navigating any dynamic marketplace shifts that may occur as we provide our brands the opportunity to continue building long-term sustainable market share.\nNow let's get into the details of the second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $876 million, representing an increase of 21% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 25% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the expansion of HOKA, which increased 58% versus last year, delivering record quarterly revenue of $333 million, and a 20% reported increase in UGG international regions as the brand benefited from marketplace reset initiatives implemented over the past couple of years, as well as lapping disrupted wholesale shipments in the prior year.\nGross margin for the second quarter was 48.2%, which is down 270 basis points from last year's 50.9%. Roughly half of the decline in gross margin was driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, with additional impacts from higher promotional activity for UGG as compared to last year's exceptionally low levels with the brand primarily utilizing higher-margin DTC closet events to move through excess spring season inventory. Higher ocean freight rates, which was partially offset by benefits from a reduction in airfreight usage, HOKA price increases and favorable brand mix with HOKA driving the majority of growth.\nSG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was $294 million, up 23% versus last year's $239 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 50 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to higher advertising spend as a percentage of revenue. Our tax rate was 21.2%, which compares to 20.1% for the prior year. These results culminated in a diluted earnings per share of $3.80 for the quarter, which is $0.14 above last year's $3.66 diluted earnings per share.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At September 30, 2022, we ended September with $419 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $925 million, up 45% versus the same point in time last year, primarily from HOKA brand as we bring product in to continue momentum with the brand. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million worth of shares at an average price of $290. As of September 30, 2022, the company had approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases.\nNow moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2023. We are reaffirming prior consolidated revenue, operating margin and diluted earnings per share guidance. Our full fiscal year 2023 guidance now includes reaffirmed reported revenue growth of 10% to 11%, anticipating between $3.45 billion and $3.5 billion. With HOKA now expected to increase up to 50% versus last year, helping to offset larger currency headwinds as a result of a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And UGG is expected to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis, primarily due to negative currency impacts.\nGross margin now expected to be approximately 50.5%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance, primarily due to increased currency impacts, as well as some additional promotional activity. SG&A as a percentage of sales now expected to be approximately 33%, reflecting variable savings to help offset further gross margin pressure that we have now incorporated.\nOperating margin range is still expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. Tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% and diluted earnings per share is reaffirmed in the range of $17.50 to $18.35.\nPlease note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruption, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changing consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and geopolitical tensions.\nNow for some additional context on the state of our business as we approach the busiest part of our year. From a logistics standpoint, we are still experiencing delays and the timing of container arrivals remains difficult to predict. But we feel good about the improvement in transit times, which has led to a reduction of inventory in transit on both a dollar and percentage basis as compared to last year.\nAdditionally, I am pleased to report that container costs have come down, but would caution that we won't start to see that improvement in our gross margin for a few quarters. With that said, the headwinds we have experienced from ocean freight in the first half are expected to turn neutral for the remainder of this fiscal year.\nWith the improvement we've seen on transit times and our strategic prioritization to bring inventory in earlier and hold higher levels in the country of sale, we no longer expect to use a material level of air freight in this fiscal year. Additionally, with the strength of our brands and ability to move through some promotional inventory during the quarter, we have seen our year-over-year inventory growth rate moderate as compared to recent quarters, with inventory levels 45% higher as of September 30 compared to the same date last year, at which point, inventory levels were below normal operating levels.\nWhile we are still chasing the exceptional demand for our brands, particularly with the opportunity we've outlined for HOKA, we are likely to see inventory growth outpace sales in part to hedge against future disruption. On the promotional environment, given how clean we have been over the last few years, with very little promotion across our portfolio of brands, we have experienced increased levels of promotion so far this year related to clearing some excess inventory, largely UGG spring season product and shifts in the macroeconomic environment. Embedded in our updated guidance for the full year, we expect more promotional activity relative to the exceptionally low level of promotion in prior years.\nFurther on gross margin, I'd like to touch on currency as this has increasingly been a topic of interest. For the first half, we have seen a currency revenue impact to the tune of approximately $30 million and a 110 basis point impact to gross margin. With our business being second half weighted and no signs of a weakening dollar, we are anticipating a second half revenue impact of approximately $70 million, primarily impacting the UGG brand. In total, we now expect currency to negatively impact our gross margin rate by approximately 140 basis points for the full fiscal year 2023. This increased currency headwind is the primary driver of our change in our updated gross margin outlook.\nAs our top and bottom line guidance has been maintained, despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar being incorporated, we are reflecting an underlying operational raise from our variable levers to remain on track with our original full year outlook. Excluding the negative impact of currency now projected in fiscal 2023, our guidance would indicate gross and operating margin expansion in comparison to the prior fiscal year. This currency-neutral margin expansion would be driven by reduced airfreight usage, competitive marketplace price increases and brand mix benefits with the growth of HOKA being partially offset by first half ocean freight pressures, as well as increased promotional activity.\nThough clearly, there is much to overcome for the balance of our fiscal year, I am confident in the strength of our brands and ability to leverage our flexible operating model to deliver the compelling guidance we set out at the outset of this fiscal year.\nThanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. We are excited about the strong results delivered in the first half of fiscal year 2023. But again, it's important to acknowledge that we are still operating within an uncertain environment where things can change quickly, and the bulk of our fiscal year is still ahead. With that said, Deckers is fortunate to have 2 of the strongest brands in the footwear space that continue to engage and attract new consumers every day.\nThe UGG brand's diverse product assortment is positioned well for holiday, led by elevated platform Classics, which are driving heat and excitement around the core, as well as the continued interest in more transitional hybrid styles like the Tasman and Ultra Mini. Paired with a compelling marketing campaign that is resonating across global markets, we expect UGG to perform well this holiday season.\nOur powerful brands, paired with strategic marketplace management, omnichannel capabilities and disciplined financial management, gives me the confidence that our organization can achieve a compelling guidance set forth for fiscal year 2023, even in the face of macro pressures that will impact the broader retail space. Of course, none of this will be possible without the dedication and the hard work of our employees, who I'd like to thank in advance of our busiest period of the year. I'd also encourage everyone listening to take a look at our FY '22 Corporate Responsibility Report that we'll be launching next week and will be posted on deckers.com, further highlighting our company's efforts to do good and do great in the communities where we operate and beyond.\nThanks, everybody, for joining us here today, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to continue sharing the exciting future ahead at Deckers.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to dive into another quarter of exceptional results, which represent a strong start to fiscal year 2023 and further progress towards our long-term strategies.\nFirst quarter revenue increased 22% versus last year to $614 million, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.66. Revenue growth was primarily driven by HOKA as the brand achieved its first ever $300 million quarter. With strong HOKA growth, we were able to deliver another profitable first quarter as we continue to reduce the historical seasonality of our portfolio through the expansion of year-round HOKA demand and further diversifying the UGG category mix.\nImportantly, our first quarter results demonstrated momentum behind our long-term vision: to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention, and drive international markets through strategic investments. We are making clear progress in each of these initiatives as during the first quarter, HOKA delivered global revenue of $330 million, an increase of 55% versus last year.\nUGG products mix shifted into sandals away from seasonal fall styles. UGG regional mix shifted towards international regions as these markets drove year-over-year revenue growth. Global DTC across all brands grew 15% as a result of increasing consumer acquisition and retention by 13% and 28%, respectively. And revenue from international markets increased 36% versus last year, which includes earlier distributor shipments.\nThese highlights reflect the strength of Decker's marketplace management and omnichannel capabilities across our portfolio of exciting brands. Our disciplined approach to managing brands, markets and distribution channels continues to serve us well as we create the future of Deckers. While the macroeconomic environment is evolving quickly, I'm confident in the consumer demand of our brands and our team's ability to remain nimble and deliver on our goals in this dynamic environment.\nSteve will provide further details around our forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, let's dive into the brand and channel performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nStarting with the brand highlights. Global HOKA revenue for the first quarter increased 55% versus last year to $330 million. This is a significant achievement that resulted in HOKA Global revenue in the trailing 12 months ended June 30, breaking the $1 billion barrier, which -- with much more growth ahead.\nThe HOKA brand's exceptional growth also delivered a new milestone for Deckers as a whole, with HOKA revenue representing more than 50% of total portfolio quarterly revenue for the first time. With its year on demand that utilizes infrastructure during off-peak UGG periods and full price selling at premium price points, the HOKA brand's growing scale is improving Decker's overall quarterly financial and operational performance.\nThe HOKA brand's strong quarter featured outstanding revenue growth across the brand's far-reaching global ecosystem of access points, highlighted by international markets increasing 66% versus last year, led by the strength of the EMEA region, which was partially influenced by the timing of sell-in for our distributors as we strategically build new markets.\nU.S. increasing 49% versus last year with DTC growth leading wholesale. Global DTC increasing 58% versus last year, driven by continued momentum with retained consumers as well as the continued acquisition of new consumers. And global wholesale increasing 53% versus last year as the brand increased market share at existing accounts and benefited from select doors added to strategic accounts.\nWe are excited by the positive brand indicators and continued share gains that HOKA is building upon across its entire global distribution network. A few highlights include: increasing market share within U.S. run specialty while commanding higher retail prices; focus styles accounting for at least half of the top 10 styles according to aggregated U.S.-run specialty store data; doubling revenue in France led by gains in Paris, which was our third fastest-growing European city during the quarter; and APAC driving the highest regional DTC growth rate, led by strength in both China and Japan as these countries benefited from stores aiding awareness with consumers.\nAcross the globe, HOKA stores have continued to build excitement with the new audience and drive compelling levels of traffic and purchase activity. This is especially exciting in China, which has been a slow build as HOKA took some time to find its voice with the consumers local to the region. With the refined visual merchandising strategy enhancing the consumer experience, our China stores are now driving higher conversion rates, and we're better equipped as we open additional locations in the region.\nIn the U.S., the retail team continues to work towards opening the HOKA brand's first permanent location in New York City during the spring of calendar year 2023. This is an exciting endeavor as the HOKA store will feature an elevated design that is fit for our premier performance brand. In the meantime, HOKA is opening a second New York City pop-up location near Lincoln Center within the next month.\nOur Chicago location, which was opened in the last 3 months, is seeing excellent traffic and driving strong conversion giving us even greater confidence in the consumer appetite for HOKA retail stores.\nWe will take a disciplined approach to opening a limited number of doors, but we're excited about the opportunity to engage with the consumers in key cities around the world. Further on direct-to-consumer across global markets, HOKA continues to increase the number of acquired and retained consumers at remarkable levels compared to the prior year.\nDuring the quarter, DTC acquisition increased 48% and retention increased 58% versus last year, with gains among 18- to 34-year-old consumers far outpacing these increases. This led to a 4 percentage point increase in the mix of 18- to 34-year olds among individuals purchasing from HOKA.com.\nWe are seeing incredible momentum behind HOKA as the brand continues to inspire humans to fly over the earth. The HOKA brand ethos is echoed through its new globally-integrated marketing campaign dubbed FLY HUMAN FLY. This campaign was thoughtfully designed as an invitation for humans around the world to experience the HOKA ride. As part of the campaign, HOKA launched the fifth edition of the Mach, which has quickly become a top 5 style for the brand, as well as a completely redesigned consumer website. The upgraded website features a brand-new aesthetic that elevates product presentation with greater technical detail and enhances the visibility of brand values and storytelling throughout the site.\nFLY HUMAN FLY has been live for just over a month now, and we have been very pleased with the consumer response and feedback from our wholesale partners. For the FLY HUMAN FLY landing page on HOKA.com, 83% of visitors were new, which aligns with the campaign's intent to reach a new audience. We believe this campaign will have a significant impact on building awareness of HOKA as we expand the brand into a multibillion dollar major player in the performance space over the long term.\nSpeaking of performance, I'd like to congratulate HOKA-sponsored athlete, Adam Peterman, for winning the 100-mile 2022 Western States race. This was an incredible feat for Adam, having this been his first time ever competing in a 100-mile race. He won while wearing the recently launched HOKA Speedgoat 5, which is a completely redesigned version of the brand's most popular trail shoe with less weight and enhanced traction with VIBRAM Megagrip to inspire confidence in any terrain.\nResults like these emphasize that HOKA brand's leadership is a premier performance brand, enabling athletes to achieve peak levels of performance. Another congratulations to Adam and all the other athletes who competed in this year's HOKA-sponsored Western States 100.\nMoving to UGG. Global revenue in the quarter decreased 2% versus last year to $208 million. UGG performance was driven by higher international wholesale and distributor sell-in that was offset by category shift dynamics impacting the brand's global direct-to-consumer business. The UGG brand's international regions continue to experience benefits from the marketplace allocation and segmentation strategies implemented to build brand heat and increased demand overseas.\nWith core fall product limited in the marketplace, UGG was able to drive full price sell-through during the past holiday season and generate open-to-buy opportunities in the spring season, driving the quarter's results. UGG captured incremental market share with transition styles such as the Ultra MINI and Coquette, as well as the newly launched Sport Yeah sandal, all of which are driving sell-through.\nBriefly touching on the category dynamics impacting UGG global DTC. Over the last couple of years, the Fluff franchise experienced increased relevance as consumers turn to UGG for comfortable and stylish hybrid slippers to wear in the home. Expecting shifts in consumer behavior towards outdoor wearing, the UGG product team continued to evolve the franchise with the introduction of more spring, summer and outdoor-ready styles, which included the Sport Yeah sandal.\nSandals were a standout category for UGG during the quarter, showing the strong demand for the brand outside of the fall and winter time frame. While successful in shifting consumer adoption from heritage fluff franchise styles into beach-ready styles, the lower average selling price in the sandal category created a revenue headwind relative to the exceptional volumes of Fluff that were sold during Q1 in the last 2 years.\nThat said, the Fluff Yeah continues to be its top style among acquired and retained consumers including with 18- and 34-year-olds. Across our UGG global direct-to-consumer, even though revenue dollars are below last year due to these product mix shifts, demand for UGG remained robust as the brand experienced increases of 8% and 13% in acquired and retained consumers, respectively, versus the prior year.\nImportantly, international DTC acquisition and retention gains are trending well ahead of these global figures as we continue to build brand heat overseas. Key styles driving new consumer acquisition globally include the aforementioned Fluff Yeah and Sport Yeah, as well as the Clem and Goldenstar fashion sandals and the Tasman franchise, which continues to be on fire. We are encouraged by the continued consumer interest and broader adoption of the UGG brand's diverse product assortment.\nOverall, the first quarter represented a solid start to the year for UGG. We believe UGG is well positioned to drive a successful fiscal year 2023. And I'm even more excited for the brand's future after our recent announcement of Anne Spangenberg as the President of Fashion Lifestyle. Anne is a proven leader with meaningful experience building brands across our industry, most recently serving as Nike's Chief Merchant, and has already hit the ground running in the last few weeks as she begins to immerse herself with all things UGG and engage with our talented brand team and cross-functional business partners.\nIn her new role, Anne will be building upon the strategic priorities for UGG focusing on product diversification, consumer adoption and franchise evolution across our omnichannel marketplace. I'd like to welcome Anne and thank the UGG team for the cross-functional collaboration and teamwork that enabled the brand to maintain a strong positioning in the market as we work to fill this role.\nFrom a channel performance perspective, in the first quarter, Global Wholesale segment revenue, including distributors, was the primary driver of growth, increasing 25% versus last year. Strength in these channels resulted primarily from continued global market share gains for HOKA as well as the benefits from added doors with strategic accounts.\nUGG also contributed to wholesale revenue gains based on the continued adoption of the brand's diverse product assortment among international regions, which continue to benefit from marketplace reset activities.\nOn direct-to-consumer, global revenue for the first quarter increased 15% versus the prior year. DTC growth was driven by significant increases in consumer acquisition and retention for the HOKA brand, which was partially offset by the category and seasonal dynamics unique to the UGG brand that I covered earlier in the call.\nOverall, our direct-to-consumer business continues to benefit from the HOKA brand's growing influence especially in quarters outside of historical peak selling periods for UGG. In the quarter just completed, HOKA represented 53% of DTC revenue, which is up from 39% last year and 27% 2 years ago. With nearly all of the HOKA brand's DTC business occurring through e-commerce, our most profitable channel, this brand shift dynamic is accretive to our bottom line.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our reaffirmed outlook on fiscal year 2023.\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just shared, our first quarter results demonstrated great progress toward the fiscal year guidance that we outlined in May. While we advanced a number of key initiatives for our business this quarter, HOKA was the primary driver of performance as the brand continues to build global market share.\nUGG revenue came in slightly lower than last year, primarily due to category shifts occurring during the quarter as well as lapping earlier sell-in during the prior year. But we feel the brand is well positioned to deliver another strong year and are excited for what lies ahead under Anne's leadership.\nWith ongoing uncertainty and the macroecononic environment, we're continuing our disciplined and responsible approach to managing our business, and will remain Nimble to react to this dynamic environment. Our demand signals lead us to believe that our portfolio of brands will continue to resonate well with consumers. And though not immune to the macroeconomic headwinds, Deckers has historically demonstrated an ability to course correct when necessary.\nWe remain committed to our long-term strategies that have continued to serve us well and will build upon the strong operating model we have built over the last 5 years.\nNow let's get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2023 results. First quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $614 million, up 22% versus prior year. HOKA revenue increased 55% versus last year, accounting for nearly all of this quarter's revenue growth due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brand's global ecosystem of access points and improved inventory availability.\nFor the first time ever, HOKA represented more than 50% of total portfolio quarterly revenue. And over the last 12 months ended June 30, the brand has delivered over $1 billion of revenue.\nGross margins for the quarter was 48%, which is down 360 basis points from last year's 51.6%. This aligned with our first half direction that anticipated headwinds from higher freight costs from ocean and air as well as impacts from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that we anticipate will pressure margins for the remainder of this year.\nAdditionally, first quarter gross margin was impacted by product mix and normalized promotional activity for UGG as the brand sold more sandals and discounted select styles in line with pre-pandemic activity, and channel mix shifting toward the wholesale and distributor segment, in particular, our international distributor business that shipped product earlier than in years past.\nThese headwinds were partially offset from benefits from increased revenue mix of HOKA as the brand commanded the highest gross margin in the portfolio during Q1 and benefits from HOKA price increases. SG&A dollar spend in the first quarter was $238 million, which is up 20% from last year's $199 million. As a percentage of revenue, we delivered 60 basis points of leverage to help offset freight and FX impact to gross margin.\nOur tax rate was 21.3%, which compares to 21.9% in the prior year. These results drove diluted earnings per share of $1.66 for the quarter, which was $0.05 below last year's $1.71 per share.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2022, we ended June with $695 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $840 million, up 83% versus the same point in time last year, and important to note that last year's inventory levels were below normal operating levels as a result of supply chain disruption. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings.\nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares at an average share price of $260.12. As of June 30, 2022, the company had approximately $354 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $1.2 billion on top of the company's existing share repurchase authorization, which now, in total, represents more than 15% of our market capitalization, highlighting the Board's confidence in our long-term strategic plan.\nNow for supply chain update. Over the last several quarters, we've shared an update on the status of our logistics network and our continued mitigation efforts as we navigate macro supply chain disruption. We are pleased that there have been relative improvement in this area in Q1, but I will share some brief thoughts before I touch on our fiscal year 2023 outlook.\nTransit times have improved relative to last year, but we are still experiencing latency and lower visibility into the timing of inventory with nearly 40% in transit and thus are continuing to prioritize holding inventory in the country of sale. For example, during the first quarter, inventory generally arrived earlier than anticipated. As a result, we shipped more product out.\nHowever, with low visibility into when certain shipments will arrive, we are comfortable holding higher levels of inventory to enable our brands to meet the significant marketplace demand we are seeing. Though difficult to predict the timing of when inventory will land, we expect that heightened inventory levels will continue throughout this fiscal year.\nOn the cost front, we are confident that the price increases implemented in the HOKA and UGG brands will offset freight headwinds and help bolster second half margins to deliver our full fiscal year 2023 guidance. Given the earlier arrival of inventory, we now expect to use less airfreight than originally anticipated for the HOKA brand. However, as the dollar has continued to strengthen, we are anticipating greater currency headwinds and this reduction in planned airfreight should help offset these currency pressures.\nNow turning to our guidance. And with these dynamics in mind, we are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2023 guidance, which, as a reminder, includes: revenue growth of 10% to 11% versus last year; gross margin, 50 basis points higher than last year, anticipating approximately 51.5%; SG&A at approximately 34% of revenue; and operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%; a tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%; and with the share repurchase executed during the first quarter just completed, diluted earnings per share will now be expected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.35 reflecting a $0.10 increase.\nWhile we have maintained our overall guidance, I'd like to highlight a few additional items contemplated within the guidance, which include stronger HOKA revenue growth now expected to increase in the 40% range versus last year, reflecting upside from greater inventory availability, which aligns to our expectation of using less air freight than originally anticipated and incremental foreign currency headwinds primarily affecting UGG growth due to the brand's wholesale business model and concentration of planned growth from the international regions.\nThis reaffirmation of guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to: further impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses; labor shortages; inflationary pressures; changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures; further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and geopolitical tensions.\nWhile macroeconomic uncertainty persists, we believe in the power of our brands and continue to see positive signs of consumer demand. Deckers has a history of remaining nimble, displaying a unique ability to react as marketplace dynamics evolve and we are well positioned to deliver compelling revenue growth and top-tier operating margins.\nThanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. We are quite pleased with the start to fiscal year 2023 as our portfolio drove revenue growth above 20% in the first quarter, and our organization continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives.\nI want to congratulate the entire HOKA team and all of the shared service individuals that support the brand on reaching the $1 billion revenue milestone. This is a huge feat for HOKA, but also for Deckers as a whole, to have a second brand in our portfolio to reach this significant point of scale.\nThe exciting part for our company is that we believe HOKA has much more growth ahead as the brand stays laser-focused on its strategic expansion plan. The brand's FLY HUMAN FLY campaign is just the beginning of our journey to build awareness and broaden the consumer aperture for HOKA.\nFrom a talent perspective, we are fortunate to have bolstered our executive leadership team with the recent promotion of Angela Ogbechie to Chief Supply Chain Officer, and the hiring of Anne Spangenberg as President of Fashion Lifestyle. I'm excited to be working closely with both of these experienced leaders and look forward to their contributions that are sure to further enhance Decker's workplace culture and drive success against our long-term strategic initiatives. I'd also like to thank our executive leadership team and all of our employees for remaining flexible and staying focused on our goals while managing through transition.\nWith our strong portfolio of brands, dedicated employees and disciplined management of the business, I don't think I've ever been this excited for the opportunities ahead for Deckers. And I view the Board of Directors recently approved increase to our share repurchase authorization, which in total now represents more than 15% of Decker's current market capitalization as an impressive vote of confidence in our company, brands, people and strategic plan for the future of our organization. A big thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to share our record-breaking fiscal year 2022 results, which include a number of significant achievements. The first time Deckers delivered over $3 billion in annual revenue, and we did so just 3 years after reaching $2 billion. In total, we delivered fiscal 2022 revenue of $3.15 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior year and nearly 50% above 2 years ago. Aligned with our commitment to driving top line growth and healthy profitability, Deckers delivered an operating margin just shy of 18%. And lastly, we delivered earnings per share of $16.26, which represents a 21% and 69% increase over last year and 2 years ago, respectively.\nAs I reflect on this incredible expansion and evolution of our business over the past 2 years I look forward to seeing our brands build up this momentum, and I'm even more excited about the runway ahead. Of course, none of this will be possible without our dedicated employees and exceptional leadership team collaborating to deliver in a difficult supply chain environment while remaining focused on executing to the long term. Because of these efforts, our performance this year was well aligned with our long-term strategies to drive quality HOKA growth, further diversify and elevate the UGG brand, strengthen and build our DTC business and unlock the full potential of our international markets.\nMore specifically, our progress in these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2022 includes: growing HOKA revenue by 56% over the prior year to nearly $900 million, which represents 28% of the total portfolio revenue, up from 22% last year and 17% 2 years ago, diversifying UGG revenue and highlighting the brand's success around the core with categories outside of women's classics now representing more than 65% of annual brand revenue, up more than 10 percentage points from 5 years ago, increasing DTC revenue by 14% versus the prior year and 65% versus 2 years ago; and expanding our international business, which grew 25% versus last year and 34% versus 2 years ago.\nAgain, I'm proud of our organization for the hard work that enabled accomplishing these exceptional results while navigating an extremely complicated logistics environment. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we are operating from a position of strength and leveraging the lessons learned over the last 18 months. Deckers has incredible growth ahead, and I have the utmost confidence in the consumer demand for our brands and our team's proven ability to deliver on our goals, even amidst a complex macro environment. Steve will provide more details on our forward-looking expectations later in the call.\nIn the meantime, I will share some details about fiscal 2022 brand and channel performance as well as some context around strategies propelling us forward in fiscal 2023. Starting with the brand highlights. Global fiscal 2022 revenue increased to 15% versus last year to $1.982 billion. This is the second consecutive year of driving double-digit growth. Success in fiscal 2022 was driven by continued consumer adoption of the Brands' diverse product assortment as all major categories increased double digits over the prior year, men's footwear grew to over $300 million after adding approximately $100 million over the last 3 years, apparel and accessories combined increased 47% over last year, now representing more than 6% of brand mix at more than $100 million and women's Classics continue to drive incremental dollar growth through newness. Consumers adopting a broader assortment of UGG products is directly related to the brand's ability to develop new franchises while innovating existing franchises.\nThe Ultra Mini is a great example of the latter. First introduced in the second half of 2020 as a companion style related to the Brands' core Classic Media and Classic Short, the Ultra Mini has been viewed as something of a sneaker alternative with its greater year-round wearability as it supports a lower ankle height profile. While still very new to the ag assortment, the Ultra Mini has already become a top 5 DTC style among both newly acquired and retained consumers, and it was just outside of the top 5 styles among consumers aged 18 to 34 years old.\nThe Tasman is another bugstyle that younger consumers are wearing as a sneaker alternative. The original Tasman has been around for many years now, but the out product team has developed this heritage style into a burgeoning franchise through the infusion of fresh colors, new prints and logo treatments, adding new lightweight and sustainable material options such as our UGG Plush blend of upcycle roll and plant-based lycocell for the Tasman LTA; the introduction of the TAS, a fashion leading platform version; and most recently, the launch of an innovative rain clog, the Tasman X. We are particularly excited about the initial response of the Tasman X, which was featured as part of a broader rain campaign during the fourth quarter and received positive coverage in a number of fashion publications, including a few organic consumer unboxing viral videos on TikTok. With its versatility, year-round relevance and broad consumer appeal, we believe the Tasman franchise can continue to be a key driver of further diversifying and de-seasonalizing the UGG brand.\nFrom an omnichannel marketplace management perspective, the UGG brand strategic priorities for the year played out as expected, with domestic wholesale driving impressive growth through a diverse product assortment while refilling the channel inventories, international regions growth rate exceeding the U.S. growth rate for the first time in 4 years and global direct-to-consumer increasing mid-single digits on top of the more than 30% increase from the prior year. These results are a testament to UGG omnichannel marketplace management as the brand was able to drive strong growth across all channels despite logistics challenges impacting the timing of deliveries and availability of products.\nThis also speaks to the consumer demand for UGG overall, which remains quite high, as evidenced in the fourth quarter just completed. UGG outperformed well beyond our expectations in the fourth quarter as wholesalers accepted later-than-normal deliveries and DTC shoppers weighted beyond the peak holiday season for availability of key items that have been out of stock.\nAcross the full fiscal year 2022, we saw a number of favorable indicators for UGG demand, including: U.S. search interest increasing 9% over last year and 20% over 2 years ago, according to Google Trends, 18- to 34-year olds remaining the UGG brand's largest age bracket of consumers, incremental purchases of multiple products at the same time, led by Tasman, Neumel and slipper combinations, highlighting our UGG-for-all mantra and an increase in the brand's loyalty program enrollment across every region with nearly 6 million global members at year-end.\nAs the size and scale of the UGG rewards program continues to grow, I want to highlight a few key metrics that emphasize the value of these loyal consumers, such as that members account for approximately 40% or more of revenue in all regions where the program has existed for more than 1 year and that members spend approximately 40% to 50% more than nonloyalty consumers. Fiscal 2022 was another strong year for the UGG brand, and I'd like to thank the team for their hard work and dedication to delivering back-to-back years of exceptional growth.\nOn the heels of the growth delivered over the last 2 years, we are placing an emphasis on maintaining the record levels of brand heat across global markets. To do this, we expect to elevate the brands through disciplined and strategic global marketplace management prioritize the consumer experience at DTC to build loyalty, edit to amplify the assortment, driving fewer but more powerful product stories and attracting new consumers through innovative fashion collaborations. I'm proud of the great work the UGG team has delivered and look forward to continued progress towards our strategic goals in the upcoming year.\nMoving on to HOKA. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 increased 56% versus last year to $892 million, with improved supply, enabling the delivery of strong growth in the fourth quarter, HOKA drove yet another year of record-breaking results with plenty of exciting runway ahead. The HOKA team continues to build a balanced business across the brand an ecosystem of access points, which has enabled growth in every region across all channels.\nMore specifically, from a channel perspective, for the full year, HOKA Global Wholesale accelerated, increasing 55% versus the prior year, with volume that is now larger than the brand's entire business in fiscal 2021 and global direct-to-consumer increased 58% versus last year with strong gains in acquired and retained consumers. With the rapid growth and consumer adoption of HOKA, distribution management remains a critical component of driving awareness with and attracting new consumers.\nOn the wholesale front, I would note that the majority of growth in fiscal 2022 came from market share expansion with existing run specialty and outdoor retailers versus opening new points of distribution. While HOKA has opened new distribution with strategic partners and even expanded door counts with these accounts in certain instances, the brand continues to be highly disciplined about expansion.\nHOKA has a superb group of wholesale partners who have continued to support the brand's strategic vision, enhance the brand credibility and awareness with core consumers and help broaden the scope of consumers that HOKA reaches.\nFurther to that point, I'd like to provide a little more context around the HOKA brand's growth opportunity at wholesale in the upcoming year and beyond, which includes core to our brand strategy, building market share and run specialty. While in certain locations, HOKA has grown to the #1 or #2 brand, we have identified several regional growth opportunities within pockets of the U.S. as well as overseas. Volume expansion with strategic partners that have opened in the last 2 years with the opportunity to increase door counts over time and opening a select number of doors with new strategic accounts.\nOne of these new strategic relationships, I'd like to highlight is Foot Locker. HOKA and Foot Locker have shown mutual interest for several years now, and over that time, created a distribution plan that aligns the interest of both parties. We are excited to be opening HOKA in a limited number of Foot Locker doors beginning this summer, with the intent to increase the brand's exposure with the young consumers in key markets where HOKA is lacking presence with existing distribution.\nWe know from our experience with UGG that the Foot Locker team has a clear perspective on their consumer and believe this valuable partnership can have a considerable impact on HOKA awareness with the 18- to 34-year-old audience. Complementing the HOKA wholesale business, the brand's direct-to-consumer channel has continued to acquire new consumers as well as drive repeat purchases with existing consumers.\nIn fiscal 2022, HOKA global direct-to-consumer acquisition increased 50% versus the prior year, and retention increased 62% versus the prior year. While acquiring new consumers is an important metric as we expand HOKA awareness, increasing customer retention is a critical component of maintaining brand strength and building loyalty. Ultimately, DDC is where HOKA can best showcase the breadth and newness of the brand's innovative product assortment, including apparel, and provide a convenient consumer experience to drive repeat purchases.\nOver the last year, HOKA drove a more than 40% increase in the number of consumers making multiple purchases as well as those purchasing across multiple categories. Though wholesale remains the primary acquisition point for new consumers, the HOKA brand's digital marketing activations are also driving DDC acquisition with targeted consumers. The specific focus on the 18- to 34-year-old consumer the HOKA brand's digital tactics have been successful in growing the mix of these consumers by 2 percentage points over last year and 6 percentage points over 2 years ago.\nHOKA is also seeing a fantastic consumer response of the brand's pop-up retail locations. New York has been our strongest performer, but we're also excited about the recently opened pop-up store in Chicago and a relocation in Los Angeles, where we opened a store in Venice, California. We believe HOKA can deliver a premium experience at retail locations by showcasing the breadth of the brand's product offering and driving community engagement. Over the longer term, we see an opportunity to open a limited number of permanent locations in key cities around the world including our first U.S. location in New York City by the end of fiscal 2023.\nThe HOKA brand's new strategic wholesale distribution, targeted digital marketing activations and pop-up retail stores in key markets are collectively designed to accelerate consumer acquisition around the world through increased awareness. Our integrated approach to managing HOKA distribution continues to serve the brand well in driving balanced global growth across the HOKA ecosystem of access points.\nOn the product front, HOKA continues to develop an assortment designed to ignite the inter athlete within all humans. The brand's inclusive approach to product management includes evolving heritage franchises to be accessible to all types of athletes, elevating performance through new innovations and expanding the consumer audience through new categories. HOKA progress on all 3 of these strategies in fiscal '22 by introducing the Bondi X, which is both an evolution of the Heritage Bondi style and an elevation of performance with the addition of a propulsive carbon plate to the brand's most cushioned ride.\nTrail blazing with the all-new SpeakGoat 05, the lightest and most grippy version of the brand's #1 trail shoe, reinventing the Mach using a lower profile outsold that delivers soft cushion with an uptempo ride built for speed and capable of being a every day trainer, disrupting the height category with the AnaCappa franchise, which is a performance hunking shoe that features a sneaker like comfort and launching the all-new Kawana, which is designed to seamlessly transition from gym workouts to daily runs to casual wear.\nIn all, HOKA continues to develop a compelling product assortment that is built with all types of athletes in mind, serving the spectrum of performance fronters to extreme hikers and trail explorers as well as those looking for everyday all-day comfort.\nI want to congratulate the HOKA team on delivering another phenomenal year of growth, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2023 through continued market share gains with existing wholesale partners, expanded awareness with new consumers that the brand launches its first major global marketing campaign later this summer, driving acquisition and replenishment activity through our direct-to-consumer channel and introducing innovative products with the brand signature HOKA Rod.\nTurning to Teva. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 increased 17% versus last year to a record $163 million. Growth this year was driven by the brand's leadership in sports sandals and progress building share in closed-toe categories, highlighted by the success of the hurricane and the Rembert franchise. While wholesale drove the majority of growth for Teva in FY '22. The brand was able to comp the exceptional DTC growth experienced in the prior fiscal year. Success at DTC was driven by a significant increase in retained consumers, which the brand will look to replicate in the upcoming year. Shifting to Koolaburra.\nGlobal revenue in fiscal 2022 decreased 9% versus last year to $69 million due to the disruption of wholesale deliveries that resulted from pandemic-related bottlenecks. Despite this, the Koolaburra brand's D2C business increased 35% over last year and is now 3x the size of DTC volume 2 years ago. And finally, Sanuk Global revenue in fiscal year 2022 increased 3% to $43 million. We are pleased with the brand's performance driven by our greater mix of full-price business and an increase in higher price point items. With respect to channel performance in fiscal year 2022, both wholesale and DTC drove double-digit growth over the prior year, reflecting the strength of our omnichannel brand management.\nFor the year, global wholesale revenue increased 31% over last year and 39% over 2 years ago with 4 out of 5 brands posting double-digit increases this year. Wholesale dollar growth was primarily driven by the momentum of global HOKA as the brand continues to gain market share, refilling the marketplace inventories for domestic UGG accounts and the A-brands international markets returning to growth, benefiting from the marketplace reset activities over the past few years that cleaned up distribution in EMEA and localized product and marketing strategies in China.\nOverall, wholesale revenue represented 61% of total revenue, which is up from 58% last year, but down from 65% 2 years ago. We expect to drive continued growth through wholesale, working with best-in-class partners who are showcasing our brands and attracting new consumers around the world. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, revenue for the year increased 14% over last year and 65% over 2 years ago to $1.2 billion.\nWe experienced year-over-year gains in both physical retail as we lap closures during the prior year and online where we have focused our investments to drive new consumer acquisition and increase retention. Importantly, our DTC business is growing globally and across multiple brands as both domestic and international DDC increased double digits over last year, and 4 out of our 5 brands experienced growth on top of the exceptional increases achieved in the prior year with HOKA and OG accounting for the vast majority of dollar volume gains. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 financial results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2023. Steve?\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, our company's performance in fiscal year 2022 was outstanding as we drove top line growth above 20% and maintain top-tier operating margin in the high teens despite increased costs resulting from global supply chain disruption. Deckers has added just over $1 billion to revenue in 2 years, driven by the strength of demand for our brands, specifically HOKA, which has grown more than 50% for 3 consecutive years and UGG, which has increased double digits in back-to-back years.\nOur long-term strategies have continued to provide a strong foundation for driving profitable growth, and we are proud to maintain exceptional operating margin levels. We believe that with continued investment behind our key strategies, Deckers can drive profitable growth over the long term. We're excited about the year ahead, but first, let's get into our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $736 million, up 31% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by improved HOKA inventory availability that allowed the brand to deliver both record quarterly revenue of $283 million and full year revenue that was above the high end of our guidance range.\nBetter-than-expected outperformance as we saw an extension of the holiday season with consumers willing to wait for delayed DTC shipments of product and high demand and fewer wholesale cancellations due to the continued strength of the UGG brand as accounts showed a preference to hold greater levels of key seasonal inventory as a hedge against future potential supply chain disruption that could occur in the upcoming year. And as a result, we expect this to impact UGG orders in this coming fall. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 48.7%, a 450 basis point decrease from the prior year period.\nThe lower gross margin was primarily related to an approximate 490 basis point freight impact, primarily from increased air usage and higher ocean rates, unfavorable channel mix as wholesale growth outpaced DTC and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates with partial offsets from HOKA margins benefiting from price increases and favorable brand mix. SG&A for the quarter was $277 million or 37.7% of revenue versus last year's $244 million or 43.5% of revenue. The increased spend was primarily related to higher headcount, marketing and performance-related compensation. These results, along with the lower tax rate and share count, resulted in diluted earnings per share, more than doubling last year's at $2.51. Our fourth quarter results underscore the exceptional performance demonstrated by our brands throughout fiscal year 2022, where Deckers eclipsed $3 billion of revenue for the first time. For the full fiscal year 2022, revenue increased 24% versus last year to $3.15 billion. Our company added over $1 billion in top line revenue over the last 2 years, delivering a nearly 50% increase over fiscal year 2020.\nAs compared to our guidance, revenue was $90 million above the high end, primarily due to outperformance in UGG. Revenue growth versus the prior year was driven by our 2 largest brands as UGG increased 15% and to $1.982 billion, with growth primarily driven by wholesale refill in the U.S. and a return to growth within the brand's international regions as we signaled at the outset of fiscal year 2022. And HOKA increased 56% to $892 million, with growth driven by all global regions and channels of distribution.\nGross margins for the year were down 300 basis points versus last year to 51%. The decrease in gross margin was related to an approximate 370 basis point decrease from freight, primarily due to increased air usage and higher ocean container rates and unfavorable channel mix as wholesale growth outpaced direct-to-consumer, with partial offsets from a greater mix of HOKA revenue, fewer closeouts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. For the full fiscal year, we incurred freight costs that were more than $100 million above the prior year, excluding the impact of higher volumes.\nSG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.043 billion, up 20% versus the prior year, $870 million. SG&A represented 33.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 34.2% in fiscal year 2021. Higher dollar spend was primarily related to increased marketing to build global awareness of the UGG and HOKA brands, increased compensation costs for added headcount to support our scaling organization and higher warehouse costs to support the growth of our brands. This resulted in a full year 2022 operating margin of 17.9%, which is at the high end of our original guidance range of between 17.5% and 18%. Despite the freight cost being well above what we anticipated at the outset of the year, we were able to deliver this operating margin result through disciplined management of variable expenses.\nFor the year, our tax rate was 20%, which compares favorably to last year's 23.7%. Taxes were lower this year, primarily as a result of certain discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter and a higher proportion of international revenue. With these results, Deckers delivered another record diluted earnings per share of $16.26, which compares to $13.47 in fiscal year 2021. This result is more than $1 above the high end of our guidance range due to the strength of our fourth quarter. The $2.79 increase as compared to last year was primarily driven by: global UGG and HOKA revenue growth; net of increased marketing; a lower tax rate; a lower share count, reflecting the benefit of our most aggressive annual share repurchase to date; and favorable foreign currency exchange rates on net revenue, with partial offsets from higher freight costs from both airfreight utilization and climbing ocean rates, higher compensation costs with increased headcount, greater warehouse costs and variable expense growth in line with revenue growth.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2022, we ended the year with $844 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $507 million, up 82% from $278 million at the same point in time last year and up 63% versus 2 years ago, more closely aligned with the sales growth of 48% for the same period. And due to the significant increase of ocean freight rates in the second half of fiscal year 2022, this inventory includes approximately $50 million of embedded incremental ocean freight. And during the period, we had no short-term borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital above 35%.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $90 million worth of shares at an average price of $292.51. For the entire fiscal year 2022, we repurchased over 1 million shares for approximately $357 million at an average price of $341.77. At March 31, 2022, the company still had $454 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\nBefore moving to our outlook for fiscal year 2023, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our logistics network and the actions we are taking to mitigate any macro supply chain impacts on our business. Prolonged transit lead times, port bottlenecks related to trucking scarcity and ocean container shortages were the most material impacts to our business in fiscal year 2022, and we expect some of these pressures will continue as we begin fiscal year 2023.\nWhile I'm pleased to report that delays and pork backlog have improved, we remain cautious given the scaling size of our business risks that current or future COVID outbreaks or other global events have a domino effect across the supply chain and the potential for port labor disruption to occur later this summer. As such, we continue to prioritize receiving inventory into the country of sale and thus, expect inventory balances to remain elevated during fiscal year 2023. Given the momentum of our brands and our strong balance sheet, we are comfortable carrying higher levels of inventory to ensure demand will be fulfilled.\nFrom a factory production standpoint, we have been successful in securing additional production lines with existing partners as well as onboarding new partners. We believe this will support our plan to continue fueling the growth of our brands and anticipate that this new production will allow us to begin to see expanded capabilities and capacities as we ramp into fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nOn the cost front, we continue to see higher prices across the supply chain. But in some cases, we have seen some moderation. From an ocean freight perspective, we anticipate this to be a headwind to the first half gross margins as we lapped last year's first half lower cost. Additionally, we have been monitoring inflationary pressures on materials, but believe that impacts from ocean freight and materials inflation can be mitigated by the price increases we implemented for HOKA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and planned increases for UGG beginning in fall of 2022.\nBeyond that, we continue to anticipate using airfreight in fiscal 2023, but almost exclusively for the HOKA brand as we will work to fill production gaps caused by factory disruption. While we will experience savings from less air on the outside, we still anticipate using HOKA air freight during the year, which we do not intend to cover through pricing action.\nWith all that in mind, we have taken concrete steps to mitigate the impacts on our business from persistent supply chain disruption, including placing orders and taking possession of inventory earlier for in-demand items, carrying greater levels of inventory on key styles during this disruptive period using airfreight to strategically position HOKA for the global market share gain and improving our supply chain logistics capabilities. While some of these strategies will increase costs and reduce certain efficiencies in the short term, we believe these decisions support driving profitable top line growth over the longer term. Shifting to our outlook.\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, we expect year-over-year top line revenue growth of 10% to 11%, leading to revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, with HOKA growing in the mid- to high 30% range, reaching the $1.2 billion milestone on the low end; UGG growing low single digits, accounting for the wholesale revenue that shifted into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that we anticipate will sell through during the upcoming fall season; and wholesale and DTC growth at a similar rate, reflecting the impact of strategic growth initiatives across all brands.\nGross margin is expected to be approximately 51.5%, which is 50 basis points higher than last year. The increase over last year anticipates less air freight and benefits from select price increases within HOKA and UGG with headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates and continued impacts from higher ocean rates. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue. Higher spend is primarily related to: investments in talent and capabilities to scale the business and remain competitive in the marketplace, increased marketing to build global HOKA awareness and broaden the brand's consumer appeal and increased travel as markets open up.\nWith these gross margins and SG&A expectations, we expect an operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which is similar to fiscal 2022 levels and approximately 150 to 200 basis points above pre-pandemic levels despite persistent cost pressures related to supply chain disruptions and aligns with our commitment to remain top tier among our peer group even as we continue investing behind long-term initiatives. We are projecting a tax rate of approximately 22% to 23%. All of this results in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $17.40 to $18.25.\nThe Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, which is elevated versus prior years as we scale infrastructure to align with our growing organization. Key areas of investment include: additional warehouse space, capital IT projects and refreshing certain existing retail stores as well as opening strategic new locations for HOKA and UGG.\nOur fiscal 2023 guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact for additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and geopolitical tensions.\nWith continued uncertainty in the world and disruptions still impacting the supply chain, we will not be providing quarterly guidance. But similar to last year, we expect to drive full year growth and be profitable in all 4 quarters, but the quarterly cadence will likely be different than last year as we expect more pressure in the first half of the year compared to last. Some of the items driving quarterly differences year-over-year include: lower gross margins expected in the first half of the year as compared to last year due to higher ocean freight expense, planned increases to marketing investments in the first half to support HOKA launching its first major global campaign alongside new product introductions and higher talent costs related to investing in our workforce and adding headcount. With these impacts and a strengthening U.S. dollar, we expect lower profitability in the first quarter as compared to last year.\nThanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. Fiscal year 2022 represented another phenomenal year for Deckers as our portfolio of brands delivered revenue and earnings growth above 20%. We continue to drive progress towards our long-term vision to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive international markets through its strategic investments. These strategies continue to benefit our organization's focus and act as a North Star guiding to continued development of our portfolio of powerful brands while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability.\nOur consistent delivery of exceptional results often overshadows the progress our organization continues to make in doing good and doing great in the communities where we operate. We've made great progress with Deckers Gives, as our employees contributed more than 14,000 volunteer hours in fiscal year 2022; our DAI initiatives as we've improved bipart representation among our leadership teams to 21%, which is up from 12% 2 years ago. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work that continues to drive Deckers into the future. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support.\nBefore I turn over the call, I'd like to acknowledge our announcement earlier that Wendy Yang will be stepping down from her role as President of Performance Lifestyle effective as of the end of this month. On behalf of the entire Deckers team, I want to thank Wendy for her leadership and contributions over the past 7 years. With HOKA and Teva in their strongest position to date, I am confident in our ability to continue our positive momentum. I look forward to the future with this talented team and wish Wendy the best.\nWhile the company conducts a leadership search, Stefano Caroti, our President of Omnichannel, will assume Wendy's responsibility on an interim basis. Wendy will remain with the company in a consulting role through August 15, 2022, to ensure a smooth transition.\nAs we are now ready to take questions, again, I would like to say how proud I am of the Deckers organization and our accomplishments over the past few years. We have delivered impressive results and have built a strong foundation for the future. Our future opportunities are more exciting than ever, and I look forward to the journey ahead with our team.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm excited to review our third quarter results that underscore the momentum of our brands and their continued execution of key strategies as we build the future of Deckers brand. As we continue to navigate a challenging logistics environment, I reflect on both the exceptional demand for the UGG and HOKA brands and the added pressure we face to keep pace with their growth in a constrained environment. While we don't currently see signs that elevated logistics costs or supply chain bottlenecks will subside anytime soon, we do see value in supporting our strong brands through expediting key product inventory, giving our brands the opportunity to gain market share.\nSteve will provide a more detailed update on the status of our supply chain network and the actions we're implementing to provide our brands with the best opportunity to thrive in this challenging marketplace now and into the future.\nWith that said, Decker's third quarter revenue increased 10% over the prior year to $1.188 billion, representing our largest quarter in history. We saw balanced growth across our entire brand portfolio as direct-to-consumer, wholesale and multiple geographies drove impressive results. Performance in the quarter and throughout the year has been the result of our execution on our long-term strategy, including driving HOKA, diversifying UGG, building DTC and developing our international market.\nMore specifically, we have made progress across these key areas as HOKA grew 30% in the quarter despite port congestion and inventory constraint and has grown 54% year-to-date over prior year, contributing half of our total portfolio's incremental revenue.\nUGG increased 8% over last year in Q3 and has driven double-digit growth year-to-date, propelled by global adoption of the brand's diverse product assortment. Direct-to-consumer growth outpaced wholesale growth, improving DTC mix to 50% of third quarter revenue, up from 48% last year and 44% 2 years ago. And our international regions contributed a significant portion of global growth year-to-date, increasing 27% over the prior year and outpacing the U.S. increase of 19%. For UGG, our international regions have sold their most diverse offering of products ever, which helped the brand deliver impressive global growth fiscal year-to-date. In addition, with HOKA continuing to expand its share of the global performance market, we believe our portfolio contains 2 of the strongest brands in the footwear industry with much more promising growth ahead. Now let's get into some of the brand highlights, starting with UK. Global UGG third quarter revenue was $946 million, reflecting an 8% increase versus last year and a 21% increase versus 2 years ago in the brand's largest quarter.\nThese results, when combined with the UGG brand's outstanding first half, equate to fiscal year global revenue growth of 13% above last year and 21% above 2 years ago, reflecting the continued steady growth in the U.S., which is up high single digits on top of last year's mid-teens increase and a strong return to growth within the brand's international region, which have increased north of 20% versus last year. and double digits versus 2 years ago. All of which has been fueled by a diverse assortment of compelling UGG products across gender and categories that are being embraced by a broader and younger consumer base.\nIn terms of the UGG brand success, year-to-date, the majority of growth has come from categories outside of women's classic food. This includes continued gains across men's and kids footwear, women's slippers and fluff as well as apparel and accessories. While these categories are driving the bulk above growth, it is important to note that women's Classics have also performed very well this year. Fiscal year-to-date, women's Classic boots have driven year-over-year revenue growth represent a smaller percentage of total brand revenue and reflect greater style diversity within the category as items outside of the core, such as the Ultra Mini Classic Clear and new mill have been key drivers of consumer acquisition this year. The new mill with its broad consumer appeal is this year's largest dollar volume style across the entire UGG assortment. The UGG product and design teams have done a great job developing companion versions to build a franchise which continues to be a large driver of men's growth.\nAdditionally, our consumer data has shown that the adoption of UGG men's product skews younger, as the 18- to 34-year age group represents a larger portion as compared to the brand average. And the new melt remains a top acquisition style amongst these consumers. Our product teams are actively utilizing these insights to design new styles that will allow us to build upon momentum with these target consumers. Turning to kids footwear. UGG has driven impressive gains in kids categories over the past few years. We believe this is a strong indicator of brand health as purchasing patterns reflect consumers buying UGG for the family with the majority of top styles representing popular items from the men's and our women's product range. These bundled purchases are obviously great for increasing current values and wholesale open to buy but also act as a great avenue to introduce UGG to the next generation of consumers. Beyond footwear, UGG has been focused on acquiring new consumers through a compelling apparel assortment. To build awareness in the category, UGG developed its first-ever apparel dedicated marketing campaign, which helped drive a 40% increase in apparel consumer acquisition year-to-date.\nOur consumers have responded particularly well to ready-to-wear sportswear and outerwear items that contain visual DNA, logo treatment and deliver on the expected feeling of -- this was the first season for a number of retailers carrying apparel, many of whom are concentrated in the youth and sports lifestyle channels. These channels have been driving strong performance with our footwear for some time now and we're excited that they are on board to expand into a head-to-toe UGG offering. On the domestic front, this is the fourth consecutive year UGG has delivered strong year-to-date growth in the U.S. where brand consideration remains at an all-time high among 18- to 34-year-old according to Hugo. The brand's development of a more youthful and diverse product assortment as well as the ongoing U.S. wholesale marketplace management strategy has helped us strategically expand within youth and sports lifestyle accounts. While UGG has built market share across its account base, the youth and sports lifestyle accounts have significantly outpaced growth with department stores. Additionally, UGG has driven significant gains in DTC acquisition with 18- to 34-year-olds over the past 2 years, as this age group has grown at a 25% CAGR year-to-date over the same period of fiscal 2020. Critical to this success has been the product adoption among those younger consumers who are purchasing both heritage products like the classic short and mini but also new franchises like the Neumel, Fluff, Tasman and classic clear.\nFrom an international standpoint, regions outside of the U.S. have accounted for approximately half of UGG's growth this year, with EMEA and China driving the majority of gains over last year.\nApproximately 3 years ago, UGG implemented a marketplace reset strategy in the EMEA region based on the successful strategy that reignited the brand in the U.S. This involved a reduction of wholesale accounts to the tune of approximately 35% over the last 3 years, allocating and segmenting core product and elevating brand positioning while also working to create demand for complementary UGG products in new categories.\nBeyond the marketplace activities in EMEA, the UGG marketing team began localizing global content to more effectively connect with consumers living in European and Asian countries. More recently, UGG developed market-specific collaboration and brought on local influencers to help highlight the brand's compelling product. These actions have helped drive the international turnaround of UGG, which is now delivering growth in high full price sell-through with the brand's most diverse product assortment effort. Importantly, the return to growth of international UGG regions aligns with our global category growth initiatives, further aiding the brand's diversification into categories outside of women's classic. Fiscal year-to-date, women's core classics and derivatives have moderated to below 40% of international revenue. This is more in line with the U.S. and compares to north of 50% just 3 years ago. With a tightened supply of core product, international regions are driving healthy growth with popular global styles such as the Fluff franchise, Ultra Mini, Classic Clear and the new mill. By highlighting new categories, reducing the supply of core product and tailoring marketing campaigns to local consumers, UGG has begun to expand its audience to younger consumers in both Europe and China. In Europe, this has led to new strategic points of distribution in the youth and sports lifestyle channel.\nThe volume generated with these retail partners is still relatively small but growing significantly faster than average. And if the U.S. is any indication, these emerging segments can be a big driver of growth and volume in the future. Similar to the U.S., we believe younger consumers are leading the UGG brand increased popularity among international markets. The brand has worked hard to create localized content that resonates with sub 35 age consumers in their respective markets. In Germany, France and the U.K., this age group is driving over 40% of traffic conversion from paid social. In China, this age group is driving DTC growth in key franchises including global styles such as left and the classic Clear. The UGG team has a lot to be proud of with the progress it has made as the brand continues to drive global growth with a diverse assortment of in-demand product.\nLooking ahead, we were excited for us to build upon this year's head-to-toe demand with a compelling new rainwear proposition that features 2 new styles, the DSL and the Tasman which we believe will help the brand further expand its year-round appeal to consumers around the world. We are already receiving great feedback on the sell-through of this collection of rainwear product and are excited to share more on our year-end call.\nCongratulations to the team on a great fall season, and we look forward to continued success this spring. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue in the third quarter was $185 million, reflecting a 30% increase versus last year and nearly double the volume of 2 years ago, despite dealing with stockouts and delayed inventory, HOKA performed well in the quarter, driven by global strength in the direct-to-consumer channel, which increased 52% over last year, and continued global wholesale market share gains, particularly among international regions as unit growth outpaced domestic. Fiscal year-to-date global HOKA revenue has increased 54% versus last year, reflecting strength across the brand's ecosystem of Access Point as domestic, international, wholesale and direct-to-consumer continue to drive impressive growth.\nFrom a direct-to-consumer standpoint, we have seen strong global demand for HOKA year-to-date as U.S. search interest increased 74% over the prior year, according to Google trends. New consumers visiting the European HOKA website during Q3 increased 88% over last year helping the region maintain the highest CDC growth rate thus far in fiscal '22 and drove a more than 30% increase in conversion rate during China's Double 11 event, demonstrating improved awareness in the region. DC continues to be a great avenue for HOKA to make connections with consumers, drive replenishment and increased category adoption as it more effectively displays the breadth of the brand's product assortment. We are actively testing and developing the HOKA consumer experience at pop-ups in the U.S. and owned locations in China. In China, we plan to utilize strategic retail locations to continue building HOKA brand awareness as we develop the marketplace further and create a model for future wholesale partners to leverage. In the U.S., we have seen great engagement from consumers at pop-up locations and are exploring other select cities to test the HOKA experience. At the same time, HOKA is building the experience at DDC, the brand continues to build credibility and awareness with consumers through partnerships with strategic retailers. This spring, HOKA will be strategically expanding with key partners to satisfy incremental demand and further augment the brand's market share. We are pleased that our partners have continued to express excitement about the HOKA brand and their desire to expand further, and we look forward to continuing to grow those relationships.\nAt the same time, we remain disciplined in our approach to steadily and sustainably building HOKA to a multibillion-dollar brand over time. Shifting to product highlights for the third quarter. We launched the Bondi X at the beginning of October. This innovative style combines the signature cushion of a traditional bond die with a carbon fiber plate to give athletes a more propulsive and efficient ride. The Bondi X launch drove significant traffic to hoka.com, 65% of which were first-time visitors. The style was even named one of the best running shoes according to GQ's 2021 Fitness Awards.\nBeyond the Bondi X, the HOKA brand is expanding consumer awareness with 2 of its newer franchises, the Rincon and the Mac. Both franchises were designed for an audience of consumers under 35 years old. The HOKA team strategically developed Rincon and Mac social content for platforms, possessing a higher concentration of this key demographic. As a result, the Rincon and Mac have been key catalysts for the HOKA brands accelerated acquisition of younger consumers, and these franchises are driving superb growth. On the collaboration front, HOKA partnered with global luxury brand Moncler to release a limited edition of the HOKA (inaudible). This was a great opportunity to -- for HOKA build global awareness by partnering with a well-known European fashion luxury brand. The collaboration drove significant positive PR for HOKA and sold out in the first hour of availability.\nCollaborations like this are a great indicator of the brand's growing appeal beyond its traditional performance roots and into the space of fashion. While fashion is not a top priority for OCA right now, we see this as an opportunity for the brand to capitalize more broadly in the future. To close HOKA, I'd like to congratulate the entire team for the brand being named Footwear News Brand of the Year. This is a fantastic accomplishment and speaks to the incredible momentum of HOKA as the brand marches closer to $1 billion in revenue and beyond. We have enormous confidence in the brand's ability to continue building share in a highly competitive marketplace. While we continue to operate in this constrained environment, we are prioritizing the fulfillment of HOKA demand, though carefully balancing stringent quality standards as the brand's growth has required adding further manufacturing capacity. Ramping production of this highly technical performance product will require some additional time, but our measured approach will ensure HOKA is built to become a long-term major player in the performance space, while delivering the quality product our consumers expect.\nWith respect to channel performance in the third quarter, global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 13% versus the prior year and plus 42% versus 2 years ago. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 11% versus last year, fueled by strength in both retail stores and online. (inaudible) HOKA drove the majority of the year-over-year dollar volume increases, but DTC demand was robust across the portfolio. Facing bottlenecks during the UGG brand historical peak period of demand, we took specific actions that benefited UGG GDC, which included encouraging preorders on key styles to help smooth demand, carrying a broader exclusive assortment that provided the option of alternate in-stock products where there were shortages and offering the option to purchase back order products that had incoming inventory. In the constrained supply environment we have experienced this year, our omnichannel capabilities proved advantageous in reducing the impact on the UGG brand business. From a wholesale perspective, global revenue in the third quarter increased 7% versus last year and 14% versus 2 years ago. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by international UGG and global HOKA with slight offset from a reduction in domestic UGG that resulted from earlier shipments of fall products as compared to the prior year.\nWholesale comparisons remain unique as macro logistics pressures and bottlenecks continue to alter shipment timing as compared to historical patterns. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our third quarter financial results status of the dynamic supply chain challenges facing our industry and our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook. Steve?\n\nSteven J. Fasching\n\nCFO, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to echo Dave's remarks regarding the success of our key strategies. With 3 quarters of the year now behind us, including the peak UGG holiday season, we feel great about the strength of our brand portfolio. Throughout the year, UGG has driven global growth with a diverse assortment that is resonating with consumers across multiple categories, including apparel and accessories. At the same time, HOKA continues to build share with compelling performance products across its ecosystem of Access Point. The growth delivered by our 2 largest brands was achieved despite significant supply chain disruption, that we expect to remain a headwind for the foreseeable future. While this challenge persists, we have a great deal of confidence in the demand for our brands, bolstered by our omnichannel capabilities, flexible operating model and fortified balance sheet. Ultimately, we believe that prioritizing our long-term strategic goals will allow our brands to remain successful and drive continued market share gains. Now for the financial specifics of Q3 results, Third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue was $1.188 billion, representing a 10% increase versus last year and a 27% increase versus 2 years ago. Q3 growth was driven by our 2 largest brands, UGG and HOKA, as international UGG increased 29% versus last year, led by a return to growth in our EMEA region and an acceleration in China. And global HOKA increased 30%, aided by a more than 50% increase in DTC. Gross margins for the third quarter were down 470 basis points versus last year to 52.3%. The decrease as compared to last year was due to higher freight costs as ocean container rates have significantly increased. Third-party delivery fees have increased, and we have used a substantial amount of air freight. The increased cost in freight, including all of these components, amounted to approximately $55 million above last year in the quarter. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $328 million, up 15% from last year's $285 million. Increased spend was primarily driven by greater marketing expense to increase localized content highlight new categories and fuel brand heat globally as well as higher warehouse expenses as we grow our logistics network and other variable expenses. Our tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, and which compares favorably to the 22.2% last year due to discrete tax benefits and a higher proportion of international revenue.\nThis resulted in a diluted earnings per share of $8.42 for the quarter, which compares to $8.99 in last year's third quarter. The $0.57 decrease versus last year was primarily driven by lower gross margins that resulted from higher freight costs, higher marketing, warehouse and variable expenses with partial offsets from the revenue growth of our 2 largest brands and benefits from a lower tax rate and share count.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, we ended December with $998 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory, including in transit, was $551 million, up 80% from $305 million at the same time last year, with the large majority of that increase still in transit and delayed due to port congestion. And we had no outstanding borrowings. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $131 million worth of shares at an average price of $369.12. Fiscal year-to-date through December, we have repurchased approximately 736,000 shares, spending a total of $267 million.\nAt December 31, 2021, the company still had $544 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before we move into our final outlook update for fiscal year 2022, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our logistics network and the actions we are taking to mitigate future effects on our business. The most material challenge facing our business continues to be prolonged transit times for items produced overseas to reach our warehouses. This has led to a much higher proportion of inventory classified as in transit. At September quarter end, we noted that approximately 45% of inventory was in transit, which compared to roughly 20% in the prior year at the same point in time. As of December 31, we have not seen improvement as approximately 50% of our inventory remained in transit, which compares to roughly 25% in the prior year at 12/31. We do not expect this issue to be resolved near term. And as a result, we plan to carry elevated levels of inventory at fiscal 2022 year-end and into fiscal year 2023. We placing an emphasis on receiving product into the country of sale at the expense of inventory efficiencies in the short term. We will continue to utilize airfreight where strategically necessary to import products and leapfrog port congestion to maintain share.\nMore specifically, with the rate of growth our brands are experiencing, particularly HOKA which has more consistent demand throughout the year as well as a greater percentage of at-once business. Aligning sufficient inventory levels with elevated demand has become increasingly difficult. To help offset this issue, we have stepped up our airfreight usage to supplement ocean and port delays, but shipping by air is causing gross margin compression. Our strategy is to prioritize HOKA market share in the ultra competitive performance footwear space. And as such, we are willing to maintain higher air freight usage to fulfill this demand.\nMeanwhile, the HOKA team is actively working through product launch adjustments to best align with the current logistics environment. On pricing, we spoke last quarter about raising prices on select HOKA styles this spring and taking a look at UGG for the fall of 2022 season. Our product teams have completed a thorough review of their respective brand price elasticity and are continuing to adjust prices on target styles accordingly. While these changes can help offset some of the inflationary pressures on materials, we still expect elevated freight expense to be a near-term headwind above these pricing adjustments. Please note this does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year as pricing and freight are only a few of the many variables that factor into our gross margin forecast.\nFrom a factory production standpoint, we maintain a network of strategic third-party manufacturers and have been actively seeking additional production lines with existing and potential new partners. Despite ongoing activities, we expect some of our growth in the upcoming fiscal year to be limited by manufacturing capacity constraints to ensure product quality and integrity, particularly with HOKA, given the complex nature of the brand's high-performance products, it will take time to ramp up additional production. These efforts are made more difficult by the existence of the ongoing pandemic. We will provide a more thorough update on our fiscal year 2023 expectations during our year-end call in May. Now with that context in mind, and moving to guidance. For the full fiscal year 2022 and on revenue, we are narrowing our range to reflect a $20 million increase on the low end and maintaining the high end of our prior guidance, now expecting a range of $3.03 billion to $3.06 billion. This represents growth of approximately 19% to 20% over fiscal year 2021. Gross margin is now expected to be at or slightly below 51.5%. Included in this is our annual spend on freight that is now projected to be $100 million over last year. SG&A is still expected to be approximately 34% of revenue, and we expect our operating margin to land within the prior range at approximately 17.5% of revenue. We now expect a tax rate of approximately 21.5% for the year. And taking these into account, we are narrowing our prior earnings per share expectation to a range of $14.50 to $15.15 for full fiscal year 2022. At this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate additional significant supply chain disruption beyond what we have covered here today excludes onetime charges and does not contemplate impact from additional share repurchases. We look forward to providing additional updates on next year during our fourth quarter call in May. Thanks, everyone.\nAnd I will now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\n\nDavid Powers\n\nCEO, President, Director & Interim President of Fashion Lifestyle, Deckers Outdoor Corporation\n\nThanks, Steve. Our brands have performed exceptionally well this year, notwithstanding logistical challenges facing our industry. Fiscal year-to-date, Deckers has delivered revenue growth of 22% above last year and 37% above 2 years ago, while maintaining top-tier operating margins among peers. Our impressive margins have been achieved as we continue investing in the long-term future of our organization and prioritize growing the market share of our exceptional brands all while navigating headwinds related to the global pandemic and supply chain disruption. As I said at the opening, our brands are incredibly well positioned across the globe, but demand continues to outpace our current ability to supply it. And we are managing the business to deliver strong results in this uncertain environment. We have continuously evolved our strategies to mitigate the impacts of the dynamic state of the logistics environment. Key actions we are taking include tightening our product assortments to increase SKU efficiency, raising prices selectively based on assessing the competitive landscape of our brands, utilizing the strength of our balance sheet to carry increased levels of inventory in response to supply chain disruption optimizing channel mix to fulfill consumer demand and scaling production to support the growth of our brands. With the realities of the current logistics environment, we recognize that HOKA will remain in chase mode for much of the upcoming year. HOKA has tremendous runway ahead, and we will continue to provide the resources necessary to build HOKA into a major multibillion-dollar player in the performance space. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to recognize and thank our employees for how well they have managed an intense workload, especially as we all continue to deal with the added stress and struggles caused by the ongoing pandemic. We are doing our best to support our employees and their families through this difficult period of uncertainty. Thank you all for joining us today, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to sharing more on the bright future of Deckers brand. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Blake Vanier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vanier, the floor is yours.\n\nBlake Vanier\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me here in Miami Jason Liberty, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of the Royal Caribbean brand.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our investor website and in our earnings release. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency-adjusted basis.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business, and Naftali will follow with a recap of our third quarter, the current booking environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2025. We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to discuss our third quarter results, updated outlook and the many exciting initiatives fueling our momentum at the Royal Caribbean Group. This has been another great quarter for us. We continue to see strong momentum across our business, powered by accelerated demand, growing loyalty and all-time high guest satisfaction. Our commercial flywheel combining innovative ships distinctive destinations and world-class brands continues to drive sustained growth in guest trust and our ability to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly.\nBefore getting to the results for the third quarter, I want to highlight how we are continuing to build a stronger, further leading and more resilient vacation company for the long term. We are focused on building a vacation platform that continues to lead the leisure market through innovative ships, a growing portfolio of exclusive destinations, technology and AI that enhance every step of the guest journey. Together, these high-return investments, strengthen guest loyalty and attract new travelers positioning us to win more share of the fast-growing $2 trillion vacation market.\nEarlier today, we announced the Royal Beach Club, Santorini, further expanding our portfolio of exclusive destinations, extending our brands reach beyond the ship and meaningfully enhancing the guest experience. This reflects our vision to redefine how the world vacations. And together with the Royal Beach Club Paradise Island, Perfecta Mexico and others, we expect to increase our exclusive land-based destination portfolio from 2 to 8 by 2028. These initiatives reflect a thoughtful, sustained investment behind our commercial flywheel and reinforce the strength of our vacation platform.\nCruising and leisure travel continue to outperform the broader travel industry, and we are exceptionally well positioned to capture that momentum. With a powerful pipeline of strategic initiatives, a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to growth. We have both the resources and conviction to continue making game-changing investments that delight our customers strengthen our competitive advantage and drive long-term shareholder value. I want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team for their passion, dedication and commitment that enable us to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly and to drive exceptional financial results.\nTurning to our results and outlook. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations, driven primarily by strong close-in demand for vacation offerings and lower costs. In the third quarter, our capacity increased 3% and we delivered nearly 2.5 million incredible vacations, a 7% increase year-over-year at high guest satisfaction scores. Net yields grew 2.4%, driven by strong demand across all key itineraries. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $5.75 for the third quarter, which was 11% higher than last year. Naftali will elaborate more on Q3 results in a few minutes.\nMoving to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our capacity in the fourth quarter is up 10% year-over-year, and we expect to grow yields 2.2% to 2.7% on top of a 7% yield increase in the same quarter last year. Our fourth quarter outlook has been trivially impacted due to adverse weather and unplanned extension of the temporary closure of Labadi, 1 of our exclusive destinations. Despite these marginal headwinds we are expecting our total revenue to be up approximately 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Full year net yield is expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%, that's 25 basis points better than our initial expectations in January, which highlights the continued strong demand for our brands and the amazing vacations they deliver.\nOur yield growth this year is on top of several years of double-digit growth resulting in an industry-leading 31% yield growth compared to 2019. This highlights the remarkable transformation of our business and the enduring strength of our leading brands. Full year adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $15.58 to $15.63, a 32% year-over-year growth. We are also on track to deliver nearly $6 billion of operating cash flow this year, a significant step change in our performance. We are a growth company and our proven formula of moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline is driving significant earnings growth, continued margin expansion and robust cash flow generation.\nWe remain on track to achieve our Perfecta targets by 2027, a 20% compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share and return on invested capital in the high teens. As we've always said, Perfecta is an important milestone on our growth journey, but our ambitions go well beyond. The combination of our game-changing ships on order, our growing exclusive destination portfolio advancing our commercial technology platforms that are fueled by AI and disciplined capital management is setting up the post perfect era for another step change in the guest experience and financial performance.\nNow I'll provide some more insight into what we're seeing in the demand environment. Consumers continue to prioritize experiences and make room in their budgets for meaningful vacations. Our independent research, combined with millions of daily customer interactions continues to show positive sentiment towards travel and leisure and continued growth in spend. Roughly 3/4 of consumers intend to spend the same or more on vacations over the next 12 months, a level that has remained consistent for several quarters. While the broader consumer environment has normalized from the exceptional strength over the past 2 years, demand for experiences and leisure travel remains intact.\nCruising offers superior value for money versus alternative options driven by the high-quality onboard amenities and services, pricing, inclusive of meals and entertainment and the opportunity to visit a variety of destinations with the convenience of having everything in one place. Earlier this year, we announced our plans to launch a new vacation experience, Celebrity River. The introduction of Celebrity River has received an extraordinary response with all initially available deployment selling out almost immediately. The majority of book guests are Royal Caribbean Group loyalty members without prior river cruise experiences, highlighting a powerful opportunity to attract new guests to this segment and deepen engagement by creating new vacation occasions with our existing ecosystem.\nIn fact, the majority of guests shared their primary motivation for booking a Celebrity River vacation was the opportunity to experience a new celebrity product, driven by the trust and affinity they have for the celebrity brand. Guests are also motivated by our new rivership design and features with most of them expecting superior state rooms, ship amenities and outdoor spaces, all hallmarks of the brand. These early booking patterns are a powerful validation of our strategy to expand the Royal Caribbean Group vacatio ecosystem, creating new ways for guests to experience the world with us while deepening the connection to our family of brands. We continue to be encouraged by the demand environment.\nSince the last earnings call, bookings are up on both new and like-for-like hardware with particular acceleration for close-in families. Booked load factors for 2026 remained well within historic ranges at record rates, with booked APD growth at the high end of historical ranges. As always, we remain focused on optimizing our pricing and yield growth. Our spectacular new ships continue to generate strong quality demand. Star of the season is exceeding our expectations and Celebrity Xcel is shaping up to be the best performing new ship in the brand's history. The last 3 years saw unprecedented yield growth, and although that creates a high bar for comparables, our proven formula for success of moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost control is expected to continue to drive top line growth margin expansion and substantial cash flow.\nWhile still very early in the planning process, we anticipate earnings in 2026 to have a $17 handle on it. At the Royal Caribbean Group, we've always believed that clarity and conviction are competitive advantages. Our mission is clear to deliver the best vacations responsibly and our objective is just as ambitious to capture a greater share of the growing $2 trillion global vacation market by turning a vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. We don't just talk about that ambition. We built a robust multiyear plan that shows exactly how we intend to get there through bold high-return investments that strengthen our brands, elevate the guest experience and create long-term value for our shareholders. That includes our expansion into River, the ongoing expansion of our private destination portfolio, the transformational development of Perfect Day in Mexico and, of course, a steady stream of game-changing ships.\nThis quarter, we announced a long-term agreement with Meyer Turku securing shipbuilding slots through the next decade to continue both companies' tradition of innovation. The agreement confirmed an order for Icon 5 for delivery in 2028, added an option for a seventh icon class ship and positions us for a new game-changing class beyond ICON making the next stage at Royal Caribbean Group's history as we continue to redefine the future of vacations.\nIn a world where digital experiences also define customer expectations, we're working to set the standard. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities to engage customers, remove friction from the guest experience and drive incremental revenue. When we first introduced our app in 2017, the goal is simple. Give guests back the first day of their vacation by eliminating the need to wait in line for onboard reservations. Since then, the app together with our e-commerce engines, has evolved into a cornerstone for our e-commerce strategy, transforming from a utility into a powerful platform that drives revenue, improves operational efficiencies and deepened guest engagement.\nIn the third quarter, e-commerce visits and conversion rates both increased double digits versus last year, marking a very strong improvement for these channels. In addition, a record share of onboard revenue was booked pre-crews with nearly 90% of those purchases being made through our digital channels. And we continue to redefine loyalty in a way that deepens engagement and provides guests with greater flexibility in how they earn points and status. Building on the success of status match I'm excited to announce Points Choice, the next evolution and how guests earn and apply loyalty points across our family of brands.\nBeginning in early 2026, Guests will be able to apply loyalty points to the Royal Caribbean Group brand they prefer, regardless of which brand they are sailing with. This initiative further strengthens the overall value of our loyalty proposition deepening engagement across our portfolio and reinforcing our commitment to putting the guests at the center of our orbit. As our ecosystem expands, it creates a virtuous cycle of demand, value and advocacy one that drives both short-term performance and enduring growth. It's a model that compounds over time, and we're just at the beginning of what it can become. I am incredibly proud of our teams at the Royal Caribbean Group for their dedication and exceptional execution. The opportunity is significant, and we're well positioned to lead the next era of leisure travel.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing third quarter results. Net yields grew 2.4% in constant currency compared to the third quarter last year, 15 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. The yield outperformance was driven by the stronger-than-expected close-in demand. Yields grew across all key products and were mainly driven by existing hardware given the timing of new ship deliveries. .\nDuring the quarter, a record share of onboard revenue was booked pre-cruise and nearly 90% of those purchases were completed through our digital channels, with the app emerging as the fastest-growing driver of engagement and conversion across those platforms. NCC, excluding fuel, increased 4.3% in constant currency 195 basis points lower than our guidance as we continue to find ways to better deliver the best vacations without compromising the guest experience.\nAdjusted gross EBITDA margin was 44.6% and 60 basis points better than last year. And operating cash flow was $1.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were $5.75 and 11% higher than last year and 3% higher than the midpoint of our guidance. Earnings our performance was driven by the strong closing demand and lower costs.\nAs Jason mentioned, demand for our portfolio brands and industry-leading experiences continues to be very strong. Book load factors remain within historical ranges, at record rates for both 2025 and 2026. Capacity is expected to grow 5.5% for the full year and 10% in the fourth quarter. As expected, capacity growth in the fourth quarter is driven by new ships, start-up [indiscernible] and Celebrity Xcel as well as additional APCDs due to lower dry dock days compared to 2024. The Caribbean represents 57% of our deployment this year and 63% of capacity in the fourth quarter, a region where we hold a strong position and are advancing a series of strategic initiatives to reinforce that. These include industry-leading hardware, shorter and longer attractive itineraries, the upcoming Royal Beach Club Paradise Island and Perfect Day Mexico.\nOur Caribbean capacity is up 6% for the year and 10% in the fourth quarter. And even with capacity growth in the region, we see continued yield growth with Caribbean yields in the fourth quarter expected to be up compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Europe will account for 15% of capacity for the year and 9% in the fourth quarter and in a strong booked position as European season wraps up. Asia Pacific is expected to account for 11% of capacity for the year and 13% for the fourth quarter.\nNow let me talk about our updated guidance for 2025. Our proven formula for success, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline is expected to significant earnings growth and higher cash flow generation. We continue to expect net yield growth of 3.5% to 4% for the full year driven by gains in load factor and APD across new and lifelike hardware. Full year net gross excluding fuel, expected to decline approximately 0.1%, 40 basis points better than our prior guidance as we remain focused on better execution through leveraging our scale and utilizing technology and AI, all while ensuring strong customer satisfaction and enhanced product offering and vacation experiences.\nWe anticipate a fuel expense of $1.14 billion for the year, and we are 68% hedged below market rates. Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $15.58 and $15.63 and -- the $0.12 increase compared to our prior guidance is driven by Q3 outperformance, $0.02 of better Q4 performance, offsetting a $0.05 impact from recent adverse weather events and the unplanned extension of the closure of Labadie. We also expect 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA to just above $7 billion and 290 basis points growth in adjusted EBITDA margin. This positions us to accelerate our cash flow generation, which allows us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives, maintaining investment-grade balance sheet metrics and expanding capital return to shareholders.\nNow let me comment on fourth quarter guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect capacity will be up 10% year-over-year with net yield growth of 2.2% to 2.7%. As noted on the last earnings call, the timing of celebrity of excels delivery and fewer dry dock days versus last year will unfavorably impact fourth quarter net yield growth by about 90 basis points. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, I expect a decline between 6.6% and 6.1% during the fourth quarter. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $2.74 to $2.79.\nNow I will share insights for 2026 which is shaping up to be another very exciting year for us with multiple strategic initiatives that are already well underway. 2026 capacity is expected to be up 6% and as we introduce Legend of the Seas in Europe this summer as well as benefit from a full year of STAR and Xcel. Capacity growth is higher in the first and third quarter due to the timing of new ship deliveries and dry docks. In 2026, we expect to have more dry dock days compared to this year partially due to longer dry docks for several planned modernization projects of our existing ships. Caribbean capacity will represent about 57% of our deployment in 2026. For Caribbean products, we have continued to add shorter itineraries, building on our success in the last several years, enhanced by the opening of the beach flood in [indiscernible] this year. European itineraries will account for 14% of our capacity. Alaska and West Coast will account for about 10% and Asia Pacific will also account for 10%.\nAs Jason mentioned, book load factors remain within historical ranges at record rates for 2026. Bookings for 2026 have come in at APDs that are nicely higher than prior year resulting in 2026 booked APD growth at the high end of historical ranges.\nNow moving to costs. We remain committed to driving margin expansion supported by strong cost performance even as we advanced major initiatives throughout 2026, including the opening of the Beach Club in Nassau and the build-out of Perfect Day Mexico. Even with these strategic initiatives, the weigh on the NCCX metric, while being significantly accretive to margins, we expect anemic cost growth next year. We continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and are also hedging our rate exposure. Next year, we expect EU ETS to increase from 70% this year to 100% weighing on our energy efficiency gains.\nMoving belong the line. Keep in mind that announced dividends and already completed share repurchases were funded through a combination of strong operating cash flow and incremental borrowings, while maintaining our commitment to keep leverage below 3x. Additionally, we expect the global minimum tax policy updates beginning January 1, 2026, to impact us by an incremental -- 100 basis points. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted EPS to have a $17 handle, and we will provide more details during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity and its adjusted leverage that was below 3x on an LTM basis. We're in a very strong financial position, which allows us to fund our growth ambitions while also returning capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of investment-grade unsecured notes at 5 and [ 38 ] coupon. Proceeds were used to opportunistically finance the delivery of Celebrity Xcel at a lower cost than the existing committed ECA financing as well as refinance other debt. This was an opportunistic issuance where we utilize our strong investment-grade balance sheet to access the capital markets to finance a new ship delivery. We intend to continue to evaluate these types of transactions compared to existing committed ECA arrangements to lower cost of capital and gain tenure.\nWe have very limited maturities left for this year, all related to ship amortization payments that we plan to repay with cash flow. In connection with the debt offering, Fitch upgraded our clear rating to BBB and S&P update our outlook from stable to positive. We are very pleased with the recognition of the rating agencies of the strength of our balance sheet and our strong financial performance.\nIn September, we received a cash dividend of $258 million from our joint venture to Cruises, and we expect it to continue to pay a regular cash dividend given its strong financial performance and balance sheet. Also during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares. And as of September 30, we have $345 million still available under the current authorization. In September, the Board of Directors authorized a 30% increase to the quarterly dividend to $1 per common share. We remain focused on both growing the company through strategic investments as well as returning capital to shareholders. Since July 2024, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we intend to utilize our strong financial position to return capital going forward.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on our mission to deliver the investigation experiences responsibly as we wrap up another strong year and look ahead to an exciting 2026.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Blake Vanier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vanier, the floor is yours.\n\nBlake Vanier\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of the Royal Caribbean brand.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors.

Naftali will follow with a recap of our second quarter, the current booking environment and our outlook for 2025. We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to share our strong second quarter results and updated outlook for the year. Our world-class brands and the exceptional experiences they offer continue to resonate deeply with consumers driving both strong demand and excellent financial results. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations mainly driven by stronger-than-expected close-in demand, a shift in the timing of some expenses and favorability below the line that was mainly driven by the outperformance of our 2-week Cruises joint venture and lower interest costs. We are also increasing our earnings guidance for the year and now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 31% year-over-year.\nWe are delivering exceptional value to our guests while continuously raising the bar with a powerful pipeline of industry and segment-leading new ships, a growing portfolio of meaningfully differentiated land-based private destinations, adding new experiences to our ecosystem like river cruising, and deploying unmatched digital and AI innovation to enhance the guest experience and maximize margins. These key differentiators and accelerators are resulting in another significant increase to this year's earnings estimates and accelerating our path to achieving our perfective financial targets by 2027 as we continue to win share on the rapidly growing $2 trillion global vacation market.\nLike we have said before, our ambitions go well beyond Perfecta as our strategic initiatives are designed to drive significant growth for years to come. In 2028 alone, we expect significant benefits from our current strategies, which, among many others, include the launches of OASIS 7 and Edge VI as well as full year benefit of ICON 4, the full year operation of -- perfect Day Mexico, Royal Beach Club Lelepa at full capacity and the first complete operational year of Celebrity River. As we advance our journey to help our guests turn the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations, we're already creating lasting memories for our growing guest base and significant long-term value for our shareholders.\nI want to thank the entire team here at the Royal Caribbean Group for their passion, dedication and commitment to continue to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly every single day.\nTurning to our results and outlook. In the second quarter, our capacity increased 6% as we delivered over 2 million incredible vacations, a 10% increase year-over-year at high guest satisfaction scores. Net yield grew 5.2%, 70 basis points higher than our guidance that was driven by better-than-expected close-in demand across all key itineraries. Yield growth was split evenly between new hardware and the existing fleet. Load factor was 110%, 2 percentage points higher than last year, driven by contributions from new ships and improvements on a like-for-like basis across our itineraries, highlighting the continued strength and demand for our brands.\nWe delivered adjusted earnings per share of $4.38 for the second quarter, which was 36% higher than last year and exceeded our guidance by $0.33. The outperformance was driven by better revenue, a shift in the timing of some expenses and better below-the-line performance. Naftali will elaborate more on Q2 results in a few minutes. Now I'll provide some insight into the demand environment. Bookings have accelerated since the last earnings call, particularly for close and families. We continue to see engaged and excited consumers with roughly 75% intending to spend the same or more on leisure travel over the next 12 months. At the same time, more than half of consumers tell us they are booking closer to their departure date than they used to. And for the people who intend to travel over the next 12 months, the majority have not yet booked.\nOur book position is in line with prior years at higher APDs for both 2025 and 2026. In addition, onboard spend and pre-cruise purchases continue to exceed prior years. These trends are supported by the exceptional strength in our digital channels in terms of both cruise bookings and pre-cruise purchases. Our spectacular new ships continue to generate strong quality demand. Earlier this month, we took delivery of start the seas, and I can say that she is just as impressive as we have intended. We look forward to her star-studded launch in just a few weeks. Bookings for Star DCs and Celebrity Excel, which is coming in the fourth quarter, are strong in both pricing and load factor. We also recently opened the Royal Beach Club Paradise Island for sale and early demand has been incredibly strong, reinforcing our strategy of delivering exclusive destination led experiences and elevate the vacation value proposition within our ecosystem.\nWe conduct independent research and leverage data points for millions of daily interactions with our customers. We continue to see very positive sentiment from our customers, bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings and elevated wealth levels. Overall, consumers remain financially confident with 3 out of 4 indicating that they feel financially secure. Leisure and travel spend continues to grow, and leisure travel continues to be the #1 category when consumers plan to increase spending over the next 12 months. That's outpacing dining, live entertainment, shopping and even self-care.\nWe are also seeing strong intent across demographics, particularly among millennials and younger who continue to represent half of our customer base. They not only express a desire to travel more, but are increasingly choosing cruise vacations as the preferred way to celebrate meaningful life moments. Roughly 7 in 10 consumers in these younger generations are also more likely to book closer to departure, reflecting a desire for responsibility and flexibility. In addition, more than half of the millennials tell us that they are more likely to consider cruising today compared to 2 years ago, driven mainly by the attractive value proposition of cruise.\nValue continues to be a critical driver. Consumers consistently cite cruises as offering excellent value for money, thanks to our all-inclusive pricing, high-quality products and the unique opportunity to experience multiple destinations in a single trip. And among those who were on skeptical of cruising and growing share now say they are more likely to consider it than they were 2 years ago. Meanwhile, repeat cruisers continue to rate cruising as the best value for their vacation spend.\nWith brands that consistently lead in guest satisfaction and vacation options that range from weekend getaways to bucket less adventures on ocean and on land we continue to deliver on consumers' evolving expectations.\nMoving to our outlook for 2025. The year is on track to be another record year with net yield expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%, supported by new ships, like-for-like increases and the continued success of our private destinations. Our yield guidance does not factor in a further acceleration of closing demand within the quarter like we have recently seen. If current trends continue, it could lead to further yield growth above our guidance for the second half of the year. Full year adjusted earnings per share is now expected to grow 31% and be in the range of $15.41 to $15.55.\nThe improved guidance reflects our better-than-expected second quarter performance lower-than-expected spend and continued favorability below the line for the remainder of the year. In the third quarter, we expect to grow yields 2% to 2.5% on top of almost 8% yield increase in the same quarter last year. Our expected yield growth for the quarter is driven almost entirely by like-for-like hardware as a star of the C launch is very late in the quarter after the peak summer season. This timing, along with the operational ramp-up period, where we purposely limit load factor to ensure an exceptional experience impacts its contributions and creates a headwind to yield for the quarter of approximately 150 basis points.\nOur proven formula is working, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline and is driving significant earnings growth, continued margin expansion and robust cash flow generation. We remain on track to achieve our Perfecta targets a 20% compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share through 2027 and a return on invested capital in the high teens but our ambitions, as we said before, go well beyond. We are well positioned for our most ambitious chapter yet. It will reshape the vacation landscape and expand our leadership in leisure travel. It all begins with our world-class portfolio of brands, each leading and being the champion of their respective categories, both in trust and satisfaction while meeting the evolving needs of our guests. We amplify that strength with the most innovative shifts, exclusive private destinations and a connected ecosystem that makes planning and enjoying a vacation seamless and rewarding.\nOver the next few years, we plan to introduce 7 new ships, including Star of the Seas, Celebrity Excel later this year, followed by Legend of the Seas in 2026, Icon 4 and our first celebrity River in 2027. In 2028, we'll deliver was 7 and Edge 6, the next ship in the Celebrity Edge class. This study lineup will support our moderate capacity growth, enhance our global reach and further differentiate our collection of vacation brands.\nOn land, we're expanding our destination portfolio with Royal Beach Club Paradise Island opening in the Bahamas later this year, Royal Beach Club cash at the end of 2026 that in late 2027, perfect Day in Mexico, which is approximately the size of the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. -- will debut. Earlier this month, we officially closed on our acquisition of the Port of Costa Maya and are now well underway in bringing this exciting destination to life. In 2027, we'll expand the reach of our Royal Beach Club collection to the South Pacific with Royal Beach Club La Lelepa. These experiences are located across key strategic markets and are engineered to generate premium yields and returns for years to come.\nCentral to our destination strategy is a commitment to the economic development of these communities, generating thousands of jobs championing environmental restoration, improving wastewater treatment, conserving local native plants and species and supporting robust recycling programs as well as providing educational and training programs and infrastructure investment in roads and community centers. Our commercial flywheel is accelerating as we deepen relationships with our customers through digital innovation to remove friction, drive commercial opportunities and lower acquisition costs. Repeat bookings are meaningfully rising and cross-brand loyalty is accelerating with nearly 40% of all bookings coming from our loyalty members who spend 25% more per trip. Nearly 50% of onboard purchases are now coming through the mobile app compared to 1/3 at the end of 2023.\nAs a reminder, customers who purchase onboard experiences before their cruise spend about 2.5x more than those who do not buy pre cruise. We are investing in a modern digital travel platform infusing AI into almost everything we do and investing in enriched data to make it easier than ever for guests to book and design their dream vacations while allowing us to expand wallet share. App downloads have now surpassed $30 million and long-term adoption is increasing. We continue to invest in more commercial and experienced capabilities, increasing interactions and enhancing commercial features.\nLooking ahead, we are incredibly energized by the momentum we are building. These ambitious initiatives reinforce our flywheel, strengthen our ecosystem and unlock powerful new pathways for long-term growth as we continue turning the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. I am incredibly proud of our teams at Royal Caribbean Group for their dedication and strong execution. The opportunity ahead is significant, and we're well positioned to lead the next era of leisure travel.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing second quarter results. Net yields grew 5.2% in constant currency compared to the second quarter of last year, 70 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Yields grew across all key products and were evenly split between new and existing hardware. The yield outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected closing demand. Onboard revenue was higher than last year across all key categories as we continue to see a very engaged consumer. In the second quarter, approximately half of our onboard spend was booked before the sailing with 3 out of 4 guests making pre-cruise purchases to reserve onboard experiences.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered 2.3 million incredible vacations new to cruise or new to brand accounted for approximately 60% of our guests, of which more than half were millennials or younger. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 2.1% in constant currency, 180 basis points lower than our initial guidance driven by shifting of timing of spend that will roll into the second half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, 300 basis points better than last year and operating cash flow was $1.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were $4.38, 36% higher than last year and 8% higher than the midpoint of our guidance.\nEarnings outperformance was driven by the strong close-in demand, shifting timing of spend and favorability below the line, $0.10 per share of favorable timing of spend is expected to roll into the second half of 2025. As Jason mentioned, demand for our portfolio of brands and industry-leading experiences continue to be very strong. Bookings have accelerated since the last earnings call, particularly for closing sailings leading to the second quarter outperformance. Our book load factor is in line with prior years and higher APDs. Capacity is expected to grow 6% for the full year and 3% in the third quarter. As expected, capacity in the third quarter is the lowest throughout the year and is impacted by the delivery timing of Star of the Seas in late August.\nLooking ahead, fourth quarter capacity growth is expected to be 10%, benefiting from a full quarter of Star of the Seas, the launch of Celebrity Excel and additional APCDs due to lower dry dock days compared to '24. The Caribbean represents 57% of our deployment this year and 42% of capacity in the third quarter. Our leading hardware and private destinations strengthen our competitive position in this market for the introduction of Star of the Seas, Celebrity Excel and the opening of Royal Beach Club Paradise Island by the end of the year. Europe will account for 15% of capacity for the year and 28% in the third quarter. Alaska is expected to account for 6% of total capacity and 13% in the third quarter.\nNow let me talk about our revised guidance for 2025. Our proven formula for success moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline is expected to drive significant earnings growth and higher cash flow generation this year. We are increasing our yield guidance for the year and now expect net yield growth of 3.5% to 4%, driven by second quarter outperformance. As Jason mentioned, our yield guidance does not factor in further acceleration in close-in demand like we have seen recently, which could lead to more upside if these trends continue. The cadence of yield growth throughout the year, as expected, is driven by the timing of new ship deliveries and lower dry dock days in the fourth quarter.\nThe impact on yield growth is approximately 150 basis points in the third quarter and approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter. Full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be approximately 0.3%, 10 basis points lower than our prior guidance as we remain focused on efficiency, enhancing margins and maximizing cash flow. While we manage our costs more on a yearly basis, the cadence of our cost growth varies throughout the year. This is driven by timing of dry docks, ship deliveries and the ramp-up of costs related to our acquisition of the Costa Maya and other new private destinations. We anticipate a fuel expense of $1.14 billion for the year, and we are 66% hedged at below market rates.\nBased on our current fuel prices, Currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $15.41 and $15.55. The increase compared to our prior guidance is driven by Q2 outperformance of $0.23, taking into account $0.10 of timing shift of spend and $0.20 benefit from lower spend and below-the-line favorability for the remainder of the year. We also expect 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 260 basis points growth in adjusted EBITDA margin. This positions us to accelerate our cash flow generation, which allows us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives, maintaining investment-grade balance sheet metrics and expanding capital return to shareholders.\nNow let me comment on third quarter guidance. In the third quarter, we expect capacity will be up 3% year-over-year and a net yield growth of 2% to 2.5% driven almost entirely by like-for-like hardware as Star of the Seas launches very late in the quarter. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 6% to 6.5%, approximately 230 basis points of cost growth is attributable to the timing of delivery of Star of the Seas and the cost timing shift from the second quarter. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $5.55 to $5.65.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a strong $7.1 billion in liquidity. We are in a very strong financial position and will continue to further strengthen the balance sheet. During the first half of the year, we received investment-grade ratings by all 3 major credit agencies, reflecting the strength of our financial position, consistent performance and disciplined capital allocation strategy. We are proud of the hard work that has brought us here and remain committed to maintaining the strong momentum. In addition, we amended and upsized our 2 unsecured revolving credit facilities during the quarter bringing the combined revolving credit facilities commitments to $6.4 billion and extending the maturity of 1 facility to October 2030.\nWith a strong balance sheet, we are committed to investing in our growth strategies, delivering a competitive dividend yield and opportunistically buying back shares. We have very limited maturities left for this year, all related to ship amortization payments that we plan to repay with cash flow. We also expect leverage to be at mid 2 turns by the end of 2025.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on our mission to deliver the base vacation experiences responsibly as we work to deliver another year of strong performance.\nWith that, I will ask the operator to open the call for a Q&A session."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Blake Vanier, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Vanier, the floor is yours.\n\nBlake Vanier\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of the Royal Caribbean brand.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not under update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our investor website and in our earnings release. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our first quarter, the current booking environment and our outlook for 2025. We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to share our strong first quarter results and updated outlook for the year. During the first quarter, we delivered over 2 million unforgettable vacations at exceptional guest satisfaction scores and achieved financial results that exceeded our expectations.\nLikewise, WAVE season was the best in our company's history, putting us in a strong book position for the remainder of the year and for 2026. Clearly, consumers continue to use our vacations because we consistently deliver the best experiences and provide value to our guests.\nAs we look across the current macro landscape, we recognize that there is heightened uncertainty. However, research, including the direct surveying of our customers continue to show that the propensity to crews remains encouraging. The combination of the world-class experiences we deliver, continued strong secular tailwinds and the persistent value gap land-based vacation positions us well to navigate the current environment. I'll touch more on this in a little bit.\nWe are certainly not immune to macro volatility, but what we're seeing on the ground, in our bookings and the real-time spending occurring on our ships, is that consumers are still prioritizing experiences, planning to spend more on them this year and are seeking value that we are well positioned to offer.\nAt this point, it's still too early to determine how exactly the current macro environment could impact the broader economy or consumer behavior. What I want to emphasize is that we are focused on what we can control: delivering the best vacation experiences for our guests, optimizing revenue, managing costs and executing on our long-term strategies.\nOver the past several years, we have taken decisive steps to strengthen our balance sheet, and we continue to do so. We are in a very strong financial position, investment-grade balance sheet, strong cash flow generation, robust liquidity and minimal near-term maturities, and we remain focused on maintaining financial flexibility.\nWe are confident in our growth strategy and the incredible opportunity ahead of us, continuing to win a greater share of the growing $2 trillion vacation market, as we further progress from delivering the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations.\nWe also continue to invest in the future of fleet, our private destination portfolio and the guest experience. We do this all with the best talent, and I want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team for their passion, dedication and commitment to delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly after driving strong financial results.\nNow moving to our results and outlook. We are very pleased with our first quarter results which exceeded our expectations. Yields grew 5.6% and and we saw better-than-expected close-in bookings across all itineraries. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.71 in the first quarter was $0.23 higher than our guidance. Better revenue and favorable timing of expenses contributed to the better-than-expected earnings performance. Naftali will elaborate more on the first quarter results shortly.\nNow I'll provide some insight into the demand environment and WAVE season. During the first quarter, bookings outpaced last year across all products, resulting in the best WAVE season in the company's history. In the month of April, bookings for 2021 are outpacing last year, with close-in bookings trending particularly well. Our book position is in line with prior years at higher APDs.\nOnboard spending and pre-cruise purchases continue to exceed prior years, driven by increased participation in onboard activities and experiences at higher prices. All commercial channels are generating quality demand with particular strength in our direct-to-consumer channels. As always, we continue to possess a nimble and flexible sourcing model, both geographically and demographically, with the ability to source quality demand all over the globe.\nWe continue to be thrilled by the reception of our spectacular new ships, the enthusiasm for Star of the Seas, our second icon class ship; and Celebrity Xcel, the latest addition to the Edge class lineup, have exceeded expectations, driving strong pricing -- factors.\nAs we look at our current and potential consumers, we remain encouraged. While broader consumer spending moderated, vacation spend continued to grow as consumer sentiment around leisure vacations remains positive. Our customers continue to be engaged and excited about vacations.\nIn a research fielded in April, 7 out of 10 consumers told us that they intend to spend the same or more on leisure travel over the next 12 months, with spend on travel continuing to outpace major material purchases. And for 9 out of 10 consumers surveyed, value for money is crucial when making vacation plans, and this is where we continue to excel.\nFurthermore, when financial concerns impact lifestyle or spending, travel is not the first place consumers indicate they will pull back. Cruisers are more financially secure and more likely to protect their travel budgets during times of uncertainty.\nWe are very well positioned to deliver great vacations from multiple occasion, close to home for millions of people in the U.S., offering them extraordinary value through a range of itinerary options from 3 to 10 days from Florida, Texas, California, the Northeast and the Northwest. Our vacation experiences remain in an attractive value proposition and leading guest satisfaction compared to other vacation alternatives.\nConsumers recognize that our brands are superior value for money versus alternative options. That value is made up of unique ability to give guests the opportunity to visit a variety of destinations in one trip, the convenience of having everything in one place, plus our high-quality onboard amenities and services, and pricing that includes meals, accommodations and entertainment.\nNow let me provide an update on our outlook for 2025. Please note that our guidance ranges are expanded compared to those we would typically provide and are based on current demand trends, while also considering the complexity of the macro environment based on what we know today.\nCapacity is expected to grow [ 5.5% ] in 2025, driven by the introduction of Star of the Seas and Celebrity Xcel, as well as the full year benefit of Icon, Utopia and Silver Ray. Yield growth is expected to be in the range of 2.6% to 4.6%, supported by the incredible appeal of our new ships, the performance across our existing fleet and the continued success of our private destinations.\nFull year adjusted earnings per share guidance is now expected to grow approximately 28% and and be in the range of $14.55 to $15.55. We are benefiting from better-than-expected first quarter performance and favorable foreign exchange and fuel rates. While we remain cognizant of macroeconomic uncertainties, recent booking trends, disciplined cost management and strong balance sheet positions us well to deliver another year of strong earnings growth and cash generation.\nOur formula of moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost control continue to drive superior financial performance. And we remain focused on executing our Perfecta performance program, targeting a 20% compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings per share through 2027 and return on invested capital in the high teens.\nWe are relentlessly focused on delivering and innovating the best vacation experiences on the planet. And a key differentiator for us is our powerful commercial flywheel where, each guest experience fuele deeper loyalty and more engagement, which enables us to give guests the vacation experiences they want so they keep coming back.\nIt starts with our exceptional portfolio of brands, the category leader designed to cater to the diverse needs of our global guest base. We amplified strength with industry-leading ships, exclusive private destinations and continuous innovation that elevates every aspect of the guest journey.\nOver the next 3 years, we will introduce 7 game-changing new ships, including Star the Seas and Celebrity Xcel in 2025. We'll launch Celebrity River in 2027 and expand from 2 to 7 exclusive destinations.\nWe deepen customer relationships through data, personalization and a frictionless experience that makes planning and enjoying a vacation seamless. Our unified and loyal programs connect all our brands under one ecosystem, encouraging repeat travel and unlocking more opportunities to engage across ocean and river cruising, along with our exclusive destinations.\nThe ecosystem is working. Members of our loyalty programs accounted for nearly 40% of our bookings last year, with cross-brand bookings increasing. Loyalty members are more likely to book direct and spend 25% more per trip than nonmembers. On the digital front, bookings in our app [ slowed ] so far this year, and loyalty members are more likely to book in approximately than non-loyalty members.\nOver the last 10 years, we've improved the rate at which guests rebook within 3 months by 1.7x and increase Net Promoter Score by 15 points. These results have translated into 50-plus percent net yield growth over that time period, and we're just getting started.\nLooking ahead, we are incredibly energized by the momentum we're building. Ambitious initiatives reinforce our flywheel and strengthening our ecosystem as we turn the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations.\nI'm incredibly proud of the teams at the Royal Caribbean Group for their passion and relentless focus on delivering great vacation experiences for our guests. We are executing from a position of strength, and I remain optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing first quarter results, which were above our expectations.\nAdjusted earnings per share were [ $2.10 ], 9% higher than the midpoint of our guidance. We had a great first quarter that was driven by better-than-expected pricing on close-in demand and $0.08 per share of favorable timing of expenses. We finished the quarter with a net yield increase of 5.6% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2024, 60 basis points above the midpoint of our initial guidance in late January. Most of our yield growth was driven by strength in ticket pricing versus '24.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased [ 0.1% ] in constant currency, 175 basis points lower than our initial guidance, driven entirely by timing of expenses that will roll into the second quarter and some of the rest of the year. Our EBITDA margin was 35%, 360 basis points better than last year. And operating cash flow was $1.6 billion.\nAs Jason said, we had a record WAVE season and our book load factor is in line with prior years and at higher APDs. Bookings since the beginning of April continued at a higher pace than last year, including strength in close-in demand and cancellation levels remain normal.\nThe Caribbean represents 57% of our deployment this year and 49% of capacity in the second quarter. In 2025, we offered Caribbean sailings from 9 U.S. home ports -- Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Port Canaveral, Galveston, Baltimore, Cape Liberty, San Juan and New Orleans, and a variety of sailing length.\nOur leading hardware and destinations strengthen our competitive position in this market, with the introduction of Star of the Seas in late August, Celebrity Xcel in November and the opening of Royal Beach Club Paradise Island by the end of this year.\nEurope will account for 15% of capacity for the year and 20% of capacity in the second quarter. Alaska is expected to account for 6% of total capacity and 9% in the second quarter. We have also some of the best hardware in the region with Celebrity Edge, 2 Quantum class ships and Silver Nova.\nNow let me talk about our guidance for 2025. Our proven formula for success: moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline, is expected to drive significant earnings growth and higher cash flow generation this year.\nMoving to the revenue guidance. We are increasing our guidance for the year compared to our prior one in January. We did expand our typical guidance ranges to account for the broader external factors and the complexity of the current macroeconomic environment.\nFor the full year, we expect yield growth of 2.6% to 4.6%. As a reminder, first quarter yield growth disproportionately benefited from both the timing of drydocks and new hardware, a full quarter of Icon, in addition to Utopia and Silver Ray. The cadence of yield growth throughout the year, as expected, is driven by the introduction of Star of the Seas and Celebrity Xcel into third and fourth quarters, respectively.\nThe impact of the timing of new ship deliveries on yield growth in the second half of this year is a headwind of approximately 140 basis points.\nFull year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be negative 0.1% to up 0.9%, 10 basis points lower than our prior guidance, as we remain focused on efficiency, enhancing margins and maximizing cash flow. While we manage our costs more on the yearly basis, the cadence of our cost growth varies throughout the year. This is driven by timing of dry docks, ship deliveries and the ramp-up of costs related to our acquisition of the Costa Maya and other destinations.\nSecond and third quarter cost growth is expected to be higher than the first and the fourth quarter, with the third quarter being most impacted by 280 basis points from these headwinds. We anticipate a fuel expense of $1.14 billion for the year, and we are 59% hedged at below market rates. We are benefiting from the current low rates and have capitalized on this opportunity by executing hedges for the upcoming years at very favorable rates.\nBased on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest expense, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $14.55 and $15.55. The $0.55 increase compared to our prior guidance is driven by a $0.37 benefit from FX and fuel rates for the remaining of the year, a $0.05 bid from a lower share count due to share repurchases, with the remainder attributed to the outperformance in the first quarter.\nWe also expect 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 210 basis points growth in gross EBITDA margin. This positions us to accelerate our cash flow generation, which allows us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives, maintaining investment-grade balance sheet metrics and expanding capital return to shareholders.\nNow let me comment on second quarter guidance. In the second quarter, we expect capacity will be up 6% year-over-year and a net yield growth of 4.3% to 4.8%. Roughly half of the yield increase is driven by new hardware and the rest is driven by higher rates and load factors on like-for-like hardware.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 3.7% to 4.2%. This includes higher dry dock days in the first half of the year compared to last year, and 140 basis points impact from first quarter cost timing shifts. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $4 to $4.10.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a strong $4.5 billion in liquidity. We're in a very strong financial position, and we'll continue to further strengthen the balance sheet.\nDuring the quarter, S&P Global Ratings upgraded our credit rating to investment grade, reflecting the strength of our financial position, consistent performance and disciplined capital allocation strategy. We are very pleased with this acknowledgment of the strong trajectory of the business and our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet.\nAlso during the quarter, we exchanged $213 million of our outstanding convertible notes for cash and stock. This transaction reduced our fully diluted share count by 1 million shares. We have $110 million left outstanding that we plan to settle at maturity.\nDuring the quarter, we also repurchased 1 million shares under our 1 billion share repurchase program. As of March 31, we have $759 million available for repurchases under the current authorization. We will continue to opportunistically buy back shares while ensuring a strong balance sheet.\nWe have very limited maturities last year, all related to ship amortization payments that we plan to repay with cash flow. We also expect to further reduce leverage to below 3x by the end of 2025.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on our mission to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly as we work to deliver another year of solid returns.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to discuss our exceptional fourth quarter and full year results, our outlook for '25 and the many exciting things happening at the Royal Caribbean Group. 2024 was an incredible year, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We delivered a record 8.6 million memorable vacations at very high customer satisfaction achieved and 11.6% net yield growth generated more than $5 billion of operating cash flow and return the balance sheet to investment-grade metrics. We achieved our trieffective finance goals 18 months ahead of schedule and at the same time, we expanded capital allocation, all while continuing to invest in the business to support our growth ambitions. We also met our double-digit carbon intensity reduction target a full year ahead of schedule.\nThese strong financial results set the foundation for a very bright future, which is truly just beginning for us. With our industry-leading global brands, the most innovative fleet and private destinations and the best people, we remain focused on winning a greater share of the $2 trillion vacation market. Our plan to capitalize on this opportunity continues to be grounded in our proven formula for success, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost control. I want to thank the entire World Caribbean Group team for their passion, dedication and commitment that enables us to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly and to drive exceptional financial results.\nBefore getting into the details, I would like to take a moment to discuss an exciting new chapter in our mission to deliver the best vacation experiences. Celebrity River Cruises which we announced this morning, will unlock exciting new opportunities for our guests, our business and our shareholders. Beginning in 2027, Celebrity River Cruises will provide yet another opportunity for guests to explore even more destinations with our leading brands. We placed an initial order for 10 transformative ships, which will serve as the foundation for this new edge class inspired product. Our ambition, however, go far beyond that. We see River Cruising as an exciting growth opportunity that aligns with our strategy of turning the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. Expanding our ecosystem of vacation offerings and broadening our reach into adjacent lines of businesses. River Cruising is a sizable and attractive market that has experienced double-digit growth over the last decade. Driven by increasing demand from both seasoned cruisers as well as new customers. It is a very fragmented market that presents an exciting opportunity for us to win substantial market share. It delivers attractive APDs that we can capture while deepening customer loyalty within our family of brands. River Cruising is a complementary high-margin, high ROIC business that fits nicely within our portfolio. The smaller scale of River ships and shorter build time lines allow us for faster deployment and return profiles.\nCelebrity River Cruises is a natural extension of Celebrity's premium Ocean offering and appeals to a similar demographic of discerning travelers who value immersive destination-focused experiences. River Cruise has been a disproportionate amount of their time and money on travel including more spend on all types of cruises. We have a remarkable opportunity. Approximately half of our guests have either already experienced or intend to take a cruise vacation and a majority of guests would add an additional vacation to take a River Cruise. Further Celebrity existing reputation for exceptional hospitality and unparalleled experiences will attract new demand from travelers who are curious of River Cruising, but who haven't yet taken that lead.\nJust as we've set the standard of excellence in Ocean cruising, we will continue to innovate and elevate in the river space. The quality and sophistication of our edge class ocean ships will bring cutting-edge design, sustainable technologies and reimagined onboard and shore experiences that raises the bar for River Cruising. This is an exciting time for the Celebrity brand as this news follows our recent agreement to order a [ 6 ] edge class ship set to be delivered to celebrity cruises in 2028. Edge also known as Excel 2, will be the sister ship to Celebrity Excel, which is gearing up for its inaugural sailing later this year.\nSo now let's talk about 2024 results and 2025 outlook. I am proud of what we have accomplished in 2024. We delivered double-digit yield growth and generated $0.5 billion more in revenue than we originally expected. Our strong performance was propelled by the flawless execution of our [ naval ] team, which drove elevated demand across our brands. We also continued our focus on driving durable margin expansion resulting in 74% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. We continue to invest in our future while strengthening the balance sheet, achieving our target of investment-grade metrics and reaching mid to ROIC. The year ended on a great note with revenue yields up 7.3% in the fourth quarter, earnings that were $0.20 better than our guidance and a strong book position for 2025 from both a pricing and volume standpoint.\n2024 was another year of remarkable innovation as we ushered in a new era of vacations with the launch of Icon of the Seas, Utopia of the Seas and Silver Ray, while netting and advancing several key private destinations that will further differentiate our leading portfolio of brands, including Perfect Day Mexico, Royal Beach Clubs and Paradise Island and Cozumel. We received exceptionally high guest satisfaction scores and attracted a record number of both new and loyal guests.\nWe continue to fit our commercial and vacation experiences flywheel. In 2024, we expanded our capabilities across distribution channels to create a digital experience that connects the dots across all aspects of the consumer journey. Guests have been seamlessly planning and booking their dream vacation, reducing the amount of time to book a cruise by half. We launched over 300 new digital capabilities across -- 2024, improving the overall experience and reducing friction points while increasing spend.\nWe also infused AI into the guest journey to provide a better, more efficient experience and more personalized service. For example, our new in-app chat saw a 35% increase in guest adoption that led to a 20% reduction in the customer service line onboard. With 9 out of 10 guests indicating their intent to repeat our new loyalty status match program allows our guests to earn loyalty status across all 3 brands, fostering long-term relationships and rewarding loyal customers across our portfolio.\nTurning to this year. Momentum continues in 2025 with bookings existing since the last earnings call, resulting in the booking weeks in the company's history. Bookings have continued to outpace last year across all key products. Our book position is in line with prior years at higher APDs, allowing us to optimize pricing and yield growth as we continue to build the book of business for 2025. As our bookings for 2025 have ran up since the last earnings call, our APD premium to last year has widened, underlining our continued focus on optimizing yield growth. Our commercial apparatus is firing on all cylinders and all channels are delivering predemand above 2024 levels. Our direct-to-consumer channels are performing extremely well. We added hundreds of new capabilities across our digital platforms last year as consumers' preference for digital engagement continues to grow. Our travel partners are also delivering meaningfully more bookings than last year at higher rates.\nWe continue to see particularly healthy demand from North America where 80% of our guests will be sourced this year. Our brands, global appeal and our sourcing model allows us to attract the highest yielding guests by positioning our ships in multiple markets around the world. Our brand lead in their respective segments and are very successful at capturing quality demand across sectors and sourcing from the consumer bases.\nAs we think about consumer end for 2025 and beyond, we look to both macro trends and data points from millions of interactions with our customers. We continue to see very positive sentiment from our customers, bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings and elevated wealth levels. At the same time, they continue to prioritize travel experiences.\nAmerican households are wealthier than ever with continued wage growth and low unemployment driving strong consumer spending. We see positive sentiment from our customers in a macro environment that favors experiences over things as leisure and travel spend continue to grow. Consumers plan to spend more on vacations and take more trips in the coming year and our guests over index in their intent to spend more on leisure travel. Consumers place significant value on visiting multiple destinations and this is even more important to millennial and Gen Z consumers. Something that cruising is uniquely positioned to deliver on. Cruise consideration is high with the biggest gains among millennials and younger travelers. Cruise remains an attractive value proposition and also leads and guest satisfaction compared to other vacation alternatives. We are very well positioned to benefit from these trends with our exceptional and leading portfolio of brands, innovative and differentiated ships exciting and exclusive destination experiences and leading commercial and AI-driven capabilities.\n2025 is shaping up to be another great year with 23% expected earnings growth and accelerated path towards robust cash flow generation. In 2025, we expect to grow capacity by 5% through the introduction of Star of the Seas and Celebrity Excel as well as the full year benefit of Utopia of the Seas and Silver Ray.\nNew ships not only elevate our vacation experience and draw new customers to our brand, but also provide yield tailwinds and enhance overall profitability. We expect yields to grow 2.5% to 4.5%, driven by the performance of our entire fleet, new and existing ships combined with our leading private destinations and strengthening commercial apparatus. Strong rates and load factors, together with continued focus on margins and strategic capital allocation are expected to drive adjusted earnings per share of $14.35 to $14.65 which includes $0.65 of FX and fuel rate headwinds compared to our last earnings call.\nOur proven formula for success is working, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost control leads to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance. For decades, the Royal Caribbean Group has been redefining what a vacation experience can be. It's clear that our success has been built on a foundation of differentiation, setting ourselves apart through innovation and excellence. We have led the way in delivering best-in-class ships that redefine possible. As we look ahead, we continue to redefine vacations through the ambition expansion of our private destination portfolio, the exciting entry into new lines of businesses like Celebrity River Cruises, and the development of industry-leading digital and AI capabilities. We relentlessly pursue an acute understanding of how today's families, couples and individuals want to spend their valuable vacation time so that we can continue to develop an expanding ecosystem of vacation experiences that wildly exceed their expectations. Our goal is to create seamless, personalized journeys across a portfolio of experiences from ship to private island to River Cruises and beyond that inspire loyalty, deepen relationships and position us as a preferred choice for every kind of vacation.\nThis is not just a strategy, it's a promise to redefine what travel means for our guests. It's about meeting them where they are dreaming alongside them and turning the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. With this vision, we are poised to lead not just the cruise industry, but the broader world of travel into an exciting new era. Through it all, we remain committed to our seed to future vision, sustaining the planet energizing communities and accelerating innovation.\n2024 was an exceptional year for our company, marked by many milestones that set the stage for an even brighter future. We are continuously elevating what it means to deliver the best vacation experiences, inspiring ships and unparalleled private destination portfolio and globally trusted brands, all propelled by the best people. Royal Caribbean Group is redefining what people have come to expect from a vacation. As we embark on 2025, we remain focused on winning an even greater share of the broader vacation market and we are just getting started.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will start with reviewing fourth quarter results. Our teams delivered another exceptional quarter that exceeded our expectations, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.63. The outperformance compared to our guidance is driven by better revenue across our brands and products and strong cost performance despite a headwind from stock compensation due to increase in our share price. We finished the fourth quarter with a net yield growth of 7.3%, 200 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance that was driven by stronger-than-expected APDs from both new ships and like-for-like hardware. We also saw both better pricing on ticket as well as better-than-expected onboard spend.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 13.5% in constant currency. The increase in costs compared to guidance is entirely driven by a 300 basis point impact from higher stock-based compensation due to the rise in the stock price. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, 10% year-over-year growth and operating cash flow was $1.5 billion.\nNow switching to our 2025 outlook. I will start by taking you through capacity and deployment for the year. With the introduction of Star, Excel and a full year of Utopia and Silver Ray, capacity is expected to increase 5.4% year-over-year. We have fewer dry dock days this year compared to 2024, contributing about 1 percentage points to capacity growth. This year, we also have some of our biggest ships planned for dry dock and we also have restarted our modernization program that has more days for each dry dock. As a result, we have less dry dock days than 2024, but more days than 2023.\nIn terms of quarterly cadence, the first quarter has more dry docks than last year, negatively impacting capacity growth by 300 basis points. The second and the third quarter are relatively flat to last year, while the fourth quarter will have fewer dry dock days compared to last year, benefiting capacity growth by 500 basis points. As a result, APCDs are expected to grow around 3% in the first and third quarters. 6% in the second quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. New hardware in 2025 represents 4% of total capacity growth compared to 8% in 2024.\nAs Jason mentioned, the year is off to a very strong start. Last quarter, we said the demand for 2025 is strong with book load factors in line with prior years and at higher rates, allowing for further pricing and yield growth as 2025 bookings continue to ramp up, and that's exactly what is happening. Since the last earnings call, we've continued to build load factors while also expanding our booked APD versus the same time last year. The Caribbean presents 57% of our deployment this year, and capacity in the region is up 6% over last year. With the introduction of Star of the Seas and Celebrity Excel in the second half of the year. We continue to differentiate in the Caribbean market with our incredible ships and private destinations driving very strong performance. Over 70% of guests on these itineraries sailing with the Royal Caribbean brand will visit a private destination this year, and that percentage will increase to 90% in 2027 with the opening of the Beach Club at Paradise Island, Nassau and Cozumel and Perfect Day Mexico. Caribbean bookings have been strong. with Icon and Utopia continuing to perform well above expectations on top of strong performance of existing hardware.\nEurope will account for 15% of capacity and is up 5% versus last year. European sailings continue to perform very well on both rate and volume basis. Alaska is expected to account for 6% of total capacity. We have some of the best harbor in the region, including Celebrity Edge, 2 Quantum class ships and Silver Nova, among others. Alaska demand has been very strong and continues to surpass our expectations.\nNow let me talk about our guidance for 2025, our proven formula for success, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline is expected to drive 23% earnings growth and higher cash flow generation this year. We expect yield growth of 2.5% to 4.5%, balanced between new and existing hardware. Our 2025 yield growth outlook is on top of 11.6% growth in 2024 that was boosted by fourth quarter outperformance and put 40 basis point headwind on this year's growth metric.\nFull year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be flat to up 1%. Our focus remains to enhance margin as we continue to grow the business. The cadence of our cost growth varies throughout the year with second and third quarter costs expected to be higher than the first and fourth quarter, driven by timing of dry docks, ramp-up of costs related to our acquisition of the Costa Maya port and other destinations. We anticipate a fuel expense of $1.17 billion for the year, and we are 60% hedged at below market rates.\nBased on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest expense, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $14.35 and $14.65. I would also note that this range includes $0.65 headwind from foreign exchange and fuel rates since the last earnings call when we shared our preliminary expectations for the year. We also expect 13% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 150 basis points growth in gross EBITDA margin. This positions us to accelerate our cash flow generation, which allows us to continue investing in game-changing strategic initiatives, maintaining investment-grade balance sheet metrics and expanding capital return to shareholders. We expect to invest $5 billion of capital into our key strategic growth initiative as well as ensuring our assets are well maintained. We are set to deliver start of the fees in the third quarter and Celebrity Excel in the fourth quarter with both ships having committed financing in place.\nNon-ship capital is expected to be $1.6 billion with a significant portion related to our private destination portfolio, including the acquisition of the Costa Maya port that we announced last year the Beach Club in Cozumel and the Beach Club in Nassau that is expected to open in the fourth quarter of this year.\nNow I will discuss our first quarter guidance. In the first quarter, capacity will be up 3% year-over-year. More than 70% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 19% in Asia Pacific and the remaining capacity spread across several other itineraries. Net yields are expected to be up 4.75% to 5.25% with growth coming from both new and existing hardware across all products. First quarter yield growth disproportionately benefits from both the timing of dry docks and new hardware, a full quarter of Icon in addition to Utopia and Silver Ray. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 1.6% to 2.1% and include 130 basis points impact from increased dry docks compared to the first quarter of 2024. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $2.43 to $2.53.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We -- quarter would $4.1 billion in liquidity. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position to support our growth ambitions while expanding capital allocation. At year-end 2024, our balance sheet was unsecured and leverage was at low 3x, consistent with the goal of investment-grade credit metrics. With the strong expected cash flow generation and increase in EBITDA, we expect to finish 2025 with leverage at mid- to high 2x. We will continue to manage maturities and find opportunities to reduce cost of capital.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on our mission to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly as we work to deliver another year of solid results.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Michael McCarthy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McCarthy, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our investor website and in our earnings release. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency-adjusted basis.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our second quarter, the current booking environment and our updated outlook for 2024. We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I am proud to share our outstanding second quarter results and the continued upward trajectory of our business. As you saw in the press release this morning, our momentum continues. Demand for the incredible experiences our leading brands deliver continue to be robust. As a result, we achieved Trifecta 18 months early. We are reinstating a dividend, and we are raising our full year guidance.\nLess than 2 years ago, we announced Trifecta, a 3-year financial performance program that created the pathway back to what we internally call base camp. We said we would deliver triple-digit adjusted EBITDA per APCD, double-digit adjusted earnings per share and return on invested capital in the teens.\nToday, I'm delighted to share that we have achieved all 3 Trifecta goals on a trailing 12-month basis, 18 months ahead of the schedule. In addition, our leverage is now below 3.5x when excluding the impact of new ships that were delivered midyear. With Trifecta accomplished and our balance sheet in the strong position, we are excited to broaden our capital allocation by reinstating a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Capital returns that include a competitive dividend have always been and will continue to be a key pillar of our strategy to supplement our growth as we focus on delivering long-term shareholder value.\nI want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team for their passion, dedication and commitment. Their efforts helped accelerate our path to reaching Trifecta and will continue to ensure us to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly while driving exceptional financial results.\nTrifecta is an important milestone, but we are just getting started as our ambitions go well beyond it. We are excited by the large opportunity in front of us as we seek to take a greater share from the rapidly growing $1.9 trillion vacation market. Our plan to capitalize on this opportunity is well grounded in a set of underlying strategies, the powerful foundation of our leading global brand and a proven formula for success: moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline and the best people in the world to execute on at all.\nNow moving on to our results. The second quarter exceeded our already elevated expectations. We have seen an incredibly robust booking and pricing environment across all our key itineraries, which is not only setting us up for success in the future periods, but also contributed to the outperformance in the second quarter. This, coupled with continued strength in onboard spend, which is heavily influenced by our pre-cruise commercial engine, drove the revenue and earnings outperformance for the quarter.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered approximately 2 million vacations at exceptional guest satisfaction scores. Yields grew 13.3% compared to the second quarter of last year, which was almost 300 basis points above our guidance. The revenue outperformance combined with approximately $0.15 in favorable timing of costs resulted in an adjusted EPS that was considerably higher than our guidance. Naftali will elaborate more about second quarter details and results in a few minutes.\nThe strong demand environment is also translating into higher revenue and earnings expectations for the balance of the year. We are increasing full year yield growth expectations by 115 basis points compared to our prior guidance, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 68% year-over-year. 2024 bookings have consistently outpaced last year throughout the entire second quarter and into July despite the fact that we have significantly fewer staterooms left to sell leading to higher pricing for all key products.\nThe North American consumer who represents approximately 80% of our sourcing this year continues to be robust, driving strong yield growth across all key products. In addition to strength in the Caribbean, European and Alaska summer itineraries are performing exceptionally well, and we have experienced greater pricing power than expected since our last earnings call, leading to increased expectations for yield growth.\nOur nimble sourcing model, coupled with our brand's global appeal and leading position in their respective segments allows us to successfully capture quality demand across the segments, sourced from new and younger consumer bases and attract the highest yielding guests.\nWith such strong momentum, 2024 is on track to be another exceptional year with double-digit yield growth and significant earnings growth. We now expect full year net yield growth of 10.4% to 10.9%. Our yield outlook is driven by the performance of new and existing ships combined with our leading private destinations a strong pricing environment, continued growth from onboard revenue and are accelerating commercial apparatus.\nWe increased our revenue expectations for the second half of 2024 and now expect to deliver mid-single-digit yield growth in the back half of the year, which continues to be above our typical moderate yield growth expectations. Just as a reminder that this is on top of approximately 17% yield increase versus 2019 in the back half of 2023. We also continue to expect higher margins and higher earnings with adjusted EPS expected to be between $11.35 and $11.45 and EBITDA margins that is over 300 basis points higher than last year.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our proven formula for success, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls, which lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial return. We continue to see a very positive sentiment from our customers bolstered by a resilient economy, low unemployment, stabilizing inflation and record high household net worth.\nConsumer preference continues to shift towards spend on experiences with particularly prioritizing towards travel. Consumers have 10% more vacation days compared to 2019 and they are using half of that increase to travel. In fact, our research suggests that consumers are spending more on travel than any other leisure category and that they intend to increase their travel spend in the next 12 months.\nCruise remains an attractive value proposition and cruise purchase intent is high and continues to strengthen. Consumer financials remain healthy across demographics. The number of baby boomers reaching retirement age is expected to grow 30% to $73 million by 2030. Based on our research, retirees take 50% more vacation time than non retirees. The baby boomer generation also holds 50% of the $156 trillion of U.S. wealth, and they are expected not only to spend more on travel, but also to transfer $72 trillion of their wealth to other generations over the next 2 decades, including traveling together. We are already benefiting from that active and real-time wealth transfer through multigenerational travel across our brands.\nOur research shows that younger generations, millennials and younger, are also benefiting from the 10% increase in leisure time compared to 2019 and that they intend to allocate more of this time on travel than any other leisure category. This attractive traveler continues to gain share within our customer base at a faster pace than any other generation. And today, 1 of every 2 customers is a millennial or younger. Their travel needs and behaviors vary across trip length and type. So the differentiated experiences offered by our incredible brands resonate extremely well with these next generations of cruisers.\nOur addressable market is growing, and we are attracting more customers into our vacation ecosystem. New-to-cruise customers are up double digits versus last year, and at the same time, we are seeing stronger repeat rates. Once booked, guests are quickly engaging with us and buying significantly more onboard experiences per booking than in the second quarter of last year. Both earlier and on meaningfully higher APDs translating into higher satisfaction rates and higher onboard spend.\nPutting customers at the center of our orbit has been critical to our success and allows us to meet guests for all of life's moments, transforming the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. A key differentiator for us on this journey is our hardware, where we are constantly innovating.\nThis quarter, we took delivery of Utopia of the Seas, the ultimate weekend getaway, a shift positioned to be another game changer for our short Caribbean product. Our short Caribbean cruise product is an important entry point for new-to-cruise and new-to-brand with nearly 7 and 10 guests following in these categories and always skewing more towards younger customers.\nYounger consumers find this product particularly appealing. In fact, approximately 40% of guests who follow in this demographic have indicated that they intend to book a short vacation in the next 12 months. Moreover, 90% of guests who sail on our short product in 10 crews again with roughly half planning to return for a longer crews.\nWe also launched Silver Ray, which continues to redefine the ultra-luxury segment. Since introducing the Nova class last year, Silver Nova and Silver Ray have attracted a higher mix of younger guests than the rest of the fleet. We have an exciting lineup of new ships on order, including Celebrity Cruises, Celebrity Xcel, which launches in late 2025, and Royal Caribbean's Star of the Seas debuting in mid-2025. The third Icon class ship in 2026 and the seventh Oasis class ship in 2028z\nWe also continue to lead the vacation industry with exciting new experiences on our ships and our portfolio of private destinations. Perfect Day at CocoCay continues to perform exceptionally well, and we are reaching important milestones on Royal Beach Club Paradise Island opening in 2025 and Royal Beach Club in Cosma, Mexico opening in 2026. These new experiences uniquely position us to continue taking share from land-based alternatives.\nAs we deepen our relationship with our guests, this quarter's launch of our enterprise loyalty status match program is an important step in integrating our brands, rewarding our guests for staying within our family of brands and making travel planning even more seamless. In just 2 months since the program launched, we have seen a significant increase in enrollment across all of our brands and positive feedback from our loyal fan base.\nOnce customers book their dream vacation over 90% utilize new features and enhancement on our apps. Notably, more than 70% of guests are making precruise purchases before they fail, and they spend more than double compared to those who only make purchases on board.\nFinally, our sustainability ambitions help inform our strategic and financial decisions daily, supporting our mission to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly. We remain committed to our see the future vision, sustaining the planet, energizing communities and accelerating innovation. Our recent Maritime Decarbonization Summit onboard Utopia of the Seas underscores our commitment to reaching net 0 emissions by 2050 through industry-wide collaboration.\nMore than 30 shipowners, shipbuilders and technology and energy providers convened to catalyze advancements in necessary technological solutions and alternative fuels. We are optimistic about this important step in unifying our industry and fostering an environment for advancing quality and scalable, sustainable solutions.\nIn summary, our business continues to perform exceptionally well, and we are very pleased with our performance, achieving Trifecta early and reinstating the dividend. This sets us up well as we seek to take share from the rapidly growing $1.9 trillion vacation market. With our strong platform, our proven strategies, we are creating a lifetime medication experiences for our customers while delivering long-term shareholder value and strong financial results.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing second quarter results. Our teams delivered another strong performance that exceeded our expectations, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $3.21. The $0.51 per share outperformance compared to the midpoint of our guidance is driven by better revenue across our leading brands and across key itineraries as well as approximately $0.15 per share favorable timing of expenses.\nWe finished the second quarter with a net yield growth of 13.3%. Load factors were 108.2% and contributed approximately 300 basis points to yield growth, with the remaining increase driven by rates that were up by 10% from both new and existing hardware. OCE products had double-digit yield growth with strength in close-in demand for the Caribbean and Europe that drove the outperformance in the quarter.\nSCC excluding fuel, increased 5.7% in constant currency. The favorable cost performance compared to our guidance is driven by favorable timing of expenses that more than offset the negative impact of stock compensation given the significant appreciation of our stock price during the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 billion and gross EBITDA margin was 38%.\nAs Jason mentioned, we also achieved our Trifecta targets on a trailing 12-month basis as of the end of the second quarter. We delivered $113 adjusted EBITDA per APCD, 13% above our triple-digit target, mid-teens ROIC consistent with our target in the teens and $10.08 adjusted EPS slightly above our double-digit target. Leverage was below 3.5x when excluding the impact of new ships that were delivered midyear, and we are on track to get very close to our double-digit carbon intensity reduction target by year-end.\nOur 2024 booked position remains very strong across all products and markets and continues to outpace last year in both rate and volume. The Caribbean makes up approximately 55% of our capacity for the year and 42% for the third quarter. This product is booked ahead in both rate and volume and the strong yield growth is driven by new hardware and higher pricing on existing ships supported by our private destinations.\nEurope accounts for 15% of our capacity for the full year and 28% during the third quarter. Europe is in a record booked position in both rate and volume and continued strength in pricing, it resulted in an increase in our revenue expectations for Europe sailings. Our summer Alaska season represents 6% of full year capacity and 14% in the third quarter. We have increased our capacity this year as a result of upgrading the hardware in the market. Like Europe, we have seen strong demand since our last earnings call, leading to increased expectations for yield growth for this product.\nNow let me talk about our increased guidance expectations for 2024. Net yields are expected to be up 10.4% to 10.9% for the full year. The increase in the guidance is driven by higher pricing for both new hardware and like-for-like as well as onboard revenue. The yield cadence for the year is influenced by the load factor and pricing power catch-up in the first half. The timing of CocoCay's opening makes the comp easier for the first half of 2024. And when adjusting for such structural changes, yield growth is just about the same amount in each quarter compared to 2019.\nNow moving to costs. Full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 6%. Our cost metric is up 50 basis points compared to our prior guidance and is driven entirely by higher noncash stock-based compensation given the significant increase in the stock price since the last earnings call.\nWe have very few dry dock days in the third quarter but significantly more in the fourth quarter, which together with timing of stock compensation expense, will weigh on our cost metrics for the fourth quarter. We anticipate a fuel expense of $1.17 billion for the year, and we are 61% hedged at below market rates. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $11.35 to $11.45.\nI want to provide a little more color on the progress of our earnings guidance. We are increasing our guidance by $0.60 for the year. About half of the increase is driven by second quarter close-in demand and the other half is driven by better pricing and business outlook for the rest of the year. As I mentioned, we had about $0.15 cost timing in the second quarter, which is shifting into the back half of the year.\nNow I will discuss our third quarter guidance. We plan to operate 13.4 million APCDs during the third quarter. Net yields are expected to be up 6.5% to 7% compared to 2023, and that is on top of a 16.7% yield growth last year. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 4.7% to 5.2%. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $4.90 to $5.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in liquidity. We have been making significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet towards our goal of investment-grade metrics. Better performance and disciplined capital allocation allowed us to reduce leverage below 3.5x as of the end of the second quarter when excluding the impact of new ships that were delivered midyear, this level is within our target leverage range.\nWe plan to continue to proactively pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings to manage maturities, reduce interest expense and achieve an unsecured balance sheet. During the second quarter, we paid down the remaining balance of our debt holiday that allowed us to remove any restrictions around capital return. As you saw in the press release today, we also initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on executing on our strategy and delivering on our mission. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

Opportunity is very large and exciting as we seek to take share from the rapidly growing $1.9 trillion vacation market.\nOur formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls lead to robust financial performance and long-term shareholder value.\nBefore getting into the details, I want to recognize our incredible teams that are working together day in and day out delivering the best vacation experiences to our guests and doing so while driving exceptional results. Our business is propelled by our people, and they are the driving force behind our strategic vision for success. I'm so grateful for their commitment and passion.\nNow moving on to our results. As highlighted on Slide 4, the first quarter was tremendous, setting us well on our path to a year that is significantly better than we expected just a few months back. WAVE season, combined with a record-breaking introduction of the revolutionary Icon of the Seas resulted in consistently robust bookings at much higher prices than 2023.\nThis strong booking and pricing environment across all key itineraries, coupled with continued strength in onboard spend led to higher revenue in the first quarter and a further improvement in full year yield expectations.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered 2 million memorable vacations and achieved a 107% load factor at exceptional guest satisfaction scores. Yields grew 19.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023, almost 400 basis points above our initial guidance.\nAdjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was considerably higher than our guidance. Strong ticket and onboard revenue and favorable timing of expenses contributed to the better-than-expected earnings performance. The acceleration of demand is also translating into higher revenue and earnings expectations for the balance of the year.\nAs you can see on Page 5, we are increasing full year yield growth expectations by 50% compared to our initial guidance in early February, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 60% year-over-year. The increased outlook for the year is expected to further accelerate our trajectory towards our Trifecta goals as we continue to expect to achieve all 3 goals in 2024, 1 year earlier than initially expected.\nNow I'll provide some insight into the robust demand environment and our incredible WAVE season. Bookings consistently outpaced last year throughout the entire first quarter and through April, even though we have significantly fewer staterooms left to sell, leading to higher pricing for all of our key products. Booking strength has been prevalent on both our existing hardware as well as on our industry-leading new ships.\nWe see strong demand across all products and markets. North America continues to be extremely robust where approximately 80% of this year's guests are sourced. This strength in combination with the incredible Perfect Day at CocoCay, has resulted in strong yield growth for our Caribbean sailings.\nEuropean bookings are outpacing last year's levels at higher prices, and Alaska has been performing particularly well with the year-over-year yield growth.\nWe are also pleased to return to the high-yielding China market this month with Spectrum of the Seas and to add Ovation of the Seas to Tianjin in 2025 as we rebuild our China business. With our return to China, we are now finally back in all of our key markets, which enables us to capture quality, global demand and source from new consumer bases.\nCustomer sentiment remains very positive bolstered by resilient labor markets, wage growth, stabilizing inflation and record high household net worth.\nConsumer preferences continue to shift towards spend on experiences, particularly priority for travel. This is evident as the year-over-year growth and spend on experience is double that of spend on goods.\nDespite our ability to narrow the gap to land-based vacations in the last 12 months, cruising still remains an exceptional value proposition. We continue to see excellent engagement from customers who are booking their dream vacations with us across all our products.\nGuests are buying 10% more onboard experiences per booking than in the first quarter of last year, and they continue to book these onboard activities earlier and at meaningfully higher APDs, translating into higher onboard spend.\nLooking to the rest of 2024, the year is shaping up to be exceptional, with strong yield and earnings growth. We expect to achieve all Trifecta targets in 2024, allowing us to focus on a new era of growth to drive long-term shareholder returns. As I mentioned previously, Trifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp, but our ambitions go well beyond it.\nAs highlighted on Slide 7, we now expect to deliver net yields that are 9% to 10% higher than 2023. Our yield outlook is driven by the performance of new and existing ships combined with our leading private destinations, a strong pricing environment, continued growth from onboard revenue and our accelerating commercial apparatus.\nIn the second half of 2024, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit yield growth above our typical moderate yield growth expectations and on top of an approximately 17% yield increase in the back half of 2023. We also continue to expect the business to deliver higher margins and earnings in 2024, with adjusted earnings per share expected to grow 60% year-over-year.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our proven formula for success, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls that lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.\nOur operating platform remains a key differentiator and is bigger and stronger than ever. We remain intensely focused on attracting and keeping guests within our unique portfolio of brands and providing experiences for all of life's moments while delivering long-term value for our shareholders.\nOur addressable market is expanding and new-to-cruise continues to grow, increasing 16% year-over-year. These guests are discovering our differentiated vacation experiences and are increasingly returning to us, as we see repeat rates over 30% higher compared to 2019.\nOur brands also continue to attract new and younger customers. Millennials and younger generations have gained 11 percentage points share compared to 2019. And today, almost 1 in 2 guests are millennials or younger.\nNew hardware has been a great differentiator for us, with Icon of the Seas joining the fleet a few months ago. It is already exceeding our lofty expectations in both guest satisfaction and financial performance. We are also excited for the arrival later this year of Utopia of the Seas, a ship that is positioned to be another game changer for our short Caribbean product, and Silver Ray, which continues to reimagine the ultra-luxury and expedition segments. Demand and pricing for those new ships has been incredibly strong.\nAlso this quarter, we announced an order for a seventh ship in our hugely successful Oasis class that will join the fleet in 2028.\nOur brands continue to lead their segments and generate quality demand and we see a very large opportunity to take greater share of the rapidly growing $1.9 trillion vacation market, as we continue to grow our fleet and vacation experiences.\nWe are leading the vacation industry in creating exciting new product and experiences, which include private destinations. The newest addition to our growing portfolio of private destinations is the Royal Beach Club in Cozumel, Mexico, that is set to welcome guests in 2026. With the combination of activities for every type of vacationer, Royal Beach Club Cozumel will further enhance our guest experience, giving guests the ultimate beach day.\nEarlier this week, we also celebrated another important milestone when we officially broke ground on Royal Beach Club Paradise Island in Nassau, which is scheduled to open next year.\nOur journey to deepen the relationship with the customer continues this year. We are further enhancing our commerce platform through new technology and AI to continue improving the experience for our different distribution channels, build even more customer loyalty and lowering our cost to acquire the guests. We are removing friction and unlocking travel planning by investing in a modern digital travel platform, making it easier than ever for guests to book their dream vacations while allowing us to expand wallet share.\nOur digital experiences delight guests. Our mobile app is consistently adopted by 94% of our guests on board and we continue to enhance its capabilities. Among other features, we introduced cruise booking capabilities in the app last year and recently added the ability to book flights. We also created a loyalty hub, so customers can quickly enroll and track their loyalty tiers and benefits. We will continue to enhance those capabilities in 2024 and beyond.\nOur sustainability ambitions help support our mission to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly. We recently released our 16th annual Seastainability report which outlines the progress we are making on SEA the Future, our vision to sustain the planet, energize communities and accelerate innovation. We are actively making progress towards our journey to net zero emissions, including double-digit carbon intensity reductions and we are now beyond the halfway mark.\nAlongside the sustainability report, we published our first Community Impact report, which delves into how we energize the communities we visit. It highlights long-term projects that inspire future generations and our dedication to empowering local entrepreneurs through business development and micro grant programs like the Royal Caribbean Kickstarter in the Bahamas.\nAs we make progress, we also know achieving net zero can't be done alone. We'll need strong collaboration across the full marine ecosystem, including operators, suppliers, ports and technology providers.\nOur business continues to perform exceptionally well. I'm incredibly thankful and proud of the teams at the Royal Caribbean Group for showing up each and every day to dream and create the best vacation experiences for our guests, allowing us to perform while we transform.\nThe future of the Royal Caribbean Group is exceptionally bright, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing first quarter results, which were significantly above our expectations.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $1.77, 36% higher than the midpoint of our most recent guidance of $1.30. 45% of the outperformance or $0.21 was driven by better pricing for our vacation experiences with the remainder driven by favorable timing of operating expenses.\nWe finished the quarter with a net yield increase of 19.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023, 385 basis points higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance in early February.\nWhile our load factor recovery was a contributor, most of our yield growth was driven by rates that were up by 14% versus 2023. 55% of their outperformance compared to our initial guidance was driven by ticket pricing with the remainder driven by ship board revenue strength.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 4.1% in constant currency, 315 basis points lower than our initial guidance. Favorable timing was the driver that contributed to the better-than-expected results.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 31% and operating cash flow was $1.3 billion.\nOn our last earnings call, we discussed the record-breaking start to WAVE season and widespread strength in booking, pricing and onboard revenue. The consistent strength in demand for our brands has led to a further amplification and pricing well beyond the levels we were expecting.\nBookings have been outpacing last year by a wide margin on a weekly basis despite having less inventory remaining for sale. As a result, we continue to be in a record book volume position and our booked per [ diems ] are now even further ahead of 2023 than they were as we entered the year.\nThe Caribbean is our largest product group, representing just over 55% of our deployment this year. Overall, the Caribbean products remain in an extremely strong book position with new hardware and much higher pricing on existing ships contributing to strong yield growth for the product.\nEurope accounts for around 15% of our capacity for the full year and close to 25% during the summer. Despite the fact that we had to modify some of our Eastern Mediterranean sailings that were previously expected to [ call in ] Israel or sail through the Red Sea, our European itineraries have been performing very well. And we are currently booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume.\nRegarding the situation in the Red Sea, we have rerouted a handful of spring repositioning cruises and we also have contingency plans for a few other sailings that may be impacted in the fall. All these are included in our revised guidance this morning, including the reduction in APCDs.\nWe are all close to the start of our summer Alaska season. This product represents 6% of full year capacity and 15% in the summer season. We have upgraded our Alaska capacity this year for 2 of our brands. For the first time, Celebrity will offer incredible Alaska vacations on Edge-class ship, Celebrity Edge, and Silversea's new ship, Silver Nova, will also sail in Alaska.\nAlaska has been one of our strongest performing itineraries this year and remains in a record booked position.\nAsia Pacific itineraries will account for 10% of our capacity this year. Overall, our Asia and Australia itineraries continues to perform well, and we are in a strong book position for the upcoming winter season.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 to talk about our increased guidance expectations for 2024. Our results remain ahead of expectations, and we now expect to meet all our Trifecta goals in 2024. Net yields are expected to be up 9% to 10% for the full year, 225 basis point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance in mid-February. 40 basis points of the increase is due to exceptional first quarter results. The remainder is due to a significantly better business outlook for the rest of the year due to robust demand driving higher pricing and continued strength in onboard revenue.\nNow moving to costs. Full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 5.5%, and that includes 310 basis points impact from the increased dry dock days and the operations of Hideaway Beach.\nOur cost metric is up 150 basis points compared to our prior guidance with a 1/4 of the increase predominantly due to lower APCDs on canceled Red Sea sailings [ that skewed ] the metric. The remainder is driven by higher noncash stock-based compensation. Excluding those items, our costs are in line with our initial expectation and guidance.\nWe anticipate a fuel expense of $1.18 billion for the year, and we are 61% hedged at below market rates.\nSo based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest expense, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.70 and $10.90.\nI want to provide a little more color on the progress of our earnings guidance. As you can see on Page 5, we are increasing our earnings guidance by $0.80 for the year. That includes $0.10 headwind from fuel prices and currency exchange rates as well as $0.17 benefit from the refinancing we completed in the first quarter.\nAfter accounting for those changes, approximately 1/3 of the increase in earnings is attributable to first quarter business outperformance. That excludes $0.26 benefit from favorable timing, with the remainder 2/3 driven by better business outlook for the rest of the year.\nNow turning to Slide 8, I will discuss our second quarter guidance. We plan to operate 12.2 million APCDs during the second quarter. Net yields are expected to be up 10.2% to 10.7% compared to 2023. 2/3 of the yield increase are driven by new hardware and load factor catch-up, with the remainder 1/3 related to like-for-like pricing.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 7.4% to 7.9% and includes costs related to increased dry dock days and the operations of Hideaway Beach as well as timing of costs shifted from the first quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we will have 8.5x more dry dock days compared to the second quarter of last year. which is weighing on our cost metrics this quarter.\nTaking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $2.65 to $2.75.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in liquidity. We continue to make significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet and reaching our Trifecta goals of investment-grade metrics.\nDuring the first quarter, we refinanced $1.25 billion of our most expensive bonds with a new unsecured note at 6.25% that allowed us to save over 500 basis points or $56 million of annual interest expense while also realizing some savings in 2024. We will continue to proactively pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancing and expect to further reduce leverage to just below mid-3x by the end of 2024.\nAlso in the first quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BB+ with a stable outlook and Moody's upgraded the company's credit rating to Ba2 with a positive outlook. We are very pleased with the rating agencies' acknowledgment of the strong trajectory of the business and our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet.\nOur priorities to address debt remain unchanged, managing debt maturities, reducing interest expense and removing remaining restrictions on capital allocation and towards a fully unsecured balance sheet.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. Our strong book position and an accelerating demand environment position us for another strong year of yield growth and a step change in earnings growth.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into the details, I would like to take a moment to reflect on last week's monumental launch of our new ship, Icon of the Seas. Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that resonates so strongly and makes such a widespread impact that if forever changes the status quo. For the vacation industry, that product, Icon of the Seas debuted last week to incredible fanfare.\nOur mission at the Royal Caribbean Group is to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly and Icon is going to deliver the best family vacation on the planet with her incredible experiences and amazing crew. I'm absolutely thrilled that after years, planning and anticipation, Icon finally welcomed her first revenue guests on board this past weekend.\nWith the phenomenal guest engagement and word of mouth from this ship, along with our landmark sports partnership with InteraMiami and football Goat, look forward to making millions of vacation memories for our guests in the years ahead. A big thank you to our incredible team who worked relentlessly over 7 years, dreaming, innovating and flawlessly delivering, Icon of the Seas.\nSo now let's talk about 2023 and 2024. 2023 was an exceptional year fueled by unmatched demand for our brands, as you see on Slide 5. Net yields were up 15.5% compared to 2019, more than 3.5x our January expectations, and we delivered margins that were back to record 2019 levels. Our net income exceeded our January expectations by about $1 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share more than double our January guidance. We continued our focus on reshaping the cost structure across the operating platform, leading the durable margin expansion, which is expected to continue to provide operating leverage as we grow the business.\nInnovation is core to our company's DNA. And in 2023, we continue to direct that Innovate Spirit, not only to our new ships and destinations, but also to an amazing guest experience at all points in the vacation journey. We received exceptionally high guest satisfaction scores and attracted a record number of both new and loyal guests who are rebooking at twice the rate we were seeing in 2019. The robust performance in 2023 significantly accelerated our trajectory towards our Trifecta goals with EBITDA per APCD and ROIC on the cusp of our targets. We also continued to invest in the future while making significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet towards our targets of investment-grade metrics.\nThe year ended on an incredible note with revenue yield of nearly 18% in the fourth quarter and 2024 is in the strongest book position in the company's history, from both a pricing and volume standpoint. I'm incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well and doing so while achieving strong financial results and propelling our future growth.\nMomentum continues in 2024 with a record-breaking start to the wave season. Bookings have consistently outpaced last year across all key products at much higher rates. In fact, the 5 highest booking weeks in our company's history all occurred since the last earnings call. As a result, while our capacity is up 8.5% year-over-year, we have less inventory available to book in 2024 than we did a year ago for 2023 and half is may state rooms left in Q1.\nOur commercial apparatus is full speed ahead, and all channels are delivering quality demand above 2023 levels. Our direct-to-consumer channels continue to perform exceptionally well as consumer preferences for digital engagement and our ongoing investment and enhanced capabilities is supporting record-breaking bookings. Our travel partners are also delivering meaningfully more bookings than last year and beating our elevated expectations.\nWe continue to see particularly healthy demand from North America where about 80% of our guests will be sourced this year. Our brands, global appeal and nimble sourcing model allows us to attract the highest-yielding guests by positioning our ships in multiple markets across the world. Our brands lead in their respective segments and are very successful at capturing quality demand across sectors and sourcing from new consumer bases.\nIf you think about consumer demand for 2024 and beyond, we look to both macro trends and data points for millions of daily interactions with our customers. We continue to see a very positive sentiment from our customers bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings and elevated levels. Year-over-year growth in spend on experiences is double on goods and cruising remains an exceptional value proposition or penetration, higher consumer consideration and high purchase intent. We see an exceptionally engaged consumer base across markets, brands and products. People are looking to book their dream vacation with us and continue to spend at elevated levels.\nConsumers are engaging and booking their vacations earlier, 70% book at least one of their onboard activities pre-cruise at higher APDs and onboard spend continues at record levels and at higher rates. This positions us very well to outperform the broader travel industry and now were the pricing gap to land-based vacation. We continue to attract new customers into our vacation ecosystem and deliver the best vacation that our guests are highly satisfied and continue to rebook and return to our brands and our products.\n2024 is shaping up to be a record-breaking year with 40% earnings growth as our progress continues on an accelerated path towards achieving our Trifecta goals. As you can see in our release today, we expect to achieve several Trifecta targets in 2024, a full year earlier than previously anticipated.\nAs I said in the past, Trifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp. And while an important milestone, it is not our final destination and our ambitions go well beyond it.\nAs highlighted on Slide 6, in 2024, we expect to grow capacity by 8.5% with the introduction of Utopia of the Seas and Silver Ray in the first full year of service of the 3 incredible ships that joined our fleet during 2023. Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. New ships not only elevate our vacation experiences and draw new customers to our brands, but they also provide yield tailwinds and enhance overall profitability.\nIn 2024, we expect yields to grow 5.25% to 7.25%, driven by the performance of our entire fleet, new and existing ships combined with our leading private destinations and strong commercial apparatus. Loders and rate growth, together with continued focus on margins, and disciplined capital allocation are expected to drive record earnings that grew 40% year-over-year, getting us very close to our Trifecta targets.\nOur proven formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.\nOur operating platform is stronger than ever. We have the leading brands in their respective segments, the best people and the best and most innovative fleet and destinations. We remain focused on delivering a lifetime of vacations for our guests and a long-term value for our shareholders. We are leading the vacation industry and creating exciting new product experiences which in 2024 include game-changing ships and the expansion of our highly rated destination, Perfect Day at CocoCay. Our new ships are performing exceptionally well. And while we always expect to see strong trends when we introduce new ships. Icon of the Seas is definitely living up to her name and has taken things to a whole new level in every way.\nDemand and pricing for Icon has been incredibly strong. This we are also thrilled to take delivery of the 6 Oasis-class ships, Utopia of the Seas, which will set the stage for ultimate weekend getaway.\nLastly, we will take delivery of Silver Ray, the second ship in the evolution class, redefining ultra-luxury cruising. Silver Ray will debut in the Mediterranean this summer before transitioning to winter season in South America. New ships and their incredible innovative experiences further accelerate our efforts to steal market share from land-based vacations.\nWe completed the expansion of HideAway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay, just in time to welcome Icon on the Seas, upsizing the benefit of this strategic asset. HideAway Beach is our newest adult-only ultimate beachfront paradise at Perfect Day at CocoCay, which expands our capacity on Island to over 3 million guests annually.\nAbout 2/3 of World Caribbean International Caribbean guests will visit Perfect Day at CocoCay this year, allowing us to deliver high satisfaction scores and higher margins across the fleet.\nOur journey to deepen the relationship with the customer continues this year. We will further enhance our commercial capabilities to optimize distribution channels, build even more customer loyalty and lower acquisition costs. The outsized increase in our onboard revenue over the past couple of years has been fueled by new capabilities introduced to make it easier for guests to pre-book onboard experiences. We will continue to enhance those capabilities in 2024.\nAbout 1/3 of onboard purchases are now coming through the mobile app, and we already have about 40% of our pre-cruise revenue booked in 2024 as compared to 2023. As a reminder, customers who purchase onboard experiences before their cruise spend about 2.5x more than those who do not buy pre-cruise. We will remove friction by investing in a modern digital travel platform, making it easier than ever for guests to book their dream vacations by allowing us to expand wallet share. We will also continue driving business excellence to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. Our teams are committed to controlling costs and enhancing profitability while focusing on delivering the best guest experiences and doing so in a responsible way.\nOur sustainability ambitions held to form our strategic and financial decisions daily, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. Making progress on our see the future commitment to sustain the planet, energize communities and accelerate into. We wrapped the year on track to keep our carbon intensity reduction targets, and we are entering 2024 well beyond the halfway mark. To make this possible, we continue to accelerate innovations like the first methanol capable tri-fuel engine that we expect to debut on the celebrity Excel in 2025.\nEvery new ship represents an advancement in our energy transition efforts. The game-changing Icon of the Seas exceeds industry standards for energy efficiency by 24%. Icon and the recently launched Silver Nova also allow us to take advantage of new technologies such as innovative waste-to-energy systems on board.\nBy consistently using our latest ships to pilot new technologies, we can validate the decisions we are making now to help position us to achieve our Destination net-zero target by 2050.\nTo wrap up, the future of the Royal Caribbean Group is exceptionally bright. With our strong operating platform and proven strategies, we are creating a lifetime of vacation experiences for our customers will also deliver long-term shareholder value that allows us to reach new financial records. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2024 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by reviewing fourth quarter results. Our teams delivered yet another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, about 15% higher than the midpoint of our October guidance. All key products exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit yield growth in the fourth quarter. Net yields were up almost 18% compared to 2019, and that would have been 20%, if not for the 200 basis point drag from eliminating the reporting lag to Silversea. Load factors were at 105% and rates were approximately 19% with significant growth for both ticket and onboard revenue.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 6.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Since our last earnings call, the stock price appreciated over 50% and added 250 basis points to stock-based compensation expense versus our prior guidance. Excluding the increase in stock-based compensation, our costs came in, in line with expectations.\nOur focus on enhancing profitability allowed us to deliver 30% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter ahead of '19 levels. We also utilized excess cash flow to pay down debt and lower interest expense, consistent with our Trifecta.\n2023 was an exceptional year, as you can see on Slide 5. We generated almost $14 billion of total revenue, [ $4.5 ] billion of adjusted EBITDA and $4.4 billion of operating cash flow. Net cruise excluding fuel, increased 7.9% compared to '19. NCCx approximately 65 basis points higher costs related to increase in stock-based compensation versus our prior guidance.\nOur cost performance reflects the continued and durable benefit from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins. Our proven formula for success also drove $6.77 in adjusted earnings per share that were more than twice our initial expectations in January.\nNow switching to our 2024 outlook. I will start by taking you through capacity and deployment for the year. For the full year, our capacity is expected to be up 8.5% compared to 2023. This year, we have almost twice as many dry dock days compared to '23, reducing APCD growth by 1% and resulting in a more pronounced capacity growth in the first and third quarter. APCDs are expected to grow around [ 10% ] in the first and third quarter, 5% in the second quarter and 8% in the fourth quarter.\n2024 has consistently been in a strong booked position. And as Jason mentioned, the year is off to a very strong start with a record wave. As a result, both rates and volume are currently booked significantly ahead of the same time last year. All key products, including the Caribbean, Europe, Alaska and Australia, are mostly ahead of last year. The Caribbean represents just over 55% of our deployment this year, following a 13% increase in capacity year-over-year. The growth is due to the additions of Icon of the Seas and Utopia of the Seas combined with celebrities upsized summer program.\nSupporting this increase in capacity is the addition of HideAway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay. Our Caribbean programs are booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume. Well, bookings and pricing for Icon can only be described as iconic and Utopia is demanding significant price premiums in short Caribbean market. We are also very pleased with the trends we are seeing on existing hardware.\nEurope accounts for around 15% of our capacity following a 7% reduction year-over-year. At the time of our last earnings call, we were in the process of altering itineraries for European Mediterranean sailings that were previously expected to visit Israel, and we have since redeployed all ships with coals to Israel.\nRegarding the situation in the Red Sea, the safety of our guests and crew is a top priority, and we are constantly monitoring the situation. We only have a handful of repositioning cruises scheduled in the region this year and have already rerouted one of our Silversea ships and have contingency plans for a couple of others in the spring.\nRegarding demand for Europe product more broadly, bookings were softer for the impacted itineraries for a few weeks last October, but rebounded relatively quickly and are now significantly higher than same time last year. As a result, our European sailings are booked nicely ahead of last year.\nWe are also very pleased with the trends we are seeing on other North American itineraries. Alaska has been performing particularly well from both a rate and volume standpoint. Alaska accounts for 6% of full year capacity and 15% in the all-important season. While our capacity for Alaska is only up slightly this year, we have made exciting changes to our Alaska deployment. For the first time, celebrity will offer incredible Alaska vacations on an edge-class ship, Celebrity Ascent. And Silversea's Neareship, Silver Nova will also sale Alaska.\nAsia Pacific will account for 10% of our capacity. We are seeing strong pricing demand trends for both Asia and China as we return to China with Spectrum of the Seas in the second quarter.\nTaking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 7, you will see our guidance for 2024. This will be the second full year on our path towards our Trifecta goals, and our results remain ahead of track. Net yields are expected to be up 5.25% to 7.25%, and that's following an exceptional 2023 that saw double-digit yield growth that only accelerated as the year progressed. While the 2023 comparable set a high bar, full year yield growth is being fueled by our incredible new hardware, higher load factors, higher pricing, the expansion of Perfect Day at CocoCay and further advancements in our commercial capabilities.\nNow moving to costs. Our focus remains to enhance margins as we continue to grow the business. Full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 3.75% to 4.25% to approximately 315 basis points impact from increased dry dock days and the operations of HideAway Beach. The majority of our dry docks are in late first quarter and early second quarter, which will mostly weigh on our first half costs. The remaining dry docks will be in the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate a fuel expense of $1.16 billion for the year, and we are 61% hedged at below market rates. This year, we'll also see introduction of the EU and scheme, which will apply to 40% of our European itineraries related emissions, and we do not expect this to significantly weigh on earnings. Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest expense, we expect a record adjusted earnings per share of $9.50 and $9.70.\nturning first quarter guidance as summarized on Slide 8. In the first quarter, about 73% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 18% in Asia Pacific, and the remaining capacity is spread across a number of other itineraries, including South America and Expedition Cruises. Book load factors and rates are at record levels and are both up significantly versus same time last year.\nAs you can see from our guidance, we expect significant yield growth for the first quarter, driven by full load factor recovery and the annualization of the strong pricing trends, which began at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 15% for the first quarter with both Caribbean and Australian itineraries driving the growth out.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 7.1% to 7.6%, and include 380 basis points impact from increased dry docks and costs related to opening HideAway Beach. We also have approximately 200 basis points of in the first quarter related to the start-up of Icon as well as higher load factors as compared to Q1 2023. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $1.10 to $1.20.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit facilities and term loan and repaid the remaining $500 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes. We settled our 2.875% convertible notes in November by utilizing $225 million of cash and issuing just under 147,000 shares. We made significant progress during 2023, strengthening the balance sheet towards our Trifecta goal of investment-grade metrics. Better performance and disciplined capital allocation allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage to around 4x total debt to adjusted EBITDA at year-end when excluding the impact of new ships that were delivered mid-year.\nWe will continue to proactively pay down debt and pursue stick refinancings and expect to further reduce leverage to close to mid-3x by the end of [ 2024 ]. Our priorities to address debt remain unchanged, managing debt maturities, reducing interest expense and remaining restriction on capital allocation and towards a fully unsecured balance sheet.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. Trifecta created a pathway back to base camp. And while an important milestone is not our final destination as our ambitions go well beyond it. The combination of our book position and an accelerating demand environment is certainly pointing to another strong year of yield growth and a step change in earnings growth.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group Third Quarter 2023 and Business Update Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael McCarthy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McCarthy, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our Investor Relations website and in our earnings release. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our third quarter and an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin today, I would like to first acknowledge the devastating events taking place in the Middle East. The horrific terrorist attacks on Israel over two weeks ago have no place in a civilized society. The scale and the barbarity of those attacks should shock us all and brings the situation in the Middle East to a very dangerous low.\nWe are heart broken at the loss of so many innocent lives then and in the war that continues this day. Our thoughts are with all who have been impacted, including many members of our own team.\nI would also like to recognize the incredible effort from our shoreside teams and crew, aboard Rhapsody of the Seas, who have been working tirelessly with the U.S. Department of State to help safely evacuate Americans from Israel. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to all involved.\nAs it relates to the impact of these events on our business, about 1.5% of our capacity in the fourth quarter had planned to visit Israel. Most of the impacted deployment was quickly adjusted, including a few sailings that were home porting and Haifa. The evacuation services of Rhapsody of the Seas were provided pro bono to the U.S. government and these costs are included in our financial forecasts. Combined with canceled and adjusted itineraries in the region for the remainder of the year, the impact amounts to about $0.05 in earnings per share.\nNow moving on to the business. Our teams have done an outstanding job delivering on another strong quarter as we delivered a yield improvement of close to 17% and beat the midpoint of our EPS guidance by 12%. This beat is further solidifying 2023 as a banner year in positioning us extremely well for 2024 and beyond. I want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team whose enthusiasm and dedication enables us to deliver the very best vacation experiences responsibly while generating strong financial results.\nDuring the third quarter, all key itineraries exceeded our already elevated expectations as we delivered a record 2 million memorable vacations and exceptional guest satisfaction scores. As you can see on Slide 3, we had record yields for the quarter driven by new hardware, record pricing in the Caribbean and Europe as well as onboard revenue rates that were up about 30%.\nWhile the performance of our Caribbean itineraries has been excellent throughout the year, we were particularly pleased with the double-digit yield growth achieved on our European itineraries in the third quarter. As we look to the full year, the strong performance in the third quarter and continued acceleration in the booking environment is positioning us well to deliver over 13% yield growth for the year and earnings per share that is twice our original guidance for the year.\nThe unprecedented acceleration in demand and pricing for our leading brands, combined with stronger demand for onboard experiences were certainly the main drivers of our outperformance. Adding to that, our strong focus on cost has been an important contributing factor to our elevated 2023 results. The healthy demand environment is very encouraging as we continue to build the business for 2024 and beyond.\nA year ago, we announced a 3-year financial performance program, Trifecta. Our teams have rallied around to Trifecta targets, focusing on generating strong quality demand enhancing margins, building for the future and most of all, delivering the best vacations in the world.\nAs you can see from our results, we are well on our way to achieving Trifecta. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, although I would not describe this year as moderate, and strong cost controls lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.\nAs I've said in the past, Trifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp. However, base camp is not our final destination, and our ambitions go well beyond it. As we think about 2024 for the Royal Caribbean Group from a consumer demand standpoint, we look to both macro trends and data points from the millions of daily customer interactions.\nOn a macro level, some of the economic indicators continue to provide some conflicting signals. However, when we look closer at these trends, and indicators related to our customers and their related behaviors and strong propensity to cruise, we see that many of these macro indicators are less relevant to our business.\nWe have more than 130,000 guests sailing on our ships every day and millions more who book or engage with us throughout our commercial platforms. What we continue to see across all markets, brands and products is an exceptionally engaged consumer that is looking to book their dream vacations with us. The positioning of our brands attract guests across broad demographics, psychographics and at a median household income of at least $125,000.\nOur customers' sentiment is bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings and elevated wealth levels. Even better for us is the fact that overall spend on experiences continue to grow and is currently up 25% compared to 2019, with twice the amount spent on goods.\nCruising remains an exceptional value proposition with strong demographics and secular tailwinds, allowing us to outperform the broader leisure travel industry. Our goal is to further narrow the gap to land-based vacations as we attract even more satisfied customers to our vacation ecosystem. I believe that is why when people are raising concerns in other industries like hotel, airline, real estate. Our commercial apparatus is firing on all cylinders with visits to our websites in the third quarter, doubling that of 2019.\nOur travel partners are also delivering meaningfully more bookings than 2019 levels and even beating our elevated expectations. Our brand's global appeal and nimble sourcing model allows us to attract the highest yielding guests and partially mitigate the impact from the stronger dollar. Now I'll focus on 2024, which is shaping up to be another incredible year for the Royal Caribbean Group.\nOur capacity is growing by 8% and our deployment across markets is relatively consistent with 2023 with slightly more Caribbean, slightly less Europe and a return to China for the first time in 4 years. Demand for 2024 has continued to accelerate with bookings consistently outpacing 2019 levels by a wide margin. This has resulted in a booked position that is ahead of all prior years at higher rates further positioning us for another year of strong yield and earnings growth.\nWhile still early, we anticipate making significant progress towards our trifecta goals in 2024. And based on current fuel FX and interest rates, we anticipate earnings that will start with at least a $9 handle.\nOur operating platform is larger and stronger than it has ever been with the best brands, the most innovative fleet and destinations and the best people. Each of our brand is the leader within their category. Royal Caribbean International dominates the contemporary market Celebrity Cruises has redefined the premium travel space and no one delivers ultra-luxury and expedition at sea like Silversea.\nBy combining their unique strengths, we have created an attractive vacation ecosystem in which the sum is greater than the parts. Essentially, we are turning our delivery of a vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. We will continue to ensure that each brand has what it needs to continue doing what it does best, while leveraging our enhanced commercial capabilities to capture and keep customers in our ecosystem. From young families to empty nesters as they seek to return to us time and time again for the best vacation experiences. Our innovative new ships and onboard experiences allow us to continue to differentiate our offerings as well as deliver superior yields and margins.\nIn August, we welcomed Silver Nova, the first of the new evolution class for our Silversea brand. In the next few weeks, Celebrity Cruises will take delivery of Celebrity Ascent. And Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of the game-changing Icon of the seas later this quarter with revenue sailings beginning at the end of January.\nIn 2024, we plan to take delivery of Utopia of the Seas for Royal Caribbean International and Silver Ray for Silversea. With each new ship, we raised the bar in the travel industry while enhancing what our guests already know and love.\nAlso debuting in January 2024, just in time for the arrival of Icon of the Seas is Hideaway Beach. Hideaway Beach is our newest adult-only ultimate beachfront Paradise at Perfect Day at CocoCay. Pre-crude sales for Hideaway Beach and premium offerings are exceeding our expectations. We are further enhancing our commerce capabilities to optimize our distribution channels, build even more customer loyalty and lower our acquisition costs.\nWe have seen a significant increase in new to brand and new-to-cruise customers this year. In fact, in the third quarter, approximately 2/3 of our guests were new to cruise or new to brand, all while also doubling the repeat booking rate, indicating strong loyalty and satisfaction. We've continued to remove friction and make it easier than ever for guests to prebook their activities with about 1/3 of those purchases now coming through the mobile app.\nIn the third quarter, about 70% of guests made pre-cruise purchases at much higher APDs than in prior years. In the third quarter, customers who purchased onboard experiences before their crews spend 2.5x more than those who only bought once on board.\nAs we look into 2024, we have booked over double the amount of pre-cruise revenue compared to this year with more guests engaging before their crews and at higher prices. We will continue to excel in the core and drive business excellence in order to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform.\nI said it before, but it's worth mentioning again, our formula for success remains unchanged. We moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls will lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance. Our sustainability ambitions help inform our strategic and financial decisions on a daily basis, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. We are making progress on our SEA the future commitments to sustain the planet, energize communities and accelerate innovation.\nWe are also progressing towards a double-digit reduction in carbon intensity versus 2019 by 2025 and are exploring multiple options for low carbon-based solutions for our existing fleet while we design the fleet of the future with flexibility in mind.\nThis past quarter, we concluded a 12-week biofuel trial program in Europe, a first in the industry to cover multiple fuel types in multiple operating areas. The trials resulted in a 20% carbon reduction while also helping to better understand supply chain dynamics. The decision that we are making now will help position us to deliver a net zero ship by 2035 and achieve our climate strategy of Destination Net Zero.\nOur business is performing exceptionally well, and we are making significant progress towards achieving Trifecta goals. The future of the Royal Caribbean Group is bright with our strong platform and proven strategies, we are creating a lifetime of vacation experiences for our customers while also delivering long-term shareholder value that allows us to reach new financial records. With that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naft?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with third quarter results. Our teams delivered another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $3.85, 12% higher than the midpoint of our July guidance. We finished the third quarter with a load factor of 110% and with net yields, they were up almost 17% versus 2019, about 300 basis points higher than the midpoint of our July guidance. Overall, about 50% of the better-than-expected yield performance was driven by European itineraries with the remainder mainly driven by Caribbean and Alaska.\nRates were up approximately 18% in the third quarter compared to '19 and onboard APDs have been consistently higher even as load factors return to historical levels.\nNCC, excluding fuel, increased 10.3% compared to the third quarter of 2019, 100 basis points lower than our July guidance. Lower operating costs as well as favorable timing contributed to the better-than-expected costs. Our teams continue to deliver strong top line growth while maintaining focus on costs to expand our margin.\nWe delivered an EBITDA margin of nearly 42% in the third quarter, on par with 2019 levels. Over 100% of the revenue outperformance during the quarter dropped to the [ broad ] bottom line, leading to higher adjusted EBITDA and earnings versus expectations.\nWe continue to see strong demand and pricing for both 2023 and 2024 sailings. This has resulted in higher-than-expected load factors and record yields in the third quarter, along with a record booked position on a forward-looking basis. Now that we are in the fourth quarter, many of our ships have transitioned from their summer to their winter itineraries.\nIn the fourth quarter, about 55% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 11% in Europe and about 13% in the Asia Pacific region. The remaining capacity is spread across a number of other itineraries, including repositionings, South America and Expedition Cruises. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about our guidance for the full year 2023.\nWe now expect net yield growth of 12.9% to 13.4% for the full year, a 140 basis point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 7% to 7.5% for the full year as compared to '19.\nOur cost outlook has not changed from our July guidance. We do, however, have slightly fewer APCDs due to the canceled sailings that included Israel impacting NCC x by approximately 30 basis points. Our cost outlook reflects the continued benefit from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins.\nWe continue to expect record adjusted EBITDA per APCD for the year and an EBITDA margin that is back to our previous record in 2019. So in summary, we expect adjusted earnings per share of [ $6.68 to $6.63 ] and it includes approximately $0.21 negative impact from FX and fuel rates as well as sailings that included Israel. Now turning to Slide 7 I will discuss our fourth quarter guidance.\nFourth quarter yields are expected to be up approximately 16.2% to 16.7%, driven by our incredible new hardware and a significant increase in rates, both ticket and chipboard for like-for-like ships. This range also includes about 200 basis points negative impact from the elimination of the reporting lag related to Silversea.\nNCC, excluding fuel, is expected to be up 3.9% to 4.4% and including 60 basis points impact from sailings that included Israel related to reduced APCDs. As for adjusted earnings per share, we expect a range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the fourth quarter. This also includes $0.18 negative impact from FX and fuel rates as well as sailings that included Israel. Now I will share insights for 2024, which while still early, is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company.\n2024 capacity is expected to be up 8% as we introduce Icon, Utopia and Silver Ray and benefit from a full year of Ascent and Silver Nova. Capacity growth is most pronounced in the first and the third quarters due to the timing of new ship deliveries and timing of dry docks. Our Caribbean capacity is growing about 13% in 2024 and will represent about 55% of overall deployment.\nWe are adding a full year of Icon of disease and about 7 months of short Caribbean sailings on Utopia. We also expect to increase the number of guests experiencing Perfect Day CocoCay with the addition of Hideaway Beach. As a result, we expect a total of 3 million guests will experience Perfect Day in 2024, up from 2.5 million this year.\nEuropean itineraries will account for 15% of our capacity in 2024. Alaska will account for about 6% and Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 10%, marking our return to China with spectrum of disease in Q2 of next year. Capacity for itineraries to visit Israel account for less than 1.5% in 2024. As Jason mentioned, both our booked load factors and APDs are higher than all previous years. This is despite having more short Caribbean itineraries in China, which typically book closer in.\nThere are a few factors that are expected to influence the cadence of our yield growth throughout 2024. In addition to the typical variability driven by the timing of new ship deliveries, the return to normal load factors in the first half of the year will bolster our year-over-year yield growth in comparison to the back half. The first quarter will also benefit from the annualization of pricing power that accelerated during [ wave ] this year.\nNow moving to costs. Our focus remains to control costs as we seek to grow our revenue and margins. We also continue to benefit from all the actions that we have taken in the last few years to reshape our cost structure. In 2024, we expect to have double the dry dock days compared to this year because of timing of drydocks throughout the pandemic.\nIn addition, we are launching Hideaway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay that while it is accretive to margin, has no APCDs associated with it, further impacting cost comparisons. We expect the increased dry dock days and the opening of Hideaway Beach to negatively impact [ NCC x ] by approximately 300 basis points next year.\nOutside of that, we expect cost to increase very low single digits, consistent with our proven formula. We will provide more details on the financial impact of these items during our fourth quarter earnings call. The combination of our strong book position and an accelerating demand environment is certainly pointing to another year of solid yield growth and a step change in earnings growth as we accelerate towards our Trifecta goals.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in liquidity. Strengthening the balance sheet continues to be a top priority. Better-than-expected cash flow generation and our disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage and debt levels with the goal of achieving investment-grade balance sheet metrics.\nUtilizing cash flow from operations, we repaid $775 million of debt during the quarter, including $500 million of our [ 11.5% ] senior secured notes due June 2025.\nIn October, we refinanced our $3 billion revolving credit facility and $500 million term loan into a new $3.5 billion multiyear revolving credit facility. The successful execution of the new credit facility demonstrates the continued support and confidence in the company's financial position and credit improvement.\nAlso in October, we issued a redemption notice for the remaining $500 million of our [ 11.5% ] secured notes due June 2025. This redemption will be funded with existing liquidity. With that, we expect to pay off over $3.5 billion of debt and reduce leverage to mid 4x by the end of the year. Debt paydown actions reduced interest expense by close to $100 million in 2023 compared to our initial expectations and contribute to further increase in earnings going forward as we chip away at our high-cost debt.\nOur commitment to strengthening the balance sheet is also being recognized by the credit agencies. In the third quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating by 2 notches to BB- and Moody's upgraded our credit rating by 1 notch to be 1 with a positive outlook. As the business accelerates and generates more cash flow, we'll continue to proactively and methodically pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings in support of our Trifecta goals.\nIn closing, we remain committed and focused on executing on our strategy and delivering our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group Second Quarter 2023 and Business Update Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael McCarthy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McCarthy, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bailey, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our website and in our earnings release available at www.rclinvestor.com. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis. Jason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our second quarter and an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to share with you this morning our strong second quarter results and another step change in the trajectory of our business. You may recall that we doubled our revenue yield guidance and increased our earnings expectations by 40% in May on the heels of a record wave period that drove strong booking momentum for our brands.\nWell, as we shared in this morning's press release, it got even better since then. The combination of strong preference for our leading brands, numerous consumer tailwinds and the attractive value proposition of cruise contributed to strong and accelerated demand for our vacation experiences.\nOur brands continue to excel, and we not only delivered another outstanding quarter that significantly exceeded expectations, but are also increasing our full year earnings guidance by another 33%. I'm thrilled to share that we are now expecting double-digit yield growth for the full year and low teens growth rate for the remaining quarters.\nI want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team for delivering another outstanding quarter. Their passion, dedication and commitment allow us to deliver the very best vacation experiences responsibly while generating strong financial results.\nLast year, we laid out Trifecta, which set clear and ambitious targets. We have made tremendous progress towards those goals and now expect to achieve record EBITDA per APCD and record return on invested capital this year. We are well on our way to achieving Trifecta as we continue to execute on our strategies.\nAs highlighted on Slide 3, we delivered another outstanding quarter that exceeded expectations. The robust demand environment we reported back in May continued throughout the second quarter and translated into strong booking volumes and meaningfully higher prices.\nDuring the second quarter, we delivered a record 1.9 million memorable vacations and exceptional guest satisfaction scores. We achieved record yields that were 12.9% higher in 2019, strong close-in demand, higher pricing and continued strength of onboard spend drove the revenue outperformance.\nWhile the Caribbean remains a standout performer this year, we were particularly pleased with the strength and quality of closing demand for European itineraries. This acceleration of demand for Europe contributed to the better-than-expected yield performance for the quarter.\nOur continued focus on enhancing margins and our disciplined capital allocation resulted in more than 100% of the revenue outperformance flowing to the bottom line. We had record adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter and achieved significantly better-than-expected earnings.\nBooking volume since our last earnings call have continued to accelerate, both for 2023 sailings and even more so for 2024 as the majority of the bookings we are currently taking are for next year's sailings.\nThe North American consumer remains incredibly strong, and volumes from European consumers looking to book their summer vacations accelerated. The strength of our brands and quality of our vacation experiences combined with the value proposition of cruise is translating into double-digit yield growth expectations versus 2019 for the year and low teens growth rate for the second half of 2023. Our load factors are now back to normal. So the incredible yield growth is driven by strength in pricing and onboard spend for both new and like-for-like hardware.\nWhile it's still too early to provide any specific color for next year's outlook, clearly, the very healthy demand environment we are seeing is quite encouraging. There has been a lot of talk about the state of the consumer, and I want to share what we are seeing for millions of daily interactions with our customers.\nSentiment remains strong and is bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages and excess savings. Our customers remain engaged and eager to vacation and build memories with us as they continue to shift preferences towards experiences over goods.\nOver the last few months, experience spend was up 25% compared to 2019 and double that of spend on goods. Despite this increase, spend on experiences remains lower than the long-term trend line, implying a multiyear catch-up opportunity. Our vacation platform is appealing to a broad range of vacationers and our addressable market continues to expand as we benefit from favorable demographics and wealth trends.\nIn the second quarter, the percent of guests were either new to brand or new to cruise surpassed 2019 levels by a wide margin, and we have seen post-cruise repeat booking rates nearly double 2019 levels. While we have made positive strides in narrowing the gap to land-based vacations over the last several months, cruising remains an exceptional value proposition, allowing us to outperform broader leisure travel as we seek to further close the gap to land-based vacations, drive better revenue and welcome even more happy customers.\nFuture cruise consideration is near all-time highs and a contributing factor to a doubling in website visits compared to 2019. In addition, our travel partners are now fully back up and running and delivering more bookings than they did in 2019.\nOur improved commercial capabilities have allowed us to capture this quality demand and expand our share of the guest wallet. In the second quarter, about 2/3 of our guests booked some of their onboard activities in advance of their cruise translating into incremental spend once on board. While we have made a significant leap, we are still in the early innings of our journey, and we continue to add new features and capabilities to our app in commercial engines.\nOne thing is clear. Our guests continued to spend more on their vacation experience and our teams continue to deliver strong guest satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores. The robust demand we see for our products is bolstered by our industry-leading brands, innovative hardware, enhanced destination offerings, nimble global sourcing model and strong execution by our teams.\nNew hardware has been a great differentiator for us, allowing us to drive quality demand and attract new customers into our vacation ecosystem. In 2023, we take delivery of 3 new ships that support our strategy and will deliver premium yields in 2024 and beyond. This month, Silversea welcomed Silver Nova, the first of the new Evolution class. Later this year, Celebrity Cruises will welcome Celebrity Ascent and Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of the game-changing Icon on the Seas late in Q4 with its revenue sailings beginning in the end of January.\nLooking ahead into 2024, Royal Caribbean International has recently revealed the ultimate weekend getaway, Utopia of the Seas, which will join our fleet mid next year. Utopia will be the first Oasis-class ship that will be entirely focused on short cruises in the Caribbean, supporting our strategy of competing with land-based vacation alternatives and driving new-to-cruise customers into our vacation ecosystem as we seek to close the value gap.\nDemand and pricing for Utopia has far exceeded our expectations. Also, in 2024, Silversea will welcome the second in the evolution class, Silveray, delivering the future of ultra-luxury cruising. Demand for Ray is very strong, and it is attracting the highest rates for the brand's Classic fleet.\nWe continue our efforts to deepen the relationship with the customer. We are further enhancing our commerce capabilities to optimize our distribution channels build even more customer loyalty and lower our acquisition costs. We continue to enhance our e-commerce and precruise capabilities and are seeing increased guest repeat rates and spend as well as further elevation in the overall guest experience.\nWe will continue to excel in the core and drive business excellence in order to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost control will lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.\nIn conclusion, our business and our amazing team on and off the water are firing on all cylinders as we exceeded expectations in the second quarter, and significantly increased our earnings and cash flow guidance for 2023. We are well on our way to achieving our trifecta goals. Our differentiated platform that includes the best brands, fleet, destination, people and global sourcing platform is winning. And I'm very proud of our teams that go out every day to deliver the best vacations responsibly. And with that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by discussing our results for the second quarter. We delivered another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.82, 17% higher than the midpoint of our May guidance.\nWe finished the second quarter with a load factor of 105% and with net yields that were up 12.9% versus 2019, about 260 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, about half of the yield growth was driven by new hardware and half driven by a significant increase in rates on like-for-like hardware despite being a bit behind on load factors.\nRates were up 17% in the second quarter compared to 2019. NCC, excluding fuel per APCD increased 9% compared to the second quarter of 2019. While our costs came in consistent with our May guidance, the increase in our share price and the significant increase in our financial outlook for the year resulted in higher stock-based compensation.\nThis cost, which contributed 220 basis points to the quarter was offset by favorable timing that will shift into the third quarter. Our operational and commercial teams are doing an exceptional job driving strong top line growth and maintaining focus on operating expenses to expand margins.\nOur EBITDA margin in the second quarter has recovered to its 2019 levels and over 100% of the revenue outperformance during this quarter dropped to the bottom line, leading to significant earnings beat versus our guidance. As Jason mentioned, booking volumes since our last earnings call significantly exceeded 2019 for both North American and European consumers.\nCaribbean itineraries account for about 55% of our full year capacity and about 37% in the third quarter. Strong demand for Caribbean itineraries contributed to the strong performance in the second quarter and is one of the key drivers of the increase in expectations for the full year.\nEurope sailings account for 17% of our full year capacity and 35% in the third quarter. The acceleration in demand is resulting in an increase in our revenue expectations for Europe sailings. The better-than-expected performance has mostly been driven by our European customers, which underscores our nimble and global sourcing model.\nAlaska only accounts for 6% of our full year capacity, but represents 16% in the third quarter. We have added 3 additional ships to the region with capacity up about 60% versus 2019 for this high-yielding product. Similar to the Caribbean, we have seen very strong volume trends for Alaska sailings and load factors have been above 2019 since early this year and in line with our expectations.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about increased guidance expectations for the full year 2023. We now expect net yield growth of 11.5% to 12% for the full year about 450 basis point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. About 15% of the increase is driven by the strong second quarter results with the remainder due to a significantly better business outlook for the rest of the year.\nThe further increase in yield expectations for the year is the result of higher pricing and further strength in onboard revenue. Both new and like-for-like hardware are driving higher pricing for our core products. Yields for both remaining quarters are expected to be up in the low teens, with third quarter yields up 13.75% at the midpoint of our guidance range and an acceleration throughout the year.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 7% for the full year as compared to 2019. Our cost outlook reflects the continued benefit from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins. As I mentioned before, the increase in full year 2023 costs is mainly a result of increase in stock compensation expense. We also recently announced our return to China in spring of 2024. In anticipation of this return, we plan to increase our cost in support of the restart.\nAs I noted on the last earnings call, full year net cruise costs also include 210 basis points of structural cost that we did not have in 2019 and mostly related to operations of CocoCay and our Galveston terminal. Our team's focus on delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly while enhancing profitability is translating to the bottom line.\nFor the second half of the year, 90% of the increase in revenue expectation flows through to earnings and increases our margin. We also expect record EBITDA per APCD for the year and an EBITDA margin that is an eyelash away from our previous record in 2019.\nSo in summary, based on the current business outlook, along with current fuel pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $6 to $6.20. Now turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our third quarter guidance. Net yields are expected to be up 13.5% to 14% compared to 2019. Exceptional strength in Caribbean itineraries and accelerating demand for Europe itineraries is driving the increase in yields.\nNCC, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 11.2%. About half of the cost increase compared to 2019 relates to structural costs timing shift of operating expenses from the second quarter and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nMany factors contribute to variability in cost growth within quarters, and our focus is on full year cost management. With that said, we expect costs in the second half to normalize to the yearly average with fourth quarter benefiting from a more favorable comparable mainly due to increased dry dock days in 2019.\nSo in summary, based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.38 to $3.48 for the third quarter. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in liquidity and generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow during the second quarter.\nOur liquidity remains very strong and strengthening the sheet continues to be a top priority, better-than-expected cash flow generation and our disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage and debt levels with the goal of achieving investment-grade balance sheet metrics. Utilizing cash flow from operations, we repaid $1.6 billion of debt during the quarter, including $392 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes due June 2025.\nAlso during the quarter, we settled the 4.25% convertible notes that were due in June with $337 million of cash and 370,000 shares. Then in July, we redeemed an additional $300 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes due June 2025. As a result, we only have $700 million of those notes currently outstanding. That paydown actions will reduce interest expense in 2023 and beyond and contribute to further increase in earnings as we chip away at our high-cost debt.\nAs for leverage, this year, we will have $3.2 billion of debt related to new ship deliveries that are contributing minimal to no EBITDA in 2023. when excluding this debt from the calculation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the mid 4x by the end of the year, a significant progress toward our goal of achieving investment-grade balance sheet metrics.\nAs our business accelerates and generates more cash flow, we will continue to proactively and methodically pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings in support of our trifecta goals. In closing, our business continues to accelerate, and we remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our mission while achieving our effective goals. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings and Business Update Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael McCarthy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2023 Business Update Conference Call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our website and in our earnings release available at www.rcl Investor com.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our first quarter and an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to be here this morning to share our incredible first quarter results and the strong trajectory of our business. When we turn the page from 2022 into 2023 with the full strength of our operating platform deployed and numerous tailwinds related to the consumers' desire to travel and experience the world, we believe this would be a great year. We expect it to finally return to yield growth in the first quarter and accelerate even more through the rest of the year.\nWell, as you saw in the press release this morning, what transpired over the past 4 months was much better than we had anticipated. Our brands are stronger than ever and our yield in Q1 blew away previous records. Before getting into the detail, I want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team, 100,000 plus strong for another outstanding quarter. Their dedication and commitment allow us to deliver the very best vacation experiences responsibly while generating strong financial results.\nAs highlighted on Slide 4, it has been a tremendous first quarter that set us well on the path to a year that is significantly better than we expected just a few months back. We knew that demand for our business was strong. what has transpired was a record-breaking extended wave season that translated into robust bookings and meaningfully better prices. In the first quarter, we delivered a record 1.9 million memorable vacations, achieved 102% load factor at higher pricing than 2019 and earned exceptional guest satisfaction scores. Yields grew 5.8% compared to record 2019 levels, and were significantly above our guidance. Strong demand for Caribbean itineraries translated into higher load factors had better-than-expected pricing for both ticket and onboard. Our yields are now exceeding record highs, and we expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year and beyond. This is particularly significant because while we thought the first quarter would be a transition period, we always expected the rest of the year to be strong. The fact that demand for the coming 9 months is so much stronger than our already robust expectations says a lot about the strength of the consumer and the strength of our brands.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in the first quarter were both considerably higher than our guidance, and we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. Strong revenues, our continued focus on increasing margins and favorable timing of operating expenses contributed to the better-than-expected earnings performance. The acceleration of demand, coupled with our team's incredible execution is also translating into higher revenue and earnings expectations for the full year. As you can see on Page 5, we are more than doubling our full year yield growth expectations to 6.75% to 7.25% on increased expectations for ticket and onboard revenues. We are also increasing earnings per share expectations by 40% to $4.40, to $4.80 as we continue to focus on expanding margins as revenue accelerates.\nNow I'll provide some insight into the robust demand environment and our incredible wave season. Bookings outpaced 2019 levels by a very wide margin throughout the entire first quarter and into April. Pricing was also significantly higher as our commercial apparatus across all channels has been driving quality demand into our vacation ecosystem. The strong wave season resulted in an acceleration of our book position in relation to prior years. The booking window is now completely back to normal, demonstrating consumers' desire to continue to plan their vacation travel with us well in advance. While demand has been strong across all products and markets, we continue to see exceptional strength from the North American consumer. This strength in combination with the incredible, Perfect Day at CocoCay has resulted in record yields for our Caribbean sailings. In addition, European bookings are nicely outpacing 2019 levels with peak summer sailings trending particularly well in recent weeks. The robust demand we see for our products as a result of our superior brands, hardware, enhanced destination offerings, a nimble and global sourcing model and strong execution by our teams.\nAs you heard me say on prior earnings calls, we continue to see financially healthy and engage consumers [ are ] eager to vacation and build memories with us. Our customer sentiment remains strong and is bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages and excess savings. Secular tailwinds continue to benefit us as consumers continue to shift preferences and spend from goods to experiences, resulting in a strong entertainment and travel spend. This trend continued in the first quarter where spend on experience was 24% higher than 2019 and double the spend on goods. Further, our research shows that consumers plan to continue prioritizing leisure travel over other spend. Our addressable market is plentiful and continues to be meaningfully larger than it was in 2019. Our product appeals to a broad range of vacationers who are seeking everything from a short getaway to a Perfect Day to a luxury world cruise.\nCruising remains an exceptional value proposition. I would actually say it's too attractive of a value proposition, which is allowing us to outperform broader leisure travel as we seek to close the gap to land-based vacations and drive better revenue and happy customers. Cruise search is up 15% versus 2019, significantly outpacing the growth in general vacation search and contributing to the doubling of visitors to our website when compared to 2019. Our vacations are popular among a broad range of consumers, which allows us to attract more and more new customers into our ecosystem. In the first quarter, the percentage of guests, who are either new to brand or new to cruise, surpassed 2019 levels by a wide margin. The improvements we have made in our commercial capabilities have allowed us to capture quality demand and expand our share of guest wallet.\nIn the first quarter, about 2/3 of our guests booked some of their onboard activities in advance of their cruise. The comparable figure in 2019 was 48% and -- so you can see we have used our time well to upgrade our systems. Every dollar of guest spends pre-cruise translates into approximately $0.70 of incremental spend once on board. While we have made a significant leap in our commercial capabilities, we are still in the early innings of our journey, and we'll continue to add features and capabilities to our app and commercial engines.\nLooking to the rest of 2023, we expect to deliver amazing vacation experiences to over 8 million guests a record yields as we deploy our best-in-class fleet across the best global itineraries. We expect to return to historical load factors in late spring and continue to benefit from a strong pricing environment. We expect to deliver record yields that are 6.75% to 7.75% higher than 2019 with every one of our brands generating positive direct profit this year. Our strong yield growth outlook is driven by the performance of new hardware, a strong pricing environment, especially for Caribbean itineraries and continued growth from onboard revenue areas. New hardware has been a great differentiator for us, and we are benefiting from the 8 ships that joined our fleet since 2019. This year, each of our wholly owned brands will welcome a new vessel. These ships are sure to continue elevating vacation experiences for our guests and will continue to further drive the competitive advantage and deliver very attractive financial returns. Since all 3 of these ships will be delivered in the second half of this year, they will be a key yield driver next year.\nSilversea will welcome Silver Nova this summer, the first of the new evolution class. Celebrity cruises will welcome the fourth in the award-winning Edge series, and Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of the game-changing icon of the seas. Let me spend a minute talking about Icon of the Seas and the excitement she is generating with our customers. With Icon, we set out to create the ultimate vacation for thrill seekers, the chill enthusiasts and everyone in between without compromise. She is getting exceptional demand with bookings well surpassing previous records. Despite being on sale for only 5 months, Icon is significantly more booked for her inaugural season at materially higher rates than any other Royal Caribbean ship launch. Icon will join the fleet later this year and will debut in the Caribbean in January 2024, with itineraries that include Perfect Day at CocoCay and its new expansion, Hideaway Beach.\nMoving to costs. Our team have been working hard for several years to reshape our cost structure with the goal of enhancing margins. Our cost outlook for the year reflects our commitment to enhancing profitability while focusing on delivering the best vacation experiences. We continue to expect the business to deliver a record yield and adjusted EBITDA in 2023. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, though I wouldn't define this year's growth as moderate and strong cost controls will lead to enhanced margins profitability and superior financial performance. We just published our 15th Annual [ Sustainability ] Report, providing an in-depth update on our strategy and performance of delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly. In this report, we outlined our progress towards reducing our carbon intensity by double digits by 2025 versus 2019. We expect to deliver on significant milestones of our decarbonization pathway this year including the introduction of advanced technologies on our new ships, such as LNG, fuel cells and a first-of-its-kind onboard waste-to-energy system.\nTo wrap up, the business continues to accelerate, and we are uniquely positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023 on our way to achieving our Trifecta goals. The strength of our brands and operating model continues to grow. We are committed to delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for the Royal Caribbean Group.\nWith that, I will turn it to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by discussing our results for the first quarter.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, we reported an adjusted net loss of approximately $59 million or $0.23 per share. These results were significantly above our expectations and the high end of our guidance range. Total revenue was $2.9 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $642 million, and operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, again, significantly above our expectations. We finished the first quarter with a load factor of over 102% at net yields that were up 5.8% for the quarter or 440 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. Better-than-anticipated close-in demand for Caribbean sailings and improving pricing environment and continued strength in onboard revenue were the main drivers for these exceptional results. Higher load factors drove 2/3 of the yield outperformance and higher pricing drove the remainder.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD, increased 5.8% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2019. Net cruise costs for the first quarter included $2.87 per APCD or 240 basis points impact of structural costs. Operating costs also benefited from approximately 160 basis points of favorable timing compared to guidance. First quarter results are a testament to the continued robust demand environment attractive value proposition of our cruise vacations and strong commitment by our teams to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly.\nTurning to the booking environment. Bookings have consistently been higher than the same time in 2019, with the gap widening as WAVE extended further into the year than ever before. The booking strength has been particularly evident on Caribbean sailings where our superior hardware and Perfect Day at CocoCay continue to be winning combination. More than half of our Caribbean sailings visit Perfect Day at CocoCay, which is Royal Caribbean International's highest-rated destination in the Caribbean. This is a Perfect Day opened midway through the second quarter of 2019. These itineraries are driving outsized yield and pricing growth. While the Caribbean has seen booking strength, performance of our European itineraries is also aligned with our initial expectations. European itineraries account for 17% of full year capacity peaking at 35% in the third quarter. Bookings for our European sailings have been nicely outpacing 2019 levels with peak summer trending particularly well in recent weeks. Several of our newest ships, including Celebrity Beyond, Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn, are sailing in Europe this summer and are attracting quality demand and rates.\nNow let me review our 2023 outlook. If you turn to Slide 8, you will see our updated guidance for the full year 2023. We expect net yield growth of 6.75% to 7.75% for the full year. This represents an approximately 400 basis point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. About 1/3 of the increase is due to strong Q1 results with the remainder due to better business outlook for the rest of the year. The underlying yield improvement is driven by the performance of new hardware, strong demand for our core products, particularly Caribbean itineraries and continued strong growth from onboard revenue areas. While yield growth is expected to ramp up for the rest of the year, there is some variability at the quarter level. Yield growth is likely to be the highest in Q2 where we lapped the opening of Perfect Day at CocoCay and benefit from our Caribbean deployment mix. As you can see from our guidance, yields for the back half of the full year are expected to be up by more than 6%.\nFrom a cost perspective, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year as compared to 2019. Our cost outlook reflects our culture of continuous improvement and innovation. And we are benefiting from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins. Net cruise costs also include 210 basis points of structural cost that we did not have in 2019. Those include, for example, costs related to the full year operations of Perfect Day at CocoCay and our new Galveston terminal. We continue to actively manage persistent inflation across categories, including food and beverage, airfare and shoreside human capital. Our teams continue to find ways to manage through inflation while maintaining exceptional guest experience and increasing profitability. Fuel expense is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion for the year and we are 54% hedged for the remaining of the year. Looking ahead, fuel consumption is 25% hedged for 24% and 5% hedged for 2025. Based on the current business outlook, along with current fuel pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect record adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $4.40 to $4.80.\nNow turning to Slide 9. I'll provide some color on second quarter capacity and guidance. We plan to operate about 11.7 million APCDs during the second quarter. Net yields are expected to be up 10.1% to 10.6% compared to 2019. Exceptional strength in Caribbean itineraries combined with our amazing private island destination Perfect Day at CocoCay is driving the increase in yields. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 8.9% as we continue to focus on margin expansion while revenue accelerates. Second quarter operating costs carry approximately 430 basis points of incremental expenses to weigh on NCCX when compared to 2019, of which half are structural and half are timing from the first quarter. So in summary, based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.60 for the second quarter.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in liquidity. Our liquidity remains very strong, and we are focused on expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA and free cash flow. During the first quarter, we repaid $286 million of debt maturities as well as $2.4 billion of revolver advances. In February, we issued $700 million of senior guaranteed notes at 7.25% coupon to refinance 2023 and 2024 debt maturities. Our access to capital remains strong, and our execution and performance resonate with our investors and financial partners. We will proactively and methodically continue to improve the balance sheet through debt pay downs and opportunistic refinancings. Our remaining scheduled maturities for 2023 are $1.8 billion, made up predominantly of ECA debt amortization, which we expect to pay down with cash on hand and operating cash flow. As the business continues to accelerate and generate strong and growing cash flows, we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation and to return to an investment-grade balance sheet profile in line with our Trifecta goals.\nIn closing, our business continues to accelerate, and we expect to grow yields and margin so we can achieve record adjusted EBITDA in 2023. We remain committed and focused on executing on our strategy and delivering on our mission while achieving Trifecta goals.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

Liberty\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before getting started, and on behalf of the entire Royal Caribbean Group organization, 100,000 proud, I want to express how happy we are that our business has returned to normal. In fact, as you saw in the release this morning, our business is accelerating. So let me get into the detail and start off by talking about the fourth quarter and the full year 2022.\nAs highlighted on Slide 6, 2022 was a challenging but successful transitional year as we returned our business to full operations and delivered memorable vacations to 6 million guests. As you can see on Slide 7, during the fourth quarter, demand for our brands accelerated. We delivered a record 1.8 million vacations, achieved a 95% load factor and successfully returned to Australia for the first time in 3 years. Pricing for our vacation experiences was higher than record 2019 levels when we operated with normalized occupancy and guest satisfaction scores were exceptional. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share were above our expectations and at the high end of our guidance.\nIt is incredible to consider that just 1 year ago, we were in the midst of Omicron, we were still returning our ships to service, and we were sailing at load factors below 60%. Our fourth quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are back, back to usual occupancy, back to our full addressable market, back to EBITDA and cash flow profitability, back to providing full year guidance and most importantly, back to delivering a record number of incredible vacations on the most innovative fleet in the industry.\nWe finished 2022 on a high note and are entering 2023 with the full strength of our operating and commercial platforms. Our strong book position along with the normalization of the booking window provides the visibility needed for us to resume annual guidance, which is in line with our Trifecta program. I am incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well on our mission of delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly and building the foundation for our future growth.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the state of the consumer, so I want to share what we are seeing from daily interactions with consumers who are either booking their dream vacations or who are currently sailing on one of our amazing ships. Overall, we continue to see robust demand from financially healthy, highly engaged consumers that are excited to sail on our brands. Secular tailwinds continue to benefit us as consumer preferences shift from goods to experiences. Entertainment and travel spend remains strong and the job market continues to show resilience. Consumer sentiment has improved and banks have recently reported healthy savings and continued resilience in credit card spending.\nOur addressable market is larger than in 2019 and continues to grow. Our products appeal to a broad range of vacationers with everything from a short getaway to Perfect Day to a luxury world cruise. Cruising remains an exceptionally attractive value proposition. And as I have said in the past, it is too attractive, and we are working very hard every day to close that gap.\nGrowth in cruise search has outpaced general vacation searches, resulting in double the number of visits to our websites compared to 2019. Our brands are attracting new customers into our vacation ecosystem with fourth quarter new-to-cruise and new-to-brand mix above 2019 levels. We are constantly enhancing our commercial capabilities so we can further capture quality demand. Approximately 60% of our guests book some of their onboard activities in advance of their cruise, representing double-digit growth in pre-cruise purchase penetration when compared to 2019 at significantly higher rates.\nAs we have said before, every dollar a guest spends before the cruise translates into about $0.70 when they sail with us and over double the overall spending when compared to other guests. Our guests are now engaging with us to book onboard activities much earlier than in 2019. So far, guests booked on 2023 sailings purchased onboard experiences an average of more than 2 months earlier than in 2019. This translates into more revenue, stickier bookings and happy guests.\nNow I'll provide some insight into the demand environment and what can only be described as a record-breaking WAVE season. As you can see on Slide 8, bookings outpaced 2019 levels by a very wide margin throughout the fourth quarter with particularly strong trends during Cyber Weekend. We expected a strong WAVE season, but what we are currently experiencing has exceeded all expectations even when considering our capacity growth.\nAs a result, and as highlighted on Slide 9, the seven biggest booking weeks in our company's history all occurred since our last earnings call.\nOur commercial apparatus is full speed ahead, and all channels are delivering quality demand above 2019 levels. Our direct-to-consumer channels continue to perform exceptionally well as a combination of consumer preference for digital engagement and our enhanced capabilities is supporting record level bookings. We are also encouraged that our strong base of loyal travel partners continues to recover and supporting our brands with bookings above 2019 levels.\nAs always the case, trends vary by region. We are seeing particularly strong booking trends for North American-based sailings, which account for nearly 70% of our capacity this year. From a cumulative standpoint, these itineraries are now booked at the same load factor as they were in 2019 and at higher prices. Our 2023 European sailings are booked within historical ranges at better rates with recent bookings outpacing 2019 levels. We expect almost 80% of our guests to come from North America as we continue to see particularly healthy demand from that region. Our global brand's appeal and nimble sourcing models allow us to continuously shift sourcing to the highest-yielding guests.\nI will now comment on our outlook for 2023. In 2023, we expect to deliver amazing vacation experiences to over 8 million guests at record yields as we deploy our best-in-class fleet across the best global itineraries. The ramp-up of our load factors in 2022, coupled with a higher and improving pricing environment, is positioning us to fully recover our yields beyond 2019 levels in the first quarter, which is another important milestone, and then ramp up further to record levels as we return to historical load factors in late spring.\nOur strong yield growth outlook is driven by the performance of our new hardware, strong demand for our core products and continued growth from onboard revenue areas. This year, we expect to increase capacity by approximately 14% compared to 2019 with eight new ships already introduced since 2019 and three more set to be delivered this year.\nEach of our wholly-owned brands will welcome a new vessel in 2023. Silversea will welcome Silver Nova, the first of the Evolution class. Celebrity Cruises, will welcome the fourth Edge series ship, Celebrity Ascent and Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of Icon of the Seas, marking the first new ship class for the brand in 9 years, which is sure to set a new standard for vacation experiences.\nIn addition to our incredible new vessels, we plan to launch Hideaway Beach in the fourth quarter of 2023, an adult-only neighborhood, making Perfect Day at CocoCay more perfect and increasing capacity in the island to 13,000 visitors daily.\nOur journey to deepen the relationship with the customer will continue in 2023. We will further enhance our commerce capabilities to optimize our distribution channels, build a deeper connection with guests and lower customer acquisition costs. We will also further enhance our e-commerce and precruise capabilities and focus on increasing our guest repeat rate and spend. We will continue to excel in the core and drive business excellence in order to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. Our teams have been working hard for over 2 years to reshape our cost structure and abate what would have otherwise been at least a 25% increase in nonfuel cost per APCD when compared to 2019.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, is expected to grow 4.75% to 5.75% versus 2019. That's versus a 3-year benchmark that includes a period of significant global inflation. Our cost outlook for the year includes approximately 210 basis points from lingering transitional costs such as crew movement and additional structural costs such as full year operations of Perfect Day at CocoCay and our new Galveston terminal. Our teams have been committed to controlling costs and enhancing profitability while focusing on delivering the best guest experience.\nWe continue to expect the business to accelerate and allow us to deliver record yield and adjusted EBITDA in 2023. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged: Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls leads to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.\nOur ESG ambitions help inform our strategic and financial decisions on a daily basis, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. In 2023, we will continue active efforts towards our target of reducing carbon intensity by double digits by 2025. We also expect to deliver on significant milestones in our decarbonization pathway, including the advanced technologies on our new ships, while also investing in retrofitting our existing fleet with a mission of reducing technology and programs. We will utilize tools to expand supplier diversity and improve our ability to build an exclusive network of suppliers. We will further focus on improving diversity, equity and inclusion and ensure our employees are physically and mentally healthy.\nTo wrap up, 2023 sets the foundation for our Trifecta program. Our people are committed to our mission of delivering the best vacations responsibly and doing so while achieving our Trifecta goals. In 2023, we will be hard at work executing on our strategic pillars, focusing on deepening customer relationships, delivering the best hardware and destinations and excelling in the core. The future of the Royal Caribbean Group is bright. I am confident in our growth trajectory and our ability to deliver on our near-term and long-term goals as well as to reach new financial records.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Naf. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nCFO, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by discussing our results for the fourth quarter.\nAs you can see on Slide 10, we reported a net loss of $500 million or loss per share of $1.96 and adjusted net loss of approximately $300 million or per share of $1.12. The results were above our expectations at the high end of our guidance range. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, operating cash flow was $600 million and adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, again, above our expectation and guidance.\nFourth quarter outperformance was a result of continued strong demand for our brand vacation experiences, strong close-in bookings at higher prices and continued strength of onboard revenue. Better cost management and favorable timing of expenses across several categories, lower fuel rates, lower customer acquisition cost and lower interest expense also contributed to the financial results.\nWe finished the fourth quarter at 95% load factor with peak December holiday sailings at 110%. Load factors varied by itinerary with the Caribbean averaging 100% in both late season Europe and Australia, which opened in Q4 at just under 90%.\nTotal revenue per passenger cruise day was up 4.5% in constant currency compared to the record fourth quarter of 2019. Net yield was down 7.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, a significant improvement for the 14% decline in Q3 and above our expectation. 2022 closed out as a successful transitional year and we generated $8.8 billion of total revenue, $712 million of adjusted EBITDA and almost $500 million of operating cash flow.\nI'll now provide an update on our 2023 business. Let's start with capacity. Our overall capacity for 2023 will be about 14% higher than 2019. Nearly 70% of our '23 capacity will sail on North America-based itineraries, about 17% will be in Europe and close to 10% will be in the APAC region. The remaining capacity will operate in a number of other regions, including South America and Antarctica.\nFrom a cumulative standpoint, our book load factor remains well within historical ranges and we have meaningfully narrowed the gap to 2019 levels. Overall, our North America-based itineraries, many of which visit the amazing Perfect Day at CocoCay, are booked in line with 2019 for the full year and are ahead for Q2 forward at better rates. Sailings in Europe are booked within historical ranges and are catching up. We have seen improved booking trends for these itineraries so far in WAVE, particularly from the U.S. and the U.K. We expect the improvement to continue, supported by our global sourcing model.\nConstant currency net yields are expected to be higher than 2019 in all four quarters with more growth for Q2 through Q4, when load factors returned to normal. The return to yield growth in the first quarter marks a significant point in our recovery and highlights the resilience of our company, the strength of our brands and the consumers' desire to spend on our amazing vacation experiences.\nAs of December 31, our customer deposit balance was $4.2 billion, which is about $400 million higher than our balance at the end of the fourth quarter in 2019.\nShifting to costs. Our teams continue to demonstrate the ability to manage cost pressures while staying focused on our mission of delivering incredible vacation experiences to our guests. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD increased 3.9% as reported and 4.7% in constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net cruise costs for the fourth quarter included $1.23 per APCD or 100 basis point impact of transitory costs related to our health protocols and lagging costs relating to fleet ramp-up and crew movements. We expect these transitory costs to substantially dissipate as the majority of our crew has returned and protocols have eased.\nOur teams have been working constantly for over 2 years on reshaping our cost structure through operational and distribution efficiencies and leveraging group scale. We continue to see the benefits further materialize in 2023 to partially mitigate continued inflationary pressures.\nRegarding fuel. Fuel rates are coming off the highs of last year. We continue to improve consumption and have partially hedged the rate, which is helping us mitigate the volatility and cost of fuel expense. As of today, fuel consumption is 55% hedged for '23 and 10% for 2024.\nAs highlighted on Slide 11, we are resuming annual guidance for the first time in 3 years as we have more visibility into our book of business and the year ahead. We expect net yield growth of 2.5% to 4.5% for the full year. The underlying yield improvement is driven by the performance of new hardware, strong demand for our core products, continued growth from onboard revenue areas, and it also accounts for lower expected load factors versus 2019 levels. We expect yields to ramp up as we will return to historical load factors in late spring such that we achieved record yields and revenue throughout the year.\nNet cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 4.75% to 5.75% for the full year as compared to 2019. Our cost outlook reflects our culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Now let's remember that we are comparing cost figures to a 3-year-old benchmark, including a period of high global inflation. We expect that NCCx also includes 210 basis points of lagging transitory and structural costs.\nInflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions continue to put pressure on costs across many categories, including food and beverage, airfare and shoreside human capital. Our teams continue to find creative ways to manage through inflation and increase profitability.\nLastly, costs in the first half of the year are also burdened by more dry dock days during the second half of the year. Fuel expense is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion for the year, and we are 55% hedged at below market rates. Based on current fuel pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect record adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $3 to $3.60.\nNow turning to Slide 12, I'll provide some color on first quarter capacity and guidance. We plan to operate about 11.2 million APCDs during the first quarter with load factors at 100%. Let me break down first quarter capacity expectations a little more.\nDuring the quarter, approximately 80% of our capacity will operate from North America, mostly sailing to the Caribbean. This is higher than in the first quarter of 2019, particularly for short Caribbean sailings, and we have added more capacity in the region to capitalize on the incredible Perfect Day at CocoCay which was not yet opened 3 years ago. 10% of our capacity is in Australia, close to 5% is in Asia and the remainder spread across multiple other itineraries.\nBased on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted loss per share of $0.65 to $0.85. Net yields are expected to be up 1% to 2% versus 2019 in constant currency. We are excited to finally recover our yields to record 2019 levels and continue to work hard at further growing our yields and revenues as occupancy level normalizes.\nOn the cost side, overall, we expect our net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up approximately 8.5% compared to '19. Similar to the full year guidance, the first quarter carries 320 basis points of transitory costs, structural costs and timing of expenses that are weighing on NCCx when compared to the first quarter of 2019.\nShifting to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in liquidity. Our liquidity remains strong, and we are focused on expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA and free cash flow. Our ultimate goal is to return the balance sheet to an investment-grade profile.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt maturities and closed on the refinancing of $2 billion of secured and guaranteed debt previously due June 2023. Additionally, in January, we successfully extended $2.3 billion of our existing revolver credit facility commitment to April 2025. Our access to capital remains strong, and our execution and performance will resonate with our investors and financial partners. We will proactively and methodically continue to manage near-term maturities and improve the balance sheet.\nFor 2023, our scheduled debt maturities are $2.1 billion, made up of predominantly ECA debt amortization, which we expect to pay down with cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations. Our business continues to accelerate, and we expect to grow yields and control costs, such as we achieved record yields and adjusted EBITDA in 2023 as we regained the tremendous profitability of our business. Our strong book position and enhanced commercial capabilities provide further visibility into 2023 and remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering our mission while achieving the Trifecta goals.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a Q&A session."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Michael McCarthy, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVP of IR, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2022 Business Update Conference Call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bailey, President and CEO of World Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our website and in our earnings release available at www.rclinvestor.com.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our third quarter results, and an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions. But first, we will start the call with a video highlighting and introducing our trifecta program.\n(presentation)\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Over the past several months, our teams have been very busy and focused on generating strong quality demand combating inflation and most of all, delivering the best vacations in the world as we return our business closer to historical load factors while maintaining price integrity and generating $3 billion in revenue and almost $750 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter.\nAs you have seen in our announcement this morning, we have announced a 3-year financial performance program that we have termed Project Trifecta.\nNow before getting into the details of the program, let's first talk about how the business is performing. As our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the strength of our vacation platform, which includes our leading global brands, the best and most innovative ships in the industry and a powerful and nimble commercial apparatus, coupled with strong execution by our operating teams have delivered another quarter of strong performance that exceeded our expectations. Our entire fleet is operating globally in our key destinations. Demand for our experiences was very strong, and we achieved 96% load factors overall, with the Caribbean at close to 105% at record pricing and high satisfaction scores.\nWe delivered adjusted EBITDA of $742 million and positive earnings per share of $0.26, which was above our guidance. Our strong financial performance, coupled with proactive refinancing actions, further strengthened our already strong liquidity position and improved our debt maturity profile. I am thankful and proud of everyone at the World Caribbean Group for delivering the best vacation experiences to our customers in a responsible way, while executing so well on our recovery and building on our future. The successful return of our business to full operations and the accelerating demand environment positions us well to deliver on our expectations of record yields and record adjusted EBITDA in 2023.\nNext, let me elaborate on the Trifecta Program we announced this morning. With the operational return of our business well in hand, we are now focusing the team and our stakeholders on returning to record financial performance and beyond. The introduction of the Trifecta program provides us the coordinates we are looking to achieve over the next few years while delivering the best vacations in the world responsibly. Specifically, we are focused on achieving 3 metrics by 2025, growing EBITDA profitability per APCD to triple digits, delivering double-digit earnings and achieving a return on invested capital in the teams. We look to achieve these metrics while we return the balance sheet back to investment-grade profile and reduce our carbon intensity by double digits compared to 2019 as part of our commitment and focus on advancing the sustainability of our business.\nOur formula for success is based on moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline. For those who have followed us for some time, this will sound very familiar as we demonstrated in the past, it leads to strong financial performance and does not assume a perfect operating environment. Our plan is well grounded in a set of underlying strategies, robust secular and demographic trends, a strong culture and a powerful foundation of leading global brands, the most innovative fleet in the industry and the very best people. The main thrust of our plan is to take further advantage of our strong foundation and further orient our ecosystem around the customer by enhancing our commercial apparatus and product offerings.\nBy doing this, we will further enhance customer preference, engagement, cruise frequency, guest experience and spend. This, combined with expanding our fleet through innovative new ships and land-based experiences like Perfect Day at CocoCay will drive our profitability growth and strong cash flow generation. Disciplined capital allocation to high returning investments will allow us to reduce leverage while investing in our future and delivering a strong shareholder value.\nTrifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp. However, base camp is not our final destination. Our ambitions go well beyond it. And while it may not always be a straight line and there may be some choppy waves from time to time, we are confident in our leading platform and ability to execute on our strategies to deliver those goals over the next few years.\nBefore going into the booking commentary, I wanted to share some of the behaviors that we are seeing from our guests. Global demand for travel is ramping up as consumers continue to shift spend to experiences. Well, this is good news to us as we are squarely in the experience business. The value proposition of cruise remains incredibly attractive. I would say, too attractive. Our full addressable market is back, and our brands are attracting new customers into our vacation ecosystem.\nAs a result, gas mix for the quarter was equally distributed across loyalty, new to cruise and new to our brand, similar to what we saw in 2019.\nLet me highlight some observations from our daily engagement with our customers. This quarter, we delivered 1.7 million amazing vacation experiences, and we have more than 130,000 guests sailing on our ships globally every day. The positioning of our brands attracts guests across broad demographics, psychographics and at a median household income above $100,000. This provides us a unique vantage point on what our guests are looking for in their behaviors.\nOverall, across markets, brands and products, we continue to see a financially healthy, highly engaged consumer with a strong hunger to dream and seek a variety of vacation experiences. Our commercial apparatus is seeing elevated booking activity across channels as we help our customers design their dream vacations. Our guests are willing to spend more than ever with us to create those memories.\nConsumers are engaging earlier in the planning their vacation with about 60% purchasing onboard experiences before they even set sail. This has led to an 8-point increase in penetration and much higher revenue APD related to pre-cruise purchases versus 2019 levels. Our guests continue to seek the rich experiences we offer, spending significantly more on board our ships compared to 2019 across nearly all categories.\nAll this is translating into strong booking activity. During the third quarter, we saw both strong demand for close-in sailings and accelerating demand for sailings in 2023.\nNext, let me talk a little bit more about the new ships that are planned to join our fleet next year. Our innovative new ships and onboard experiences will allow us to continue to differentiate our offering as well as deliver superior yields and margins.\nTwo weeks ago, we revealed details on our new and amazing Icon of the Seas, which will be delivered in late 2023 ahead of its January 2024 debut. It is a game-changing first of its kind vacation experience, where everyone can experience their version of the ultimate vacation.\nIcon will have 8 distinct neighborhoods, each a destination in and of itself, packed with an array of amazing experiences. The ships state room configuration will allow for load factors to be accretive to the overall portfolio and the ship will be significantly accretive to our key financial metrics. The ship opened for sale about a week ago, and the market response was nothing short of remarkable. On the first day of bookings, we far surpassed our previous single-day booking record for the brand and the company overall, and it wasn't even close. With each new ship, we raise the bar in the travel industry while enhancing what our guests know and love.\nIn addition to Icon, Celebrity set will join the Celebrity Fleet in the fourth quarter of 2023, and Silver Nova will join the Silversea fleet in late summer.\nIn the coming days, we will open a brand-new flagship terminal in Galveston, Texas. The new terminal significantly expands our capacity in the region with the ability to accommodate the larger Oasis class ships and give us further access into the attractive drive 2 markets of Texas, Oklahoma and the entire Southeast region. The facility will also be the first cruise terminal to generate a 100% of its needed energy from on-site solar panels and will be the first Zero Energy cruise terminal facility in the world.\nWhile we are still early in our planning cycle, 2023 is shaping up to be a strong year for the company and a return to normal typical business. Our overall capacity will grow 14% compared to 2019 on account of 10 new ships, which have joined or will join the fleet across our brands during this period, net of dispositions. Our deployment across markets is relatively unchanged compared to 2019, with Caribbean representing just over half of our overall deployment. Europe at almost 20% and in Asia in the low single digits with no planned deployment in the high-yielding China market.\nAbout 80% of the population is within driving distance to a U.S. home port and we have upsized the short Caribbean product by 35% compared to 2019.\nAlmost 65% of guests sailing on Royal Internationals Caribbean itineraries will experience Perfect day At CocoCay in 2023, up from 30% in 2019. We expect almost 80% of 2023 guest sourcing to come from North America as we continue to see particularly strong demand from that customer. Our global brands appeal and nimble sourcing model allow us to attract the highest yielding guests and partially mitigate the impact from the strong dollar.\nWhile 2022 bookings remain strong and on pace to achieve occupancy's targets, the most notable change over the past few months has been a substantial acceleration in demand for 2023 sales. We received twice as many bookings for 2023 sailings in Q3 as we did in Q2, resulting in considerably higher booking volumes than during the same period for 2019 sailings.\nAs a result, all 4 quarters of 2023 are booked well within historical ranges at record prices with bookings accelerating every week. While the last 3 years were certainly challenging, the resiliency of our business allowed us to recover quickly and be fully back up and running. Our operating platform is larger and stronger than it has ever been with the best brands, best ships and best people. Our commercial capabilities allow us to reach more quality demand and our itineraries are strategically planned to appeal to both new-to-cruise and loyal customers.\nThe value proposition of cruising remains incredibly attractive, and we have an opportunity to close the gap to other land vacation alternatives as we grow our addressable market. We continue to expect the business to accelerate as we close out 2022 and set a strong foundation for us to deliver record yields and adjusted EBITDA in 2023.\nOur formula for success remains unchanged. As we have demonstrated in the past, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls lead to enhanced profitability and superior financial performance as we seek to improve the balance sheet.\nThe future of the Royal Caribbean Group is bright. With our strong platform and proven strategies, I'm confident in our recovery trajectory and our ability to deliver on the Trifecta program as well as reach new financial records.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nCFO, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by discussing our results for the third quarter. This morning, we reported a net profit of approximately $60 million or $0.26 per share above the high end of our guidance range. Total revenue was just shy of $3 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $742 million. Third quarter outperformance was a result of continued strong demand for our brand's vacation experiences, especially after the easing of health protocols, continued strength of onboard revenue and better cost management. The successful ramp-up of our operations completed earlier this summer has positioned us well to return to generating consistent financial performance and recovering towards our record 2019 levels and beyond.\nWe finished the third quarter at a 96% load factor with peak August sailings at close to 100%. Both factors varied by itinerary with Caribbean averaging close to 105%; Alaska at about 96% and Europe, as expected, at just under 90%.\nAlso as expected, total revenue per passenger cruise day was up 1% in constant currency compared to the record third quarter of 2019. Strong demand for our brands and outperformance in onboard revenue mitigated the negative impact from FCC redemption and the lower-than-average load factors on higher-priced Europe and Alaska sailings.\nOur goal has always been to maximize our revenue yields as we optimize occupancy and pricing. With our ramp-up almost complete, we are nearing the point of full recovery to our record 2019 yields. Our constant currency yield improved by 8% in the third quarter, and we expect a similar improvement in the fourth quarter. We expect yields to continue ramping up in the first half of 2023 as we return to historical load factors in late spring.\nNext, I will comment on capacity and load factor expectations over the upcoming period. We plan to operate about 11.7 million APCDs during the fourth quarter with load factors close to the third quarter.\nHistorically, our third quarter load factors have always been higher than the fourth quarter due to peak summer family travel. This year, as we are continuing to ramp up, we do not expect a decline in overall occupancy quarter-over-quarter.\nLet me break down fourth quarter load factors and capacity expectations a little more. During the quarter, our ships transitioned to their winter itineraries and as a result, 2/3 of our capacity is in North America. Our remaining capacity is mostly split between late season Europe, Australia and repositioning voyages. We expect Caribbean sailings to continue to sell at triple-digit load factors with slightly lower occupancies on late-season Europe sailings, which are just about 10% of capacity for the quarter. We are returning to Australia for the first time in 3 years, and as a result, expect to build to load factors in the low to mid-90s. We expect to return to overall historical occupancy level by late spring of 2023.\nOur customer deposit balance as of September 30 was $3.8 billion, which is about $400 million higher than our balance at the end of the third quarter in 2019.\nAs we previously shared, now that the full fleet is in service and occupancy is ramping up, we are returning to a more typical seasonality in customer deposit levels. In 2019, our customer deposit balance declined by about $500 million between the end of Q2 and the end of Q3. The seasonal decrease was smaller this year as we continue to see stronger booking volumes.\nIn the third quarter, over 95% of total bookings were new versus future cruise credit redemptions. Guest sailing with FCCs impact our APDs by about 1% this year, and we expect the impact to be smaller next year. Less than 20% of our customer deposit balance is related to FCCs.\nShifting to costs. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD, improved 11% as reported and 10% in constant currency compared to the second quarter of '22. Net cruise costs for the quarter also included $3.37 per APCD of transitory costs related to health protocols and onetime lagging costs related to fleet ramp-up. We still expect to have transitory costs in the fourth quarter, but as we are nearing full occupancies and full crew staffing levels and are adapting our protocols, we expect them to significantly ease.\nSimilar to other businesses around the world, we continue to actively manage inflationary pressures that, for us, mainly related to fuel and food costs. Our teams continue to demonstrate the ability to manage cost pressures while staying focused on our mission of delivering the incredible vacation experiences that are expected by our guests.\nIn fact, year-to-date, we have consistently been able to abate about 1/3 of the market increases as we observed through benchmarks across various categories, all while achieving consistently high NPS scores. We will continue to both monitor the inflationary cycle as well as focus on mitigation strategies as we enter 2023.\nRegarding fuel, we have seen fuel rates coming off the highs of earlier in the year, but they are still volatile. We continue to improve consumption and have partially hedged the rate, which is helping us mitigate the volatility and cost of fuel expense. As of today, fuel consumption is 64% hedged for the fourth quarter and 50% hedged for 2023.\nNCC, excluding fuel per APCD in the fourth quarter is expected to be higher by low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This includes a few percentage points of transitory costs related to protocols and ramp-up of operations.\nLower expenses related to returning ships and crew to operations and easing health protocols are supporting the improvement in costs.\nIn addition, the benefits from actions taken during the pandemic to improve margins continue to materialize, and we expect them to ramp up in the fourth quarter and into 2023. We expect these actions to partially mitigate the inflationary pressures we expect to continue to weigh on our cost through the first half of '23.\nShifting to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in liquidity. Our liquidity position remains strong, and we are focused on expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA and free cash flow. Our ultimate goal is to return the balance sheet to an investment-grade profile.\nDuring the third quarter, we took multiple proactive actions to address $5.6 billion of 2022 and 2023 maturities. Since early August, we issued $1.25 billion of unsecured notes to refinance remaining '22 maturities and refinanced $2.8 billion of '23 maturities and that were previously backstopped by a Morgan Stanley commitment.\nWe also extended for 1 year the commitment to a $700 million term loan and extended a $500 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in 2023. All these transactions have been well received by investors, and we were able to upsize and improve pricing. Our access to capital remains strong, and our execution and performance resonate with our investors.\nWhile rates are higher than what we were able to issue earlier in the year, we have included early redemption features to allow for refinancings or pay down prior to maturity. For 2023, our scheduled debt maturities are $2.1 billion, made up of predominantly ECA debt amortization, which we expect to pay down with cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations.\nNow turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter of '22, and based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect to generate approximately $2.6 billion in total revenue, adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million and adjusted loss per share of $1.30 to $1.50. The combination of our strong brands, amazing experiences and focus on building quality demand position us well for '23. We expect yields to continue ramping up in the first half of '23 based on our return to historical load factors but lay Spring.\nI want to take a moment to highlight certain changes in our yield profile and cost base. Over the last several years, we divested the Pullmantur and Azamara brands as well as several other small ships across the fleet.\nIn addition, we do not have any China deployment planned for '23, and we have increased our short Caribbean product. The net effect is a slight reduction in yield but an increase in overall profitability. New ship additions for Celebrity and Silversea result in those brands being a larger percentage of our overall mix in '23 as compared to 2019. These additions are expected to add to our yield and return profile, but also have a higher cost per berth.\nOur shift to more North American itineraries reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rates, with about 20% of our revenue expected to be sourced in non-USD currencies versus just over a quarter in prior years.\nWith that said, exchange rates for a basket of currencies are down on average 9% versus 2019.\nWe are very excited about the introduction of the Trifecta program. As we demonstrated before, our proven formula should once again result in strong financial performance. By 2025, our capacity is expected to grow by 6% on an annual basis compared to 2019 with the introduction of 17 new ships across our brands and markets. We expect new ships as well as our relentless focus on the customer to drive additional yield benefits, cost efficiencies and profitability of at least triple-digit EBITDA per APCD by '25.\nEvery 1% improvement in yield in 2025 will result in $130 million more in revenue and every 1% of change in NCC, excluding fuel, will result in $60 million benefit in operating costs. Increasing EBITDA per APCD to triple digits will allow us to generate strong and growing cash flow and together with disciplined capital allocation, and pay down of debt, return to an investment grade balance sheet profile. We will stay focused on executing on our strategy to achieve strong financial results by growing yields, expanding margins and improving the balance sheet. We have done it before. We have the best brands, the best assets and the best people as we build a bright future of the Royal Caribbean Group.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for Q&A."

My name is Joanne, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Royal Caribbean Group Business Update and Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Michael McCarthy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. McCarthy, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVP of IR, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2022 business update conference call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our website and on our earnings release available at www.rclinvestor.com.\nJason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our second quarter results and an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Over the past several months, our teams have reached several very important milestones in our pursuit to quickly return our business back to 2019 financial metrics and beyond.\nIn June, we successfully completed the return of our entire fleet into operation. This was a Herculean task by our team, and I'm so thankful and proud of our shipboard and shoreside teams who have worked so incredibly hard under unthinkable and ever-changing circumstances to execute on such a successful return to delivering the best vacations in the world.\nOur complete operating platform is now up and running. That platform, which includes our leading brand, the most innovative fleet in the industry, our global sourcing and technology apparatus and the best people in the world. It is now positioned to deliver the best vacations in the world responsibly and accelerate our business back to superior financial performance.\nAnother major milestone for the group this past quarter was that our business turned operating cash flow and EBITDA positive. During the second quarter, we achieved earlier than we had expected, positive EBITDA and operating cash flow. This achievement further strengthened our liquidity position and positions us well to continue methodically and proactively improving the balance sheet and refinancing near-term maturities as we seek to return to 2019 metrics and beyond swiftly.\nThis outperformance in Q2 versus our expectations was driven by continued strength in our onboard revenue and accelerating load factors, which hit nearly 90% in June and delivered 82% for the quarter. This combination led us to achieving higher total revenue per guest versus 2019 levels. Our North American itineraries are now sailing at over 100% load factors, and we are building on this momentum as we expect to reach load factors in the mid-90s in Q3 and then return to triple-digit load factors globally by year-end. This will set us up very well for 2023.\nThe combination of consumers' strong propensity to experience in travel, accelerating demographic trends, which are pulling in more bucket list and multigenerational travel, a very compelling value proposition and a strong preference for our brand is translating into strengthening demand.\nLastly, the other major milestone for the group and the industry is related to the CDC ending its program for cruise ships as we are now transitioning to the point where everyone will be able to vacation with us. As we've always said, the health and safety of our guests, crew and communities we visit are our top priority, and cruising has proven to be one of the safest environments anywhere.\nAfter 2 years of successfully working with us, the CDC has transitioned from enforcing protocols and policies for the cruise industry to suggestions and recommendations to be in line with the travel and tourism sector. That speaks to the great work we've done together as an industry.\nWhile we plan to continue to operate our healthy return-to-service shipboard protocols, one immediate change that I'm happy to report is that starting August 8, pre-embarkation testing for vaccinated guests on voyages of 5 days or less will no longer be required. This will be subject to local destination requirements, and we will continue to test all unvaccinated guests. We also anticipate in the not-too-distant future that pre-embarkation testing for longer duration voyages will be reduced.\nBefore going into the booking commentary, I wanted to share some of the behaviors that we are actually seeing from our guests. Now keep in mind that every day, we have well over 100,000 guests experiencing and spending on our ships. Every day, we take tens of thousands of bookings from our guests looking to travel to a wide range of destinations, anywhere from a quick weekend getaway to perfect day to a bucket list trip to the Galapagos Islands or Antarctica.\nEvery day, we witness and engage in millions of interactions on our websites and through our call centers as guests learn about and book their dream vacations. We see a lot.\nOverall, we continue to see a financially healthy, highly engaged consumer with a strong hunger to dream and seek experiences, and they are willing to spend more than ever with us to create those memories.\nLet me give you some more concrete data points. The 100,000-plus guests that we have on our ship every day, including the 125,000 guests that are currently on our ships today, have been spending at least 30% more on board our ships across all categories when compared to 2019. These spending trends have been consistent across our customer base even as we are approaching full load factors.\nApproximately 60% of our guests book their onboard activities before they ever step foot on our ships. As we said in the past, every dollar guest spends before the voyage translates into about $0.70 more on the dollar when they sail with us and double the overall spending compared to other guests.\nAs we look into the second half of 2022, pre-cruise revenue APDs are up over 40% versus 2019 levels. The strong consumer demand in our commercial and technical capabilities are contributing to the strong performance.\nOur distribution channels are now fully up and running. Our websites are receiving close to double the visits compared to 2019, and we are generating record level of direct bookings. In addition, our trade partners are fully up and running and are generating bookings in excess of 2019 levels.\nWe are also seeing in our consumer data that cruise interest is now basically back to 2019 levels as the continued easing of travel protocols and the attractive value proposition is making cruising more and more appealing. The attractive new-to-cruise segment is now returning faster with non-loyalty guests doubling in Q2 compared to Q1, and the mix is essentially on par with 2019 levels. Our attractive brands as well strategically adjusted deployment towards shorter itineraries are driving more new-to-cruise.\nWe also continued to benefit from secular tailwinds anchored in the shift of consumer preferences from goods to experiences. And we are squarely in the experience business. Recreational services are now growing 4x the rate of goods and are expected to continue to outpace 2019 levels.\nFavorable demographic trends support our growth as well. More than 3 million adults retired during COVID, doubled than what was expected. Meanwhile, millennials are financially healthy, as they reach their peak earning years, forming households and looking for vacations with their families. These trends, combined with the emergence of more paid time off and more flexible work environments, allow guests to spend more vacation time on our cruise ships.\nThe value proposition for cruising remains incredibly attractive and the strength of our brands and platform allows us to continue and capture this quality demand as we ramp up the business this year and build for a successful 2023 and beyond. All this quality demand is translating into strong booking activity.\nDuring the second quarter, we saw a strong demand for close in sailings, which contributed to better-than-expected load factors. Bookings for 2022 sailings averaged about 30% above 2019 levels throughout the second quarter and more recently have been up to 35%. The second half of 2022 is booked below historical ranges, but at higher prices than 2019 with and without future cruise credits.\nCancellations are at pre-COVID levels. In addition, we are now seeing the booking window starting to extend back out, providing further confidence in forward-looking business as our guests thoughtfully planned for the future. As a result, all 4 quarters of 2023 are booked within historical ranges at record prices with bookings accelerating every week. Our customer deposits are at record levels and over 90% of bookings made in the second quarter were new, while steady FCC redemptions continued.\nInflation continues to impact businesses across the globe, and we are no exception. As we discussed before, food and fuel are the main categories for us that are susceptible to inflation. We continue to navigate those cost pressures as we seek to enhance our margin profile while delivering the incredible vacation experiences that are expected by our guests.\nThere are some initial positive signs with respect to inflation trends in our food basket. Our more recent month-over-month F&B inflation indicator has increased at the slowest pace thus far in 2022. This, combined with direct conversations with our key suppliers, indicate inflation levels are peaking and that we would start seeing some relief in the coming months.\nOn the fuel side, we continue to optimize consumption and have partially hedged the rate below market prices, which is mitigating the impact on our fuel costs.\nAs we mentioned in the last few quarters, we have taken and continue to take numerous actions to reshape the cost structure of the business to support growing margins as we execute on our recovery. We are starting to see benefits of these efforts as we ramp up the fleet to full operations. We also expect the growth in margins to accelerate in the second half and into 2023.\nEarlier this month, we acquired the ultra-luxury cruise ship Endeavor. Originally delivered in 2021, the ship joined Silversea Cruises expedition fleet. The ship is scheduled to begin service this November in Antarctica with bookings already commencing. This opportunistic acquisition allows us to add capacity and capture growth opportunities in a very attractive expedition segment.\nFinancially, it was a unique opportunity to acquire a brand-new, high-quality expedition vessel significantly below the building costs and that is fully financed through an attractive, long-term unsecured financing arrangement. We expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings, cash flow and ROIC.\nWhile the last 2.5 years were certainly challenging, we have proven that our business and company are resilient. Our business is now fully back up and running, and our operating platform is larger and stronger than it has ever been. We have the best brands in their respective segments, industry-leading ships and one-of-a-kind private destinations like Perfect Day. Our diverse distribution channels and commercial capabilities allow us to reach more quality demand. Our itineraries are strategically planned to be closer to home with an emphasis on shorter itineraries that appeal to both new-to-cruise and loyal customers.\nOur data shows that consumers seek vacations in all economic conditions. Cruising has always been an attractive value proposition when compared to land-based vacation alternatives. And that is truer today than ever before.\nOur strategy remains consistent, continue to ramp up occupancy to generate yield growth while managing costs, enhancing profitability and repairing our balance sheet. Our business has a proven track record of generating robust cash flows through various economic cycles and our platform is bigger and better than ever before. Our liquidity is strong, and we have access to capital as we look to refinance debt and improve our balance sheet.\nWe continue to expect 2022 to be a strong transitional year as we approach historical occupancy levels. This will set a strong foundation for success into 2023 and beyond. We are also providing guidance for the third quarter for the first time since Q1 of 2020.\nWith our stronger platform and proven strategies, I am confident about our recovery trajectory and the future of the Royal Caribbean Group.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nCFO, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by discussing our results for the second quarter.\nThis morning, we reported a net loss of approximately $500 million or $2.05 per share for the quarter. Revenue was $2.2 billion, double the first quarter. And we generated almost $0.5 billion of operating cash flow. EBITDA was $124 million and turned positive in May, a month before our expectations.\nSecond quarter results were meaningfully ahead of our expectations driven by accelerating demand, further improvement in onboard revenue and better cost performance. We expect these trends to continue.\nOur business is now back to generating cash beyond our operating and capital costs, which is further strengthening our strong liquidity position. It also positions us to continue to methodically and proactively improve the balance sheet and refinance near-term maturities.\nAs Jason mentioned, we finished the second quarter at 82% load factors with June at just about 90% and North American product at about 100% overall. And in fact, our Caribbean itineraries finished the quarter at a load factor of 103% overall, with some ships receiving particularly strong close-in demand and sailing with occupancies as high as 107%. Our Northeast and West Coast products, including Alaska, sailed at around 90% in June. Load factors on our European itineraries, which were impacted by the Ukraine war averaged 75% in June.\nDuring the second quarter, total revenue per passenger cruise day increased 5% in constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2019. Both ticket and onboard revenue continue to perform well for us even as we approach full occupancy.\nAs we discussed before, the inclusive pricing and packages offered by our brands blur the line between ticket and onboard revenue. Our goal is to maximize overall revenue, and the best way to evaluate performance is by focusing on our total cruise revenue metrics.\nNext, I will comment on capacity and load factor expectations over the coming period. We plan to operate about 11.6 million APCDs during the third quarter. From a deployment standpoint, just over 1/3 of our capacity is in the Caribbean, 1/3 is in Europe, and the remainder is mostly sailing North American itineraries, such as Alaska and Bermuda.\nAs Jason mentioned, we have consistently seen strong demand across all open deployment. Overall, we expect load factors of approximately 95% for the third quarter and triple digits by the end of the year.\nLet me break down third quarter load factors by itinerary. We have been sailing at above 100% in the Caribbean since mid-June, and most of our other North American base itineraries are now averaging about 100%. The ramp-up has been a bit slower for European sailings, which were impacted by Omicron, the war in Ukraine and the COVID testing requirement for travelers returning to the United States.\nThe lifting of the testing requirement occurred well into the typical booking window for Europe. And while we saw improved booking trends, it occurred too late to have a meaningful impact on this summer sailings. Despite that, European sailings are now achieving average load factors of around 85%, but still well below other key itineraries in the third quarter.\nThis has two main impacts on our metrics. First, it pushed our recovery of 100% fleet-wide occupancy to the fourth quarter of 2022. And second, overall pricing appears less favorable in the third quarter when compared to 2019 levels because European sailings generate higher-than-average prices. The impact to pricing is isolated to the third quarter because of the heavier weighting of European deployment. Adjusting for this impact, price trends are more similar to the mid-single digits in recent quarters.\nAs expected, book load factors for sailings in the second half of 2022 remained below historical levels at slightly higher rates than 2019, both including and excluding FCCs. As Jason mentioned, accelerating demand levels and the recent booking pace are aligned with our load factor expectations for the third quarter.\nOur customer deposit balance as of June 30 was $4.2 billion, a record high for the company. Now that the full fleet is in service and occupancy is ramping up, we expect to return to a more typical seasonality in customer deposit levels.\nIn the second quarter, approximately 90% of total bookings were new versus FCC redemptions. We continue to see the redemption of FCCs by our customers as ships returned back into service, deployment firmed up and protocols have been easing. To date, approximately 60% of the FCC balance has been redeemed and half of those have already sailed. Approximately 20% of customer deposit balance is related to FCCs, which is a 7% improvement from the last quarter.\nFor new bookings, we have returned to typical booking and cancellation policies that were relaxed during the pandemic.\nShifting to costs. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD improved 60% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The second quarter costs included $7.75 per APCD related to enhanced health protocols and onetime costs to return ships and crew back to operations. We expect to see a significant improvement in net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half.\nLower expenses related to returning ships and crew to operations and easing health protocols as well as the fact that the full fleet is now back in operations are driving this improvement. In addition, the benefit from actions taken during the last 2 years to improve margins are now beginning to materialize as the full fleet is operating and occupancies are returning to historical levels. We expect this benefit to continue its ramp-up through 2022 and into 2023.\nAs Jason mentioned, we are actively managing inflationary pressures, mainly related to fuel and food. Our teams continue to demonstrate the ability to manage cost pressures while delivering the incredible vacations expected by our guests. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD, are expected to be higher by mid-single digits for the second half of 2022 when compared to 2019. Third quarter is expected to be higher.\nOn the fuel side, we continue to improve consumption and have partially hedged the rate below market prices, which is mitigating the impact on our fuel costs. As of today, fuel consumption is 56% hedged for the remainder of 2022 and 36% for 2023. In the third quarter of 2022, our hedge position is 49%, which is slightly lower than the average for the second half of the year. On the other hand, consumption continues to improve across the fleet, driven by benefits from our prior investments to reduce our energy consumption and adding 8 new vessels to our fleet in the last 18 months.\nShifting to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in liquidity. During the second quarter, we generated almost $0.5 billion of operating cash flow and repaid $700 million of debt maturities.\nOur liquidity remains strong, and we are now generating cash beyond our operating and capital costs. We are also expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA and free cash flow.\nWe are very focused on returning to the balance sheet we had pre-COVID. Our plan is to methodically and proactively refinance near-term maturities and debt issued during the pandemic. We have demonstrated access to capital through the last 2 years, even in very challenging conditions as well as thoughtful management of the balance sheet.\nNow turning to guidance. We are providing guidance for the third quarter for the first time since Q1 2020. For the third quarter, and based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect to generate $2.9 billion to $3 billion in total revenues, adjusted EBITDA of $700 million to $750 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 to $0.25. Due to increases in fuel rates, interest rates and foreign exchange, we expect a slight net loss for the second half of 2022.\nWe stay focused on executing on our recovery by ramping up our load factors, expanding margins and managing the balance sheet. When our business is fully operational, it generates significant cash flow. We are confident in our ability to continue on our recovery as we build the future of the Royal Caribbean Group.\nWith that, I will ask our operator to open the call for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand over to our CEO, Paul Cruickshank.\n\nP. D. Cruickshank\n\nCEO, RCL Foods Limited\n\nGood morning, everybody. It is great to be presenting to you for the first time as the CEO of RCL Foods, and I'm looking forward to engaging with you during the session and the journey ahead. As we have done in the past, I will give a brief overview of our performance and strategic progress, Rob will take you through the financials in more detail. And then Marthinus, Chris and I will go through the headlines around each division's performance.\nMoving to Slide 4. Our key highlights for the 6 months ended December 2021, our key message is that we have made solid progress from a financial and strategic point of view despite some significant headwinds. Not only is consumer spending under increasing pressure as a result of rising unemployment numbers post the COVID lockdowns and the July riots, but the continued high cost of raw material commodities have placed considerable pressure on our margins.\nOur response, consistent in the past years, has been to focus on what we can control, execute the basics well and actively pursue our strategic goals. This focus has helped us deliver a pleasing 9.2% revenue increase, despite a number of categories being under pressure from a volume perspective.\nThe majority of our brands have increased their market share, resulting in a 14.4% statutory EBITDA increase, which flowed through to a 21.6% improvement in our HEPS. The more muted underlying EBITDA increase of 2.5% clearly speaks to the margin pressure our business units are under and which we are working hard to mitigate. Cash generated by operations was up significantly, and Rob will speak to that further.\nMoving to Slide 5, which breaks down our underlying EBITDA performance per business units. EBITDA improved at an underlying level in all business units except Baking. Groceries continues its resilient performance with Pet Food once again a standout performer. Whilst Baking came under pressure despite good volume growth in Bread, Buns & Rolls due to high input commodity cost environment.\nSugar had another good period, driven by strong focus on operational efficiencies, supported by favorable local market conditions and Vector has continued its turnaround from a revenue and earnings perspective, aided by the continued integration of its network as well as the restoration of volumes to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nChicken improved, albeit off a low base, with margins still modest in absolute terms. This was delivered through a combination of focus on agriculture performance and improved pricing realizations.\nSlide 6 is an update on our bigger picture strategic progress. As you are aware, our strategic portfolio review in 2021 gave rise to 2 key decisions, to separate our value-added brand previously referred to as FMCG, food business from our Chicken, Vector and Sugar businesses to enable them to grow in a more pure play environment and to actively grow the value-added brand component by our strategic focus and investment. We've undertaken a number of actions to progress this 2-part strategic intent.\nWe consolidated the RCL Foods Group and Food Division executive structures into 1, and that enabled us to simultaneously reengineer our organization in line with our value-added growth strategy, and I'll come back to that on the next slide.\nWe've completed the legal separation of Chicken, Sugar and Vector logistics businesses into independent legal entities in preparation for different strategic options. Management has prioritized alignment and clarity on ways of working and accountability with respect to Chicken and Vector Logistics, while Sugar's operating model continued unchanged in the medium term.\nAs we have said previously, we believe in the potential of each of these businesses and will continue to support the growth of each by giving careful and responsible consideration to the next steps. At the same time, we have pivoted our strategy to focus on value-added growth, which brings me to Slide 7.\nOur vision is to build a focused value-added branded food business that generates sustainable shareholder value. To do so, we need a business driven by diverse high-performance culture, one with right scale and which is built to last. These key elements are captured in 3 pillars and will be enabled by our strategic thrust and our sharpened strategy.\nOur new flatter executive structure and value-added brands focused operating model will enable -- will further aid the delivery of this. As a key first step towards scaling the business, we have carried out a full evaluation of the South African food landscape and are clear on the categories in which we'd like to extend either organically or via acquisition activity.\nIn scaling the business, we will seek to leverage our brand strength and differentiated capabilities, including our national platform, which we see as a key enabler. We will be updating the market as when appropriate, on next steps in our journey.\nI'll now hand over to Rob, who will take us through the financial review.\n\nRobert Hilton Field\n\nCFO, Financial Director & Executive Director, RCL Foods Limited\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning to you all. I'm going to start on Slide 8, which is really just a landing slide summary of all the financials. Pleasing to see, as Paul has highlighted, mostly green -- positive variances on this reporting period. And in the subsequent slides, I'll cover off most of the pertinent matters and the only 2 just to pause on here on this first slide not covered elsewhere.\nJust to remind you in terms of how we express a view of our underlying results, obviously, front lining with the statutory or reported numbers, but we seek to give you insights to some of the more material and more importantly, once-off items that have taken place in the period to give you a perspective of our underlying performance, and we repeat that through the analysis.\nSecondly, we're not going to touch on dividend again other than just you noted here. We have kept the dividend the same as the previous period. The market I know is familiar with our approach. Where we don't target a specific dividend cover and especially at interims. We are concerned about the outlook for the second half of the year. So our sending a message of that we're still in a good dividend paying position and hence have held the dividends, but we would prefer to give specific guidance associated with our full year numbers in August.\nMoving on to Slide 9. Paul has highlighted that the period's performance on an underlying basis is driven by Sugar, Chicken and Vector's performance relative to the prior period. But here on this chart, on this waterfall chart, you can see the extent of the once-off items which we strip out of our underlying perspective. And most of them relates to Chicken. Certainly, in the prior period, the COVID and the IFRS 9 adjustments on commodity procurement and then the civil unrest in the current period are all mostly Chicken adjustments, and you will see that in the detail of their section as well.\nAnd then we had a very unfortunate fire in our Sugar business. And just to cover that off here, the ZAR 39 million represents the cost in our system, which is largely our insurance access and other costs -- recoverable costs associated with it. But obviously, we are still in the phase of working through that process with our insurers. And so haven't booked any material upside other than the known loss and the acknowledgment of loss from our insurers.\nMoving on to slide, the next slide, 10, is really just to walk through in terms of our EBITDA performance due to headline earnings and then underlying headline earnings, again, not a significant amount to note here other than a pleasing continued reduction in our net finance costs. And then the share of profits is down on the prior period, largely by virtue of investment in Royal Eswatini Sugar, which is a forecast outlook, not dissimilar to our own in terms of a more challenged sugar period coming up.\nSlide 11 really just summarizes the unadjusted reported view of our numbers, and I'll put these slides in here to tee up what will be subsequent to the address by my colleagues in terms of their underlying divisional information. So Slide 12 then migrates that through the underlying adjustments by units. So that you can see a better perspective of the performance of the underlying business units, and as Paul has mentioned, a pervasive margin challenge that we have faced in this reporting period.\nSlide 13 is a very good picture in terms of -- we remain strongly cash generative. In the middle of that chart, you see that healthy free cash delivery. And yes, it's supported by a good top line in terms of the operating profit flowing through, but we also, for the period, had a good working capital result. And you can see the swing from the prior period, the underlying performance there remains a focus area for the business and a good one, but obviously significantly helped by the cutoff issue, which I'll cover off on the next slide.\nAnd then the only other comment to make on this is we're coming towards the end of our debt package moving into year 4 of a 5-year package, and there are some early repayment obligations coming at us. So we've had 1 in this period and 2 that will be in this H2 period coming up.\nSlide 14 is our busy working capital slide, but it does a good job in terms of capturing our continued focus in this area. Overall, for the comparative being 5.2% down in rand terms and whole 2% down as a percentage of revenue over the comparable period. So overall, a very good result.\nBy virtue of the later cutoff, we follow a retail calendar cutoff in our system. It meant that we cut off this period. And after year -- the calendar year close, we cut off on Sunday, the 2nd of January. What that meant for us is obviously a later window in terms of which we could get in receivables as well as honoring the obligation of all of our payables.\nSo if you want to look at it differently, it's a cleaner cutoff, more absolute cutoff for us, a good indication every now and again when this cutoff is as late as this. But it's part of the reason for the rand value and the days references improving. Hence, we always show at the bottom left, the adjusted debtors days reflection, which itself is suggesting is affected by the cutoff, but a pleasing and continued pleasing underlying book and remains an area that is well managed within the business. So despite the economic environment, it is a cleanly and well-managed book.\nSlide 15 then deals with our CapEx spend in the period and forecasted. We had previously signaled that we would see slightly a higher forecasted spends and those are slowly coming through, mostly related to catch-up spend in Sugar and Chicken. But what you're seeing here is also some expansionary CapEx sitting within our Baking business unit and Vector Logistics.\nSo a shift toward more expansion CapEx, but offer the same in terms of the working capital comment, the overall remains well managed when you judge the spend against a variety of metrics, whether they be percentage of free cash or percentage of revenue, they're still very acceptable references and our ultimate test is the see-through in terms of how this translates to an underlying improving return on invested capital, which is on the next slide, Slide 16.\nSo the put up of this at an interim is always a little bit challenging or more difficult to interpret by virtue of obviously, it being a rolling 12-month reference. So what you're doing is you're picking up the H2 or previous financial years and particularly evident when you look at Chicken and Vector's prior period reported ROIC numbers, which are very big negatives largely because that goes back to the period where we booked some of the impairments.\nBut overall, and then especially on an underlying basis, you see the improving trend, especially pleasing results coming through our Food division. Vector is improving as well in line with the trajectory of the planned consolidation of their networks post the Imperial Cold chain acquisition. So there's still a road to travel on that, but a pleasing improvement. And Chicken is -- quite clearly remains challenged. We are in the process of that turnaround. Marthinus will give us some color to that a little bit later.\nAnd then the last 2 slides, I've included in the deck, but I'm not going to spend any time with them. It really is how we find ourselves from a debt package perspective with our commitments and covenants and underlying, which are all in very good space. And so really nothing to highlight other than just to record them here for your benefit.\nI'm now going to hand back to Paul.\n\nP. D. Cruickshank\n\nCEO, RCL Foods Limited\n\nThanks, Rob. So then just moving on to the few division results. Just a reminder that the landing page of each of the business units does reconcile the actual reported results, underlying performance, as Rob has highlighted. And this is to give the market a clear view of the true performance of each of these business units.\nThe Food division, a reminder as well, comprises Groceries, Baking and Sugar and the statutory EBITDA growth, it was slightly down in the prior year but 1.9% ahead on an underlying basis.\nSo moving to Slide 22, which is the Groceries underlying EBITDA is 2.4% up on the prior year, primarily driven by growth in grocery, despite price increases implemented to counter high commodity costs. Strong volume recovery, albeit of a lower COVID base and heightened cost focus and consolidation of operations in beverages also contributed to improved Groceries result.\nIf we move to the next slide, with culinary categories within Grocery, talking about culinary categories in grocery, which has remained resilient despite the competitive trading environment and commodity input price pressure. Our Nola brand retained its market leadership position and a new economy proposition was launched under the brand, which is gaining traction.\nYum Yum's share growth is also pleasing considering the volume of imported peanut butter in the market, which does not attract the tariff whereas the raw peanut imports do. Albeit slow progress is still being made with [I Tech] in attempts to align the approach to peanut and peanut butter imports.\nFocus on the culinary category for the upcoming year, we're now delivering operating efficiencies and driving a pricing strategy that best mitigates the margin risk associated with the high input costs.\nIf we move to the next slide, in Pet Food, highlights a strong performance in our category despite the category being under pressure. This is reflected by growing market share position across most brands. Furthermore, branded Pet Food volumes grew by 9.2%, offsetting the loss of low-margin DOB business. More specifically, our premium retail and veterinary ranges are well positioned, delivering strong growth and our Optimizor brand continues to outperform in the co-op channel. A raft of exciting Pet Food innovation is ready to launch into the market once approved by the relevant government department.\nMoving to Slide 24. Pies operating unit has seen good recovery in volume on the back of strong promotional plan and growth coming in from innovation. The Pieman's Big Deal Pie and the newly-launched frozen Pieman's range in the retail channel. Margins have, however, come under pressure, primarily due to significant raw material cost increases. Selling initiatives ended mitigating margin risk and landing necessary price increases will be a key focus area.\nOur Beverages business has delivered improved performance from a cost perspective with the consolidation of the ultra-high temperature and fresh plant yielding the anticipated efficiency benefits. However, volume growth remains muted as the category struggles to recover post the COVID lockdown with significant distributors service-giving challenges compounding this in the most recent months.\nMoving to Slide 25. Although our Bread, Buns & Rolls operating units has seen strong volume growth during the period, particularly on bread, underlying EBITDA across the Baking business is down than the prior. Margins have been challenged as price increases landed have only partially offset wheat cost pressure. External milling volumes have been under increasing pressure as the business focused on protecting margins amidst the rising wheat price.\nOn Slide 26, the Bread, Buns & Rolls operating unit achieved good volume growth, largely on the back of the new depot rollout program, which is part of the bigger Sunbake growth strategy. Performance for the period was especially pleasing considering price increases necessitated by high raw material and diesel costs. The capital expansion project of Polokwane bakery is on track and will be commissioned before the end of the financial year.\nMoving to Slide 27, an improved operational performance through the milling results supported by the early benefits of the ERP planning system that is being implemented at our Pretoria site. The launch of a quick new coating product for the QSR market also contributed to the improved result. The Specialty operating delivered a disappointing result with margins under pressure due to increased input costs and a shift in mix. Therefore, improved efficiency throughout the plant consolidation initiative will be a key strategic focus area for the business over the next 2 years.\nMoving to Slide 28, Sugar produced a strong result aided by continued focus on our controllables, coupled with high international sugar prices and favorable local initiative factors. Slide 29 unpacks Sugar's result in more detail, which is underpinned by increased local demand, together with a 42% increase in the international sugar price, which improved export earnings for the period. The continued focus on cost control across the value chain also contributed to the strong results.\nOn the downside, cane quality and yields are temporarily affected by an aphid infestation and heat in the early part of the season. The fire that Rob has mentioned at Komatipoort sugar warehouse in October destroyed 40,000 tons of sugar, disrupted operations in the last quarter. The insurance process is progressing well and the business has appointed a team to design the optimal future storage solution for sugar.\nOn Slide 30, Molatek delivered a strong performance for the period, especially considering the prior period's exceptional results, which was bolstered by farmers rebuilding their herds post the drought. Higher raw material prices have started to put pressure on margins. And as a result, the business is focused on managing costs and driving an improved mix to mitigate this as much as possible.\nI will now hand over to Marthinus.\n\nMarthinus Petrus Stander\n\nMD of Chicken Division, RCL Foods Limited\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Paul. All right. Moving to the first slide, I think the key here is the low base. So if 1 looks at EBITDA performance, we're still talking relatively very small numbers. However, there was an improvement. And I think what bodes well for us is that the revenue was increased as a result of making more products, selling more and on the back of better prices in the market. We had a very challenging start to the financial year in the first 2 months, mainly as a result of Avian Influenza and also, obviously, the looting incident.\nMoving to the next slide. I think we've laid down some significant building blocks in supporting our business and particularly the turnaround. It will stand us in good stead. Specific reference to the regional management model, decentralized model, integrating the value chain elements within these 3 regions, feed, breed, agri processing, distribution and sales, creating that focus that 1 requires giving us the focus, particularly on the agri side of things. We are in essence an agri business. So your KPIs and the number of chicks that you can produce, number of eggs on the back of your attributability and livability is obviously key to lower cost.\nWe have introduced the new breed. It is a process that needs to roll out and will not only see that benefit really during calendar year 2023. It will be more significant in F '24 as this process rolls out. We see a significant reduction in imports, mostly driven by the Avian Influenza in Europe. I think AI is very much a very volatile space at the moment and the industry has embarked on programs to do proper surveillance. We see it still circulating in live birds and there's lots of AI in Europe. So one also looks towards contingency measures to be more prepared should one, again, have a very intense period during the next winter.\nMoving to the final slide. And here, we refer to specifically the external feed business of EPOL. It is a time, as Paul also mentioned, where 1 tries to protect margin in the absence of just growing new business, which one will have to discount given the current state of affairs in a prolonged bullish commodity market. One's best defense here is try and add value to your customers business and to focus on cost reduction.\nThank you very much. That's from my side. And I think I hand over to Chris.\n\nChristopher David Creed\n\nMD of Logistics Division, RCL Foods Limited\n\nThanks, Marthinus, and good morning, everybody. Moving to Slide 36. Just looking at the headlines, we see pleasing revenue growth to just over ZAR 1.8 billion, driven predominantly by the recovery in our foodservice volumes to almost pre-COVID levels, good growth in retail and L&A Zambia business consolidation for the first half, offset partially by the unrest in July.\nThe next bullet under headlines, I'll talk to the next slide, which is the good progress we've made on the final phase the Imperial Cold Logistics network. And then just commenting on the EBITDA, you can see a growth of nearly 12%, on an underlying adjusted basis with the impact of COVID regulating to about 9.2%, but pleasing nonetheless and on track with our turnaround.\nTurning to the next slide. We've spoken about the revenue growth, just focusing in on the final Phase 3 of our network integration. I'm pleased to say that our capacity builds are complete in some of the areas, namely Port Elizabeth late last year. Bloemfontein, we're just coming online with net capacity build now, expansion build and Durban and Polokwane due over the coming months.\nAnd by the end of the financial year, by June, we will have the integration complete. There has been some delays due to international supply chain challenges and COVID primarily, but the good news is that it's coming to finality. And now on the bottom of the page on the right-hand side, you can see our final end state of 7 sites and approximately 350 vehicles from where the far left, you had 14 sites and 445 vehicles. So it gives you a bit of a feel of the integration benefits that we'll get once done.\nAnd moving to the final slide and really a quite an exciting area for us. So our Empty Trips, which is our digital freight matching platform. As I've said previously, we've rolled out internally, and we're in the process now of rolling this out to the external market. We're excited by this opportunity, and we'll watch the space as we go into the external marketplace.\nAnd with that, thanks, Paul. I hand back to you.\n\nP. D. Cruickshank\n\nCEO, RCL Foods Limited\n\nThanks, Chris. Just moving to the prospects slide, I want to summarize the key themes have already been mentioned. But GDP growth in South Africa is expected to be less than 2% over the next 3 years. There's no doubt that the economic conditions will remain tough for the foreseeable future. And along with higher inflation places more pressure on the consumers. we are acutely aware of this. The current situation in Ukraine will contribute to a further rise in commodity costs, the extent and impact of which is currently unknown.\nSo just summing up quickly the outlook for the next 6 months, we expect a continued resilient performance from Groceries. Sugar will continue to focus on its operational efficiency as the season starts up. Though the full year results will not be at the record levels in the last fiscal year and are expected to be materially lower due to previously mentioned agriculture challenges. However, despite this, we still expect to see the second highest profit in the business unit's history.\nWhilst Chicken has made strides, as Marthinus has indicated and implementing its turnaround strategy is not yet at the right level of profitability, mainly due to the breed challenges which he explained in more detail. Vector has also made good progress with its turnaround and is well on track to deliver further once its capacity build are complete. We will continue to drive the managed separation of Chicken and Vector as a priority in a well-considered manner.\nThat wraps up the formal part of the presentation. Thank you for your attendance, and I look forward to hearing from you and over to you, [Karen]."

My name is Shelby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Royal Caribbean Group's Business Update and Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Michael McCarthy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McCarthy, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nVP of IR, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our business update and fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change.\nAlso, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our website and in our earnings release available at www.rclinvestor.com. Jason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow up with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results, an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason T. Liberty\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with all of you today in my new role here at Royal Caribbean Group. I'm very fortunate and humbled to take the helm of this incredible organization, which includes our industry-leading brands and the most innovative fleet in the world that is enabled by our incredible people and culture. I'm very much looking forward to building on the company's remarkable legacy and track record in the years ahead.\nI also want to congratulate and welcome Naftali as our new CFO. Many of you already know Naf, but for those who don't, I'm confident you'll enjoy working with him. Our mission at Royal Caribbean has been and continues to be focused simply and completely on delivering, every day, the very best vacation experience and doing so in a responsible way. It is awe-inspiring to see our team deliver on our mission each and every day.\nWhile 2021 was another challenging year for our company and the industry, it also marked our healthy return to sailing. In just a few short months and thanks to the incredible preparedness of our operating team and crew throughout the last 1.5 years, we have brought back more than 85% of our capacity into service and delivered extraordinary vacations and memories to approximately 1.3 million guests. I want to thank the hard-working people of the Royal Caribbean Group, both our crew and our shoreside employees, for their incredible efforts to bring back our fleet in such a short window and such a successful way. I am so proud and grateful for their efforts.\nI also want to thank our guests, travel partners, destination partners, suppliers, investors and financial partners for their steadfast support. As we navigate through this black swan event, we have focused intently on a successful healthy return to service, as you would expect. At the same time, we have been charting our course to get back to pre-COVID performance levels and beyond soonest. The combination of very strong secular and demographic trends, our leading brands, the most innovative and a growing fleet, our global sourcing footprint, a leading technology platform and the reshaping of our cost structure positions us exceptionally well to accelerate.\nLet me focus a moment on our healthy return to service. Since we resumed operations, our goal has been to making cruising one of the safest vacations anywhere in the world while providing an exceptional guest experience. We continue to demonstrate that in a very tangible way. As you heard me say, we have carried approximately 1.3 million guests since the restart, with about 2,500 guests testing positive for COVID-19, a positivity rate of 0.19%. This positivity rate is still a small fraction of what it is in society at large, and nearly all cases on board were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.\nOur rigorous health and safety protocols with 100% vaccination rate among our crew and close to 100% vaccination rate among our guests provide a safe environment where we can fulfill our mission of delivering amazing vacations. And our guests are responding by providing record Net Promoter Scores for us, exceeding their expectations. A few weeks ago, the prescriptive CDC conditional sale order expired, demonstrating the agency's confidence in the overall effectiveness of the health and safety protocols of the cruise industry. Our own protocols continue to go above and beyond anything the framework provided and what consumers will find in any hospitality setting. We continue to engage with the CDC and other public health agencies as we look to adjust our COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in response to the changing nature of the virus.\nOur healthy return to service plans anticipated twists and turns on our recovery path. We remain nimble in our approach adjusting to changes in the operating environment with a constant focus on our long-term strategy and success. As everyone is aware, the Omicron variant has impacted most parts of society as well as our operations. Since mid-December, we experienced an increase in the number of people testing positive for COVID onboard our ships. The good news is, is that in the last several weeks, cases on board our ships have been declining rapidly, and we now have returned to exceptionally low pre-Omicron levels. In fact, over the last 7 days, we have averaged only a handful of positive guest cases per cruise.\nWith the declining cases, operational challenges are also abating, so while the variant is not done, it appears that the worst is behind us. The timing of Omicron was particularly painful as a typical wave booking period begins in early January. So we do expect it will weigh on our performance in Q1 and, to a lesser extent, in early Q2. With the peak in Omicron now seemingly behind us, we have seen meaningful and sequential improvement in the booking activity week-over-week since the beginning of the year. In fact, in the last week of January, bookings returned to pre-Omicron levels, and we expect demand recovery to accelerate as the variant subsides. With that in mind, we have extended our sales and marketing activities for a delayed and extended wave.\nWhile Omicron created some short-term challenges and will likely delay our return to profitability by a few months, our recovery trajectory remains intact. We remain confident that we will have a strong spring and summer season with great demand for cruising, both domestically and internationally. The robust secular trends of experiences over things that has propelled our business in the past few years is now recovering towards pre-COVID levels. We have also seen a change in the mindset of consumers coming out of the pandemic, with the desire to travel and reengage with the world being stronger than ever. In fact, the U.S. traveler organization research confirms that leisure travel will continue to increase at higher levels than business travel. All of this, coupled with consumer resilience and easing travel restrictions, provides tailwinds for our recovery.\nAfter a storied 2020 and 2021, we are eager to move forward in this new year. As people are keen on taking a vacation, we are ready to make their vacation dreams come true in a healthy and safe environment. We expect 2022 will be a strong transitional year as we bring the rest of our fleet into operations and approach historical occupancy levels. We expect a net loss for the first half of 2022 due to the impact of Omicron and a return to profitability in the second half of the year.\nDuring 2022, we look forward to welcoming 2 additional new ships, Wonder of the Seas for Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Beyond for Celebrity Cruises. These exciting new ships will deliver amazing vacations to our guests and join 6 other new vessels that have entered our fleet since 2020. This is a key pillar to support our recovery. New hardware is an important driver of quality demand, extraordinary customer experience and exceptional financial performance. And just as important, it improves our sustainability as these are innovative ships that are much more energy efficient.\nWe remain focused on continuing to innovate our product and maintain our strong competitive advantage, setting the foundation for a strong recovery and long-term profitable growth. During the pandemic, we have had a relentless focus on reshaping our cost structure and rigorous capital allocation framework. We expect that the combination of new ships, growing yields and higher profitability will propel our financial performance and support our focus to return to pre-COVID financial metrics and beyond soonest.\nCorporate stewardship remains another key priority as we continue to progress across environmental, social and governance-focused areas. Climate change and reducing our emissions have been central to our environmental stewardship activities for decades. Last quarter, we announced our comprehensive decarbonization strategy and goals. We realize that the transition to net zero will not be easy, and to achieve our ambitions, we will rely on our culture of innovation as well as strong partnerships with governments, suppliers and shipyards to develop alternative and accessible fuels and technologies.\nAdditionally, in the past few months, we were named an employer of choice by Forbes and Glassdoor. And last week, we earned a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index, which rates corporate policies and practices that relate to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. These are recognitions we're proud of and they reflect our commitment to our employees.\nAll of this tells you that our business model is incredibly strong, and we have a track record of growing revenue, earnings and cash flow. Our formula for success is unchanged: recover and grow yields, enhance our margins, profitability and ROIC. To that, we added returning our balance sheet to pre-COVID levels. We have the best brands in each of our segments, the most innovative fleet in the industry, exclusive destination experiences like Perfect Day at CocoCay, a nimble and effective global sourcing footprint, a leading technology platform and most of all, the very best team, both at sea and on land. With that winning formula, I am confident about the recovery, and I'm very excited about the future of Royal Caribbean Group. And with that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?\n\nNaftali Holtz\n\nCFO, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jason. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to share how energized I am to take on this Chief Financial Officer role. I will focus my energy on continuing the accelerated recovery and returning our performance metrics to pre-COVID levels as soon as possible while positioning the company for long-term success.\nI will now turn to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. This morning, we reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter and $4.8 billion for the full year. It is important to note that Q4 results were better than our internal expectations, mainly due to continued strong onboard revenue performance and better cost management. The financial results for 2021 reflect the impact from the suspension of sailing in the first half of the year and the tremendous effort to resume cruise operations and accelerate the flywheel in the second half.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued our return, bringing 12 more ships back into operations, building the load factors and restarting our sales and marketing efforts, all to position the company for a successful 2022. Load factors for the quarter were 65% on core itineraries with month-over-month improvements. We are incredibly pleased with the progress we have made in the fourth quarter. Our total load factors grew from 36% in Q3 to close to 60% in Q4. In addition, the continued strong onboard revenue contributed to a 10% increase in total gross revenue per passenger cruise day compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Cash flow from our operating ships turned positive in the fourth quarter.\nNow I would like to discuss capacity and load factor expectations over the coming period. The Omicron variant caused short-term disruptions to the travel industry as well as our operations. As Jason just mentioned, our focus since we restarted operations has been to ensure the health and safety of our guests and crew, matching or exceeding guest vacation experience expectations and bringing the fleet up in a financially prudent way. With that in mind, we made the decision to cancel several sailings in the first quarter. We plan to operate about 7.7 million APCDs in Q1 or approximately 95% of our planned capacity. We expect that operating ships in the first quarter will be cash flow positive.\nOur capacity will further increase at the end of the quarter, following the delivery of the incredible Wonder of the Seas. Wonder will be introduced to the U.S. market in March before heading to the Mediterranean for the summer season. Due to the impact from Omicron on near-term bookings and cancellations, we expect load factors of approximately 60% on core itineraries in Q1 with month-over-month improvement within the quarter. We also expect to bring the rest of our fleet back to service in time for the lucrative summer season. We expect our load factors to continue to steadily increase month-over-month and approach historical levels in the third quarter.\nWhile we offer cruises in the vast majority of our key destinations, we continue to closely monitor both China and Australia. We anticipate Australia to open for cruising for its summer season, our winter time. With respect to China, it remains closed for cruising, and we have redeployed the remaining 2 ships planned in 2022 to other key markets. We remain optimistic that we can capture long-term growth opportunities in the China market.\nShifting to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.5 billion in liquidity, excluding the $1 billion issuance we completed in early January. We have ample liquidity to allow us to continue our recovery trajectory. During 2021, we focused on managing and improving our balance sheet. We reestablished access to the unsecured debt markets and successfully refinanced $2.3 billion of secured or guaranteed high coupon debt. Our plan is to continue with these balance sheet improvement efforts throughout 2022.\nIn early January, we issued $1 billion at 5 3/8% coupon, and we plan to use the proceeds to refinance near-term debt. In addition, we have taken and continue to take numerous actions to reshape our cost structure with a focus on further improving our leading pre-COVID margins. While these actions will improve our cost structure and margin profile, we do anticipate that inflationary pressures and some transitory costs related to our healthy return to service will weigh on this year's earnings.\nNow I'll provide an update on the demand environment and our 2022 sailings. For the last several quarters, we have seen new bookings improve from 1 quarter to the next. Bookings in the fourth quarter continued this positive trajectory, culminating in our biggest-ever Black Friday and Cyber Weekend from the U.S. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up more than 75% compared to the third quarter. As we restarted our brand marketing programs in Q4, we generated strong demand to support the book of business for '22 and '23.\nAs the Omicron variant began spreading in December, we experienced slower booking activity and higher near-term cancellations over the holiday period as many guests were testing positive before their cruise. But from the beginning of the year, we have seen meaningful week-over-week improvement in booking activity for both the first and the second half of '22. Second half booking activity has been recovering at a faster pace. In addition to that, we have seen a rapid improvement in cancellations over the same period.\nSimilar to our experience with the Delta variant, as Omicron cases are beginning to decline, booking activity has begun to pick up. In fact, in the last week of January, bookings have returned to pre-Omicron levels. The U.K., which is further ahead on the Omicron curve, has been on that improvement trajectory for several weeks. From a cumulative booking standpoint, our book load factors for sailings in the second half of this year remain within historical ranges at higher prices, both with and without the impact of FCCs. Load factors in the first half are below historical ranges as expected but are aligned with our anticipated load factors.\nOur customer deposit balance as of December 31 was $3.2 billion, an improvement of about $400 million over the past quarter despite the quarter-over-quarter increase in cancellations related to Omicron and significant revenue recognition, both of which reduced the customer deposit balance. Our customer deposit balance is only 5% lower than it was at the end of December 2019, with the entire difference driven by the first quarter sailings where we have less capacity. Our customer deposit balance related to bookings for Q2 forward sailings is higher than at the same time in 2019. Approximately 32% of our customer deposit balance is related to future cruise credits. Of the FCCs, approximately 50% have been redeemed thus far.\nLastly, turning to the outlook for 2022. Given the progress we have made ramping up operations and everything I said about the booking environment, the costs and the impact of the Omicron variant, we still expect to reach positive EBITDA and operating cash flow in late spring. We expect a net loss for the first half of 2022 and a profit for the second half of the year. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

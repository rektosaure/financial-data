[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2025 earnings results conference Call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Specifically, our discussion today of our expectations were the drivers of adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2025 and any commentary on expected adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2025 are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our third quarter 2025 press release, Centene's most recent Form 10-Q filed this morning and its 10-K filed on February 18, 2025. Additionally, other public SEC filings, which are available on the company's website under the Investors section.\nCentene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. While we'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2025 press release.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us to review our third quarter 2025 financial results and updated full year outlook. We are driving significant progress against the milestones we provided to investors in July, yielding a better-than-expected adjusted EPS result in the period. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.50, ahead of our previous expectation. In these results, our Medicaid business delivered anticipated HBR improvement in the period that was further aided by a positive 2025 retroactive revenue adjustment in our Florida business. SG&A and performance within our noncore segment were both slightly favorable. Net investment income was stronger than we previously expected, and we experienced a lower effective tax rate in the quarter than originally forecasted. .\nMarketplace experienced additional medical cost pressure in the last month of the quarter, but the segment still produced an on-track result for the period. In our Medicare segment, including MA and PDP performed in line with expectations we shared on our second quarter call. With 3 quarters of the year complete, we are increasing our adjusted EPS forecast to at least $2 up from our previous forecast of $1.75 per share. When we came to you in July with recalibrated earnings expectations, we laid out 6 key assumptions that bridged us from our April outlook to the $1.75 per share forecast. We'd like to take a moment to update you on how those 6 factors evolve during the quarter and are now treated within our new adjusted EPS outlook of at least $2.\nOne, relative to Marketplace morbidity and its corresponding impact on risk adjustment assumptions, we received the second tranche of Wakely data in September, improving our visibility with industry-level paid claims through July. We are pleased this data was consistent with our previous estimates, and we have, therefore, made no changes to our original full year assumption of a $2.4 billion pretax earnings impact within this new forecast. As a reminder, the next update from Wakely is expected in December.\nTwo, also in the forecast was $200 million we added to account for additional Marketplace medical spend in the back half of the year. Marketplace delivered an in-line result for the quarter, but given the uptick in utilization we saw in September, we are holding the remaining $125 million of this provision in Q4 and are adding another $75 million given the volatility around eAPTCs. While we may not need this cover as of now, we believe this to be a prudent posture given the landscape uncertainty that remains.\nThree, in July, we pointed to a 2025 Medicaid composite rate of roughly 5% based on the rates in hand at the time. With all scheduled rate adjustments now finalized, we expect the 2025 composite rate adjustment to be roughly 5.5%.\nFour, in July, we were targeting a second half Medicaid HBR of 93.5. Our third quarter Medicaid HBR was 93.4, which included $150 million in Florida Children's Medical Services program revenue, of which $90 million or 40 basis points was retro. As a result, we are now on a trajectory for a back half HBR of approximately 93.2.\nFive, we continue to expect the Medicare segment to deliver $700 million of pretax favorability relative to our April full year forecast. Medicare Advantage and PDP results in the quarter were consistent with our outlook, so no change to this expectation.\nSixth, we are also still on track to deliver $500 million in pretax benefit from SG&A. In fact, we performed slightly better than expected with administrative expense reduction in Q3. However, given the fluid nature of Marketplace open enrollment and the potential for additional enrollment activities surrounding eAPTC decisions, we are keeping the full year SG&A assumptions unchanged for the last quarter as of now.\nIn addition to those items from our Q2 bridge, we want to highlight investment income and tax rate performance in the quarter and how they impact our expectations for the remainder of the year. As mentioned earlier, Q3 investment income was stronger than expected. Gains were largely driven by onetime items and therefore are not expected to recur. We believe there may be opportunity to take some investment losses in the fourth quarter to improve the trajectory of investment income in 202. and we are providing flexibility in the guidance to do so if the opportunity arises.\nTax favorability in the quarter was driven by a lower tax rate, which was purely a matter of timing. Our view of the full year tax rate remains unchanged. While we continue to track and pull levers to address Medicaid cost trend and are similarly watching Marketplace utilization dynamics closely in this uncertain environment, we are pleased with the overall performance of the business in the quarter.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at the performance and trajectory of each core business line, starting with Medicaid. We were pleased to deliver 150 basis points of sequential improvement in our Medicaid HBR this quarter. While this was aided by improved revenue from the Florida Children's Medical Services contract, it also reflects fundamental improvement that is a direct result of the actions we described on our Q2 call, including rate advocacy, program changes, clinical management, network optimization and more aggressive fraud waste and abuse interventions, among others. Those efforts yielded tangible proof points in Q3.\nDuring our second quarter call, we identified 2 states, Florida and New York, where we were experiencing outsized Medicaid medical cost pressure. In Florida, you'll recall, we saw significant trend pressure in the CMS population as members receiving [ ABA ] services were transitioned into that sole-source contract. We engaged in constructive dialogue with the state and shared real-time data throughout the summer. In September, the state moved to address the underfunding of that program going back to February 1. Additionally, the state provided a rate update for the coming year that better reflects the underlying medical demand within that population.\nIn New York, we made real progress on the fraud, waste and abuse front, particularly in the behavioral health space. [ Fidelis ] team was able to terminate a provider group that engaged in suspicious billing practices and drove sizable excess medical costs at the expense of New York tax payers. The state has simultaneously taken several serious actions against the same provider. It's a great example of the confidence our state partners in [ Albany ] have in Centene. Through these and other performance improvement efforts, the New York team is currently on track to deliver meaningful HBR improvement in the back half of the year compared to Q2 results.\nWe continue to see trend in Medicaid with the same drivers we described in Q2, namely behavioral health with ABA, a primary contributor, home and community-based services with home health, the major driver and high-cost drugs. Though high-cost drug trend did show slight moderation in the period. As you heard on the Q2 call, we have organized enterprise-wide to address these dynamics and saw solid momentum in the quarter on those initiatives. A few examples. We've been actively working with states on solutions to address high-cost drugs and have seen multiple states make movements over the last quarter to implement drug-specific carve-outs and revised formulary decisions including 2 states who have reversed course on GLP-1s.\nAdditionally, our ABA Task Force successfully leveraged our multistate experience and unique breadth of data to drive important policy advancements with our state partners. One state established increased precision in ABA clinical service definition as well as more stringent supervisory and caregiver engagement requirements. This drove a 45% reduction to outlier payment rates which results in tangible financial improvement for the state's program and aligns members to higher-quality services. We are pleased to be making real progress on our Medicaid margin improvement agenda, but we are certainly not declaring victory.\nWith behavioral health still driving 50% of above baseline trend, we continue to aggressively pull levers internally to appropriately manage medical costs and advocate for rates that reflect the medical demand in the ecosystem. All part of returning Medicaid margins to a more normalized long-term levels. Despite the challenges we have navigated over the last few years, our commitment to serving low-income and underserved populations has never been stronger. We are pleased to be making progress against our financial goals and making good on our commitment to be responsible stewards of state taxpayer dollars, all while continuing to provide high-quality care and access to vital health care services for our members.\nTurning to Marketplace. From a membership standpoint, we ended the quarter with roughly 5.8 million members, slightly better than expectations. As you heard earlier, the business produced an in-line result inclusive of medical cost pressure in September. Given what we saw in September and the reality that we are supporting a population staring down eAPTC expiration and potentially the wholesale loss of affordable health care coverage next year. We felt it was prudent to provide for additional coverage in Q4 against a potentially more pronounced year-end utilization push.\nIn the meantime, we have been laser-focused on positioning our Marketplace book for 2026 margin expansion, and Q3 was the critical window for that effort. We were data-driven in the buildup of our revised rates, which ultimately averaged in the mid-30s, taking into account increased 2025 baseline morbidity, a prudent assumption for year-over-year churn and the combined risk pool impacts of expiring eAPTCs and program integrity measures. Consistent with what we shared in September, we were able to reprice our products for 2026 in states that cover 95% of our current membership and where we were not able to fully reflect the expected morbidity in the rates we took additional actions to minimize margin impact for the remaining membership. Those rates have now been officially approved and absent any late-breaking policy changes will drive open enrollment as it launches this weekend.\nCongressional dialogue around eAPTCs has obviously gained traction in recent weeks. The outcome remains uncertain. While our products are priced to support year-over-year margin improvement in the scenario where eAPTCs expire, we believe these tax credits offer critical support for hard-working Americans, small business owners and rural health care infrastructure, and we are hopeful Congress can find a path forward. In the meantime, we are ready to open enrollment with strengthened digital tools and well-trained call center personnel to aid members during this time of uncertainty. Regardless of the outcome, we remain confident in the long-term importance and viability of the individual health insurance market as a critical coverage solution for millions of Americans. As we move beyond this moment of policy evolution, we continue to see a greater role for this platform to support a more affordable, portable, individual insurance experience that we are excited to lean into and lead forward.\nFinally, Medicare. Both of our Medicare segment businesses performed well during the quarter, producing results consistent with our updated outlook provided this summer. Our reported Medicare segment HBR was 94.3, reflecting typical cost of care patterns within Medicare Advantage as well as the inverted seasonality of pharmacy costs within PDP, owing largely to changes related to the IRA. Note that these dynamics are even more pronounced now that PDP is half of our Medicare segment revenue. Medicare Advantage medical cost trend remains elevated compared to historic levels, but was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. PDP performance was consistent with our previous view and is now largely contained by risk corridors, providing for increased visibility into the fourth quarter as the corridor serves to narrow the band of outcomes through downside protection for the product.\nAEP is live, and we are actively enrolling members in our 2026 Medicare products. Margin recovery once again took priority over membership as we constructed Medicare Advantage bids but we are pleased with both the value proposition we are offering beneficiaries as well as our competitive positioning. We continue to invest in our member experience, providing enhanced digital tools and resources for members and prospective members. Dual eligible populations are a strategic focus for Centene, and we recently launched the first phase of our enhanced integrated duals model across 8 states as part of the broader transition of MMPs to integrated [ D-SNP ] effective January 1, 2026. We look forward to the opportunity to serve these beneficiaries as their needs and our capabilities continue to align and evolve.\nEarlier this month, CMS released 2026 Star ratings that impact 2027 financial results, and we are pleased to have generated another year of progress. During this cycle, we elevated our performance despite continued cut point headwinds to 60% of members in plans at or above 3.5 stars versus 55% from the prior year with roughly 20% of members in 4-star plans. These results demonstrate a true one Centene effort with the initiatives being planned and executed at every level of the organization and provide us with increased confidence in our ability to achieve breakeven pretax margin in 2027. We are proud of the Medicare Advantage Star score advancements we have achieved over the last 3 years but remain focused on the opportunity for continued improvement. In the near term, we are leaning into provider interoperability, multimodal member engagement and advanced BBC partnerships as levers for the future.\nOverall, we are pleased to have maintained strong Medicare segment results, including positioning PDP well to achieve results better than the 1% pretax margin guidance we began the year with and putting Medicare Advantage on an even stronger path to achieve breakeven in 2027. As we reflect on the quarter, we are pleased to have made material and necessary progress on Medicaid profitability and delivered solid results across the balance of the business. It is a testament to the resilience and discipline of this entire organization that we are able to raise the outlook today. And while a tremendous amount of work remains ahead of us, we intend to harness the positive momentum we have generated here in the third quarter to help power the balance of the year.\nLooking ahead, given that we will not be hosting an Investor Day in December, our plan is to provide detailed 2026 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in early February. In the meantime, we wanted to offer some initial comments on the major building blocks of our 2026 plan. In Marketplace, as we've shared, we were able to successfully take actions to account for baseline morbidity trend eAPTC expiry and program integrity impacts for 2026 across 95% or more of our membership. While the policy landscape remains uncertain, based on what we know today, we believe we have positioned the portfolio well for meaningful margin improvement in 2026.\nAs a result of thoughtful bid construction and disciplined management, we believe our Medicare Advantage business is also well positioned for margin improvement in 2026. PDP continues to outperform in 2025 and but you can assume we would not guide to a similar level of outperformance as we step into 2026, making this a year-over-year headwind as we set initial guidance. In Medicaid, in light of our now better-than-expected full year trajectory, we believe a prudent posture for 2026 is profitability consistent with our current full year outlook in 2025. Additionally, you should assume that a lower tax rate environment makes net investment income headwind and that our tax rate increases.\nOverall, we remain focused on driving margin improvement across the enterprise and delivering EPS growth in 2026. The current dynamic policy landscape has presented significant challenges in 2025 but also offers meaningful opportunity in the months and years to come. We have incredible runway ahead of us in the form of operational improvements, efficiency gains and margin expansion, all in service of our dual mandate to ensure quality health outcomes and serve as responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. None of this would be possible without the tireless work of more than 60,000 Centeners across the nation serving and supporting our nearly 28 million members. Thank you once again for showing up day in and day out in service of our mission.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported third quarter 2025 results, including $44.9 billion in Premium and Service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50. The GAAP loss per share of $13.50 was the direct result of a $6.7 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the quarter, more on that in a minute. Within the $0.50 of adjusted EPS, we had a temporarily low adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter, which contributed about $0.1, compared to an expected full year 2025 adjusted tax rate of 20% to 21%.\nLet's go through the drivers for the quarter and then map that to the full year. Starting with Medicaid. We are pleased to report a Q3 HBR of 93.4%, better than we expected for the quarter and heading in the right direction. Of the 3 previously discussed high-trending areas, Medicaid high-cost drug trends settled a little in the quarter and we successfully advocated for much improved revenue in our Florida Children's Medical Services or CMS business, where we've seen very high ABA costs. As Sarah covered, we received a net $150 million positive revenue adjustment in Q3 for the Florida CMS program for the 2/1 February 1 to September 30, 2025 period, of which about $90 million was retro to Q1 and Q2 2025. Retro piece was worth about 40 basis points on the Q3 Medicaid HBR.\nWe also made some progress in New York, but there's more work to do to further improve performance. Overall, given the Q3 result and momentum we are seeing from actions we have taken in 2025 we're a little ahead of our back half Medicaid HBR goal. On the rate front, the 9/1 to 10/1 cohort that represents about 28% of annualized premium averaged in the mid-5s consistent with the full year 2025 composite rate. We are focused on 1/1 and 4/1 rates, representing about half of our 2026 annualized premium revenue, and that advocacy is in process. Medicaid membership is at $12.7 million, and we would expect slight attrition over the next few quarters. Stepping back, we are pleased with the sequential progress in Medicaid with opportunity for improvement ahead.\nIn our Commercial segment, our HBR was on track for Q3 at 89.9%. Sarah indicated, in September, we received and evaluated the second run of marketplace Wakely data, which represents updated claims through July. Our review of this data is consistent with the $2.4 billion forecast change we described on the Q2 call. Also, our previous guidance had accounted for a pickup in Marketplace trend in the back half of the year, especially given the level of public discourse around the eAPTCs. We did see a pickup in utilization in September, including ER. As we assess risks and opportunities for Q4, we added another $75 million to our prior Marketplace medical expense forecast.\nThe more critical activity during Q3 was focused on 2026 rate filings and eAPTC education and advocacy. We sit here today based upon our rate filings in 29 states. We have priced for our estimates of one 2025 baseline correction; plus two 2026 forecasted trend; plus three, the impact of program integrity rules implemented in 2025 and those announced for 2026; and four, the sunset of eAPTCs. Unlike 2025, which is expected to run at a slight loss, we expect these pricing actions to support margin expansion in our Marketplace business in 2026.\nOur Medicare segment was also on track in the quarter. Medicare Advantage continues to show progress toward our 2027 goal of breakeven and we were pleased with the progress with the October Stars announcement as Sarah covered. Within PDP, while trends are still high in the non-low-income PDP population, they weren't as high as we had planned for in Q3. That's good for cash flow and forward forecasting, but is largely offset against the risk corridor receivable for current earnings purposes. As we discussed at a webcast conference during Q3, we are pleased with our 2026 PDP product positioning relative to the relevant benchmarks and direct subsidy estimates. More to come on the Medicare segment after AEP.\nOur adjusted SG&A expense ratio continues to be strong at 7.0% in the third quarter compared to 8.3% last year and 7.3% year-to-date compared to 8.3% year-to-date last year. This is largely due to growth in 2025 PDP revenue and continued leveraging of expenses over higher revenues coupled with good discipline. Given the amount of activity expected in Q4 with open enrollments and member communications, we are assuming for now that we will spend any remaining Q3 SG&A outperformance in Q4. You will notice investment and other income is up $79 million in Q3 compared to Q2. We had a few gains in the quarter plus temporarily higher cash balances than expected.\nAs we think about Q4, we may harvest some unrealized losses like we did a couple of years ago in Q4 as we think about reinvesting in higher yielding instruments for 2026 and beyond. So for now, we are assuming that Q3 investment and other income outperformance will be earmarked for that purpose. Overall, the fundamental business performance was good in Q3 relative to our July forecast. Our GAAP results, you can see a reduction or a write-down of about 38% of our goodwill during Q3. As we covered on the Q2 call, the drop in market cap required us to accelerate our annual goodwill evaluation into Q3.\nAfter going through an accounting promulgated and detailed review of our goodwill, we took a onetime noncash charge of $6.7 billion in our GAAP results. This has no impact on statutory capital, cash or adjusted EPS results. Our sole credit facility financial covenant is a debt to cap limit at 60%, and we sit at 45.5% on 9/30/25 after this write-down. The topic of the balance sheet, we had 0 drawn on our $4 billion revolver that has a duration until 2030. We also had a strong cash quarter with cash flow provided by operations of $1.4 billion in Q3, primarily driven by net earnings and the net timing of pass-through and other payments. Unregulated cash on hand at quarter end was $357 million.\nAs you can see in the 10-Q, we expect to receive net $200 million in dividends from subsidiaries in Q4. Medical claims liability totaled $21.5 billion and represents 48 days in claims payable, an increase of 1 day as compared to the second quarter of 2025. If we look at the full year 2025, we are increasing our 2025 adjusted EPS forecast from the previous $1.75 to at least $2 driven by early execution on the improved Florida CMS revenue. In 2026, we look forward to providing 2026 guidance on our next quarterly call in early February, once we have closed out 2025. But as you heard from Sarah, we look forward to growing adjusted EPS in 2026.\nThank you for your interest in Centene, and we can -- Rocco, we can open it up for questions."

Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We have a lot to cover this morning, so let me start by outlining a few key elements in my prepared remarks.\nFirst, I'll provide more detail on the Marketplace risk adjustment challenge we previewed earlier this month. including what happened and what actions we're taking to mitigate the financial impact with an eye to restoring the book to profitability in 2026.\nSecond, I will address the elevated medical cost trend that drove our higher Q2 Medicaid HBR results, how we are addressing it and an updated view on the positive progression of Medicaid rates. Third, I'll review our updated outlook for 2025. And finally, I'll share our perspective on how the policy landscape in the wake of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or OB3, and how that informs our view of 2026 and beyond.\nBefore we jump in, let's level-set with what we printed this morning. We reported second quarter results for 2025, inclusive of an adjusted per share loss of $0.16. We are disappointed by this performance and frustrated to have fallen short of the financial goals we set at the start of the year.\nOur primary focus is restoration of our earnings trajectory, and the entire team is unified behind that goal, operating with a sense of urgency and discipline as we work to improve performance across the portfolio and drive results that will generate tangible shareholder returns. As you will hear, we are aggressively taking actions to put our Marketplace business on a path to recovery and enhanced profitability for 2026.\nIn Medicaid, we have clear line of sight into what is driving our trends, and we are actively pulling the levers necessary to correct our trajectory. And finally, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving significant operational progress, paving our path to breakeven in 2027 and profitability in the years to follow.\nWith that, let's dig in, beginning with Marketplace. We reported second quarter Marketplace membership of 5.9 million members as the book continued to grow, driving more than $10 billion of commercial premium and service revenue in the period. Revenue in the quarter was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed shortfall in projected 2025 risk adjustment transfer revenue, generating a drag of approximately $1.2 billion in pretax for the segment.\nIn addition to the risk adjustment challenge, the underlying performance of our Marketplace business was impacted by higher levels of utilization. We have incorporated this elevated utilization into our full year 2025 outlook, which we will address in a few moments.\nNow let's talk about the risk adjustment challenge in a bit more detail. On July 1, we announced that, with information on approximately 72% of our membership, we were tracking to earnings pressure of $1.8 billion in 2025 as a result of a change in Marketplace risk adjustment transfer assumptions. This was based on data from Wakely, an independent actuarial firm that aggregates market growth and morbidity information on behalf of carriers on the individual marketplace.\nSince this announcement, we have received our additional files and spent meaningful time reviewing the findings. Based on the complete data set, we now expect full year 2025 Marketplace earnings to be pressured by $2.4 billion, which represents 100% of the membership impact.\nAnalysis of the full data confirmed a significant shift in the marketplace risk pool in 2025, which we now believe is primarily being driven by 3 things. First, a higher-than-expected percentage of healthy and/or low utilizing members left the marketplace during open enrollment, which was likely the result of program integrity measures that were introduced after 2024 pricing was finalized and implemented for the 2025 open enrollment cycle.\nSecond, new sign-ups to the market had higher morbidity, likely reflecting changes in the underlying member mix from redeterminations and the same program integrity guardrails deterring new healthy sign-ups in 2025. And third, a step-up in Marketplace utilization more broadly, combined with more aggressive provider coding, is likely driving higher in-year documented morbidity.\nTogether, these dynamics have shifted the morbidity of the market in some states as much as 16% to 17% year-over-year. Ultimately, Ambetter was underpriced for this morbidity shift. As a result, we now expect the product to run slightly below breakeven for the remainder of 2025 instead of within our target margin range of 5% to 7.5%.\nThis is obviously a disappointing outcome, but we are not taking it standing still. We immediately turned our focus to mitigating the impact of this pricing miss with the goal of returning the business to profitability in 2026. As of this morning, we have already filed 2026 pricing in 17 states. We expect to submit adjusted pricing files in up to 12 additional states within the next week and anticipate state certification of rates over the next months.\nBased on what we know today, we continue to believe that we will be able to reprice the 2026 portfolio to account for a substantial majority of our Marketplace membership, and our goal is to reprice 100% of the book. Importantly, our 2026 pricing adjustments account for the morbidity shifts we observed in the 2025 data, but they also account for shifts we now expect to see in certain markets in 2026, informed by the scale of our data and our unique ability to see correlations across the 29-state footprint. As a reminder, initial 2026 pricing was already set to current law of the land, which means we have accounted for the potential expiration of eAPTCs.\nIn addition to addressing pricing, we are actively looking at ways to leverage our position in the market to create more transparency around market dynamics earlier in the year. We are also engaged with the administration as they prepare to implement the next wave of program integrity measures to ensure the mechanics for open enrollment 2026 both achieve their goals and ensure that eligible members can readily access high-quality, affordable health insurance on the federal exchange.\nWhile the individual marketplace will be absorbing the impact of regulatory changes for at least 1 more cycle, it does not change the fact that millions of Americans rely on this critical infrastructure to access health care coverage. We remain committed to supporting our almost 6 million members in getting the care they need to keep themselves and their families healthy. And as we do so, we are focused on returning our marketplace portfolio to profitability in the short term and sustainable profitable growth over the long term.\nTurning to Medicaid. Our Medicaid portfolio also fell short of expectations in the second quarter, producing an unanticipated and unacceptable health benefits ratio of 94.9%. Driving this underperformance was a step-up in medical cost trend in 3 areas: behavioral health, home health and high-cost drugs.\nBehavioral health was the most significant driver of the quarter-over-quarter increase with ABA, or applied behavioral analysis, as an accelerating pressure point across a number of our markets. In response, we have formed enterprise-wide behavioral health and ABA task forces to further support our markets in aggressively managing this trend. Together, they are focused on aligning members to high-quality providers, educating state partners around evidence-based clinical guidelines, advocating for behavioral health specific rate adjustments and rooting out fraud, waste and abuse in service of better member outcomes.\nWithin the underlying ABA trend, the largest concentration of pressure was isolated to a single program in a single state. As a reminder, earlier this year, we inherited the ABA population in Florida within the Children's Medical Services contract, for which we are the sole source provider. That population transitioned with inadequate rates, and with the continuity of care provision, limiting the use of managed care strategies to effectively manage services and associated costs.\nThis provision lifted as of June 1, and we are already seeing the impact of clinical and administrative interventions. At the same time, we are also advocating with our state partner to address the underlying rate gap, both retroactively and prospectively.\nHome health was the next largest contributor to trend across markets in Q2 with home and community-based services, or HCBS, related to complex populations as the top driver. Here too, we are leveraging a cross-enterprise approach to select high-quality and high-integrity providers in this space and ensure states have sufficient data to inform both rate and policy decisions.\nWe saw HCBS pressure manifest in an outsized way in New York in Q2 due to rate insufficiency and state-driven program changes. As we saw this emerge, we deployed additional leadership resources to the New York market and are executing against a very clear road map to correct the overall trajectory, which is showing good progress as we move into Q3.\nICOS drugs were the final driver of the Q2 step-ups, with cancer drugs and gene therapies among the major categories contributing pressure. In addition to working with our partners to ensure clinical appropriateness for these treatments, we have also been ramping up efforts to educate our states on a sustainable cost containment, including through corridors or carve-outs. This is another place where the benefit of a 30-state Medicaid footprint means we can readily source best practices to inform solutions. And we are seeing states moving more quickly to make policy and program changes to better regulate this cost driver.\nIn addition to pulling these more direct levers, we are hyper-focused on securing rates that reflect current trends in order to deliver meaningful margin improvement for the Medicaid business. As a reminder, 88% of our Medicaid franchise gets rerated between 7/1/25 and 1/126. Over the last 18 months, we have demonstrated the ability to secure outsized rate increases and engage constructively with our state partners to infuse more real-time data into the process. We are activating that same playbook in light of this recent step-up in trend to push for faster rate correction.\nOur 7/1 and 9/1 rates have materialized better than our previous expectation, and we now expect a 2025 composite rate adjustment of 5% compared to 2024. This is stronger than the previous expectation of 4% plus.\nWe have important rate updates upcoming in our 10/1 states, including Florida, and we are already feeding current trend data to those states who will update rates 1/1/26 for 40% of our membership.\nDespite the current dislocation, we remain confident in our ability to secure rates that are sufficient to address the current acuity and health care demand within the Medicaid population and support sustainable margins over the long term.\nTurning to Medicare. PDP membership ended the quarter at 7.8 million members, roughly flat on a sequential basis. Our performance in this product exceeded our expectation in the period, allowing us to improve our outlook for full year results in PDP.\nThe PDP program absorbed a number of regulatory changes in 2025, and with half the year behind us, we are now more comfortable with the assumptions we made around the impact of some of these changes. While our outlook for the product remains prudent, PDP is providing some earnings upside relative to our previous outlook.\nMeanwhile, Medicare Advantage is making important progress on its path to margin recovery, thanks to effective 2025 pricing, an optimized footprint and continued operating discipline. To date, the book is running slightly favorable to expectations, and we continue to closely monitor components of costs such as outpatient surgery and pharmacy to ensure that we appropriately manage any evolving pressure.\nRelative to STARS, we are pleased with our continued performance improvements across multiple categories and particularly with gains we have seen in our clinical measures for members with chronic illnesses. We are still waiting for CAPS results and final cut points from CMS, but based on the data we have today, we still anticipate year-over-year progress in STARS. But challenging cut points may make our 85% target difficult to hit.\nAs a reminder, we anticipated cut point headwinds coming into 2025 and have built a path to our 2027 breakeven target that does not rely on further STARS improvement.\nBased on our performance in 2025 to date, as well as the advancements we have made and expect to continue to make relative to clinical interventions, SG&A and value-based care, we feel good about our path to break even in 2027 for Medicare Advantage and are pleased with the consistent progress we are making turning around this business.\nAs we think about the road ahead, our current forecast calls for full year adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $1.75. The following 6 items can help you bridge from our previous full year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.25, representing $4.55 billion of pretax to the $1.75. One as I mentioned earlier, we now estimate that the Marketplace morbidity shifts relative to our previous 2025 forecasts will create a $2.4 billion full year headwind to the 2025 pretax earnings. Two, also in Marketplace, we have built in an additional $200 million in pretax margin pressure from expected back-half utilization, including the impact of members seeking care in advance of the expiration of eAPTCs.\nThree, in Medicaid, we reflected the rate increases we know for 7/1 and 9/1 but have been balanced about our assumptions for the 10/1 cohort. Four, we have also assumed that we will continue to have trend pressure in the back half of the year such that the Medicaid HBR in the second half is approximately 93.5. The overall change in full year Medicaid HBR represents an approximate $2.1 billion headwind on pretax earnings compared to our prior forecast.\nFive, we expect the Medicare segment to deliver approximately $700 million in pretax favorability in our -- compared to our prior forecast, largely driven by PDP but supported by better Medicare Advantage results as well. Embedded in this $700 million is the expectation of continued specialty trend in PDP and slight outpatient pressure in MA.\nAnd finally, through continued aggressive SG&A management and natural leverage on growth, we expect to deliver an approximate net $500 million in pretax earnings in the buildup to $1.75 compared to our prior forecast.\nAs we think about variation to that forecast, we believe the largest swing factor that could pressure the $1.75 would be a further acceleration of Medicaid trend in the back half of the year. To frame the downside for you, if we made no progress on HBR in the back half of the year compared to the first half, that could push the $1.75 as low as $1.25.\nWith respect to upside to $1.75, we have tangible momentum in Medicaid on rate updates and policy changes, progress on clinical interventions and network design and increasingly effective initiatives to stamp out fraud, waste and abuse. The impact of that work could lead us to a better result than 93.5% in the back half of the year. And as a reminder, every 10 basis points of back half HBR improvement is $45 million in pretax.\nIn Marketplace, we will get updated market morbidity data at the end of September and December, which could indicate we don't need the full $2.4 billion change in the Marketplace forecast. As the next few months progress, we will also have a better view on whether the additional $200 million provision for Marketplace trends was necessary.\nAnd finally, we will continue to pursue strategic SG&A opportunities as we look to rightsize the business for 2026. All of these factors could drive results higher than $1.75.\nThere are a number of very near-term milestones that will better inform our view of the full year outlook, including July and August results, 10/1 rate updates and the next tranche of [ Wakely ] data, all of which are expected by the end of September. We look forward to providing updates on our outlook as we gain additional visibility into these key inputs.\nWith that, let me take a moment to talk about 2026. We fully expect to deliver margin improvement in our 3 core lines of business in 2026 relative to the current 2025 forecast. Let's dig into that in more detail.\nWe believe we are on track to reprice our Marketplace business for meaningful margin improvement in 2026. While the last month has been incredibly challenging for this business, the team has far more clarity on the trend and market morbidity dynamics of 2025, as well as the insights embedded in that data that foreshadow 2026 dynamics. We have integrated this view into our 2026 refiling decisions and are making excellent progress against our goal to reprice 100% of the Marketplace book.\nIn Medicaid, we now have far more transparency about the drivers of cost and trend across our portfolio and are in command of the levers to correct our HBR trajectory as we head into 2026 and beyond. With 88% of the book rerating over the next 6 months, momentum around policy changes and enterprise-aligned execution on key initiatives, we are confident we can meaningfully move the Medicaid HBR in the right direction over the next 12 to 18 months.\nAnd finally, armed with strong rates and operating discipline, our Medicare Advantage business will continue to make solid progress in 2026 on its path to breakeven in 2027. Our industry is always evolving, and it is our job as a business to evolve with it. We have spent the last 3 years fortifying our platform. And over the coming months, we will pressure-test each of our markets for the future conditions necessary to support sustainable, profitable growth. We will harvest additional synergies across the platform, lean harder into places we can leverage our unique size and scale and work to ensure we have the strongest and most resilient platform to support the new normal that lies ahead.\nTo that end, a comment on the policy and legislative landscape. We view OB3 as having established a new and stable policy floor for our programs, and we are actively developing a multiyear implementation strategy. Many of the Medicaid provisions include runway for implementation, allowing us to leverage the strong partnerships we have at the state level to help maximize the impact of taxpayer dollars and maximize coverage for vulnerable members.\nOn the Marketplace side, as you heard, we have the benefit of an early look at program integrity impacts and are baking that into our revised 2026 pricing. While we expect to see a contraction of the individual market heading into 2026, regardless of what happens with eAPTCs, just on the other side of that is a more stable market for individual and family coverage.\nMedicare likely has another wave of policy changes coming from CMS aimed at maximizing efficiency and integrity across the program, and we are tracking those closely as we build back that business. This clarity allows us to firmly plan for the future. And our confidence in the staying power of Medicaid, Medicare and the individual marketplace is as strong as it has ever been.\nBy staying focused and delivering on our mission of transforming the health of the communities we serve one person at a time, we believe we can command a durable, differentiated position in a key market and deliver meaningful value to our members, our stakeholders and our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Drew for some additional detail on the financial results.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported second quarter 2025 results, including $42.5 billion in premium and service revenue, and a disappointing adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.16. Let me build on what Sarah covered regarding what happened and, more importantly, what actions we are taking.\nLet's start with Marketplace, where Sarah covered a lot of ground. So let me give you a click deeper into one of the primary drivers observed in the data we received in late June and then tie that to the relevance for refiling 2026 rates.\nWe have found a high correlation between increasing 2025 morbidity in a given geography and the degree to which there is disruption in the 2 low-cost silver plans from 2024 to 2025 and whether or not that geography was in a state-based exchange or federal exchange for those 2 years. In other words, where there was a change in the 2 low-cost silver plans in the federally facilitated exchange, which would require the member to take an action in order to maintain a $0 premium, we believe the 2025 program integrity provisions, such as a 3-way call with CMS or social security verification, negatively shifted the risk [ both ] and disproportionately reduced 0 or low utilizers from the market in 2025.\nThis same phenomenon appears to have also reduced the entry of similar new members across all federally facilitated exchange, or FFE, markets compared to 2024. As Sarah mentioned, the morbidity increase was up as much as 17% in states with significant low-cost Silver disruption. Conversely, in an FFE geography with no disruptions in the 2 low-cost Silver plans, the members could auto-renew with their carrier for 2025 without much of a hassle.\nWhy is this important? Because based on what we can see across our 29-state footprint, we can form an expectation of what degree of morbidity lift may be coming in 2026 when all members will have to go through the new program integrity steps and validations to ensure eligibility for 2026 Marketplace. This has meaningfully influenced our 2026 pricing approach that Sarah described. As of this morning, we have submitted 17 refilings and expect to wrap up the remaining states in the next week or so, with the approval process expected in August.\nAs we sit here today, we expect to make meaningful upward 2026 rate adjustments reflecting this data across our Marketplace footprint.\nIn Medicaid, Sarah covered the trend drivers, including the acceleration of behavioral health, especially ABA and other related counseling therapies in Q2. We are working with state partners to get rates corrected for this and, in some cases, push for retro premium adjustments for program changes such as Florida Children's Medical Service where we are the sole source carrier and where there are inadequate risk adjustment mechanisms such as in New York.\nIn addition to the 7/1 and 9/1 positive rate updates Sarah provided, we are working with our state partners to drive policy improvements across a number of states. One example being pharmacy management responsibility returning to the Medicaid plans in 1 of our states in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to directly manage the cost. We're also executing on initiatives designed to keep health care affordable, including clinical interventions, payment integrity and choosing the right network partners.\nLet me go a little bit deeper on PDP as a follow-up from the Q1 call. Now that we have 2 quarters of PDP data, we can better forecast the trends for the remainder of the year. Even though we still see very high specialty pharmacy trends in our non-low income cohort, we are into the 90% CMS, 10% payer part of the risk corridor. This should provide us with earnings protection and reasonable predictability, though we will continue to build a receivable from CMS, which will be increasingly visible in our cash flows in the back half of the year.\nAnd as Sarah mentioned, our Medicare Advantage business is ahead for 2025 and on track for our goal to breakeven in 2027.\nMoving to consolidated enterprise topics. Cash flow provided by operations was $1.8 billion for Q2, primarily driven by improved timing on pharmacy rebate remittances. Unregulated cash on hand at quarter-end was $234 million. We do not have any further 2025 share buyback in our current forecast, but we'll remain open to opportunistic buybacks as we continually assess market conditions and changes in our cash positions.\nOur medical claims liability at quarter-end represents 47 days in claims payable, a decrease of 2 days as compared to the first quarter of 2025, driven by the timing and types of claims as well as the impact of state-directed payments. And as a reminder, 2025 DCP is structurally lower than 2024 DCP due to our PDP revenue increase resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act and the speed at which pharmacy claims complete compared to medical claims.\nMoving to our outlook for 2025. With the visibility we gained in Q2, we pressure-tested each business, operational measures, trend drivers and SG&A. The result is a forecast that equals $1.75 per diluted share of adjusted earnings with swing factors on both sides, as Sarah laid out.\nA few more miscellaneous items that might answer a couple of questions in advance. One, we expect our full year adjusted tax rate in our forecast to be around 19%, which could vary depending on the actual level of pretax earnings. Two, given our market cap change, coupled with the passing of the OB3 in July, we will be going through a goodwill evaluation and test in the third quarter, which prevents us from being able to reconcile prospective adjusted EPS elements to a GAAP equivalent.\nAnd three, our premium and service revenue outlook for 2025 has increased to approximately $172 billion, including approximately $89 billion in our Medicaid segment, $41 billion in our Commercial segment, $37 billion in the Medicare segment and $5 billion in Other. There is substantial future earnings power in this revenue base.\nComing back to the big picture. There's a real opportunity to make meaningful margin improvements, and these are good long-term businesses. Yes, we have to navigate a major unanticipated shift in the marketplace risk pool in 2025, as well as the dislocation between Medicaid rates and underlying medical costs plus regulatory changes in 2026 and beyond. But these are important and relevant long-term businesses critical to serve and provide value to economically-challenged and medically-complex members and our government partners. This is fixable. We look forward to demonstrating improvements ahead.\nThank you for your interest in Centene. And Rocco, please open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2025 earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our first quarter 2025 press release, Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed on February 18, 2025, and other public SEC filings, which are available on the company's website under the Investors section. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.\nWe will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2025 press release.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us as we review our first quarter results and updated full year 2025 outlook. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.90, consistent with the expectations we shared with investors last month. Our full year 2025 adjusted EPS expectations remain unchanged at greater than $7.25. We have increased clarity on the components of our $7.25 floor and have moved some of the underlying metrics as a result. Drew will cover these and other details of the quarter in a moment.\nUncertainty and change are not new to Centene, and we are managing the business well while navigating a dynamic policy landscape. Relative to the active national dialogue around health care policy reform, we believe a few things are important to note. First, we do not see broad support for benefit cuts in Medicaid from either the White House or from Congress. In fact, over the last few months, we have witnessed an increase in [indiscernible] Republican members objecting to major Medicaid reforms. While there is building momentum around work requirements within the expansion population and opportunities to drive better efficiency in the system for beneficiaries and the states, we believe that large-scale benefit cuts and significant policy changes will present challenges for the reconciliation process. Second, there is growing Bipartisan recognition in Congress that the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits must be addressed before they expire at the end of the year. Recent survey conducted by leading Republican [indiscernible] found that 78% of swing voters support extending health care premium tax credits for working families. The criticality of these tax credits for Republican voters, small business owners and our existing rural health care infrastructure as well as the potential of the even individual marketplace to serve as a platform for ICHRA growth has taken root for many Republican congressional leaders. Congress is scheduled to return from recess next week, and we expect activity focused on driving the contours of a reconciliation bill as the first order of business.\nPublic and lawmakers are targeting Memorial Day for a reconciliation bill, but much will depend on the consensus building process.\nBeyond reconciliation, the next big order of business will be government funding due to expire at the end of Q3. We anticipate this could be another vehicle where health care issues are addressed. Amid this backdrop, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives while advocating for sound health care policy. We have demonstrated the ability to be successful under multiple administrations and expect nothing less as we navigate the next 4 years.\nTurning to the core business. Medicaid took important steps forward in the quarter as we continue on our path of margin recovery, including better alignment of rates and member acuity in more geographies. As we noted back in February, approximately 40% of our Medicaid revenue received refreshed rates at the start of the quarter with an average increase of 4.5%. These rates contributed to underlying improvement in the performance of the book. However, the full impact of this improvement was masked in the quarter by a more active flu season than we anticipated. In Medicaid, flu and ILI drove $130 million of incremental medical expense in the quarter beyond our initial expectations, largely offsetting the underlying MLR improvement we experienced.\nOn the rate front, our discussions with state partners continue to be constructive and to benefit from increasingly complete data, demonstrating the acuity shift the industry has seen over the last year as a result of the tailing redetermination process. We continue to believe that Medicaid will ultimately return to pre-pandemic margin levels as we work through the coming rate cycles and engage with our members to deliver high-quality, low-cost outcomes.\nOn the business development front, we delivered several key Medicaid contract wins since the start of the year, underscoring the strength and competitiveness of our unique service model. Centene was selected by the State of Illinois to continue providing Medicare and Medicaid services for duly eligible members through a fully integrated DSNP. the DSNP program will provide services and support statewide for members who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid as well as duly eligible MLTSS members. The state of Nevada, our Silver Summit Health Plan has once again been selected by the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services to serve its Medicaid managed care program. For the first time, the program will include expansion of Medicaid managed care into rural and frontier service areas, allowing us to grow our footprint across the state. These wins are testimony to Centene's expertise in both high and low acuity populations, making us a partner of choice in states across the nation.\nOur Medicare segment performed in line with expectations during the quarter, as we advance our Medicare Advantage business on a path toward breakeven in 2027 and manage the evolution of Medicare Part D amidst significant program changes due to the Inflation Reduction Act. As you saw from this morning's press release, we have added $1 billion of annual revenue to our outlook for 2025 as Medicare Advantage membership is shaping up to be a little stronger than we previously anticipated. This better-than-expected membership is being driven by improved retention, and we are pleased to be able to attract and retain lives through our strengthening Medicare value proposition.\nAs we plan for 2026, we were pleased to see the inclusion of more recent claims data in the final 2026 Medicare Advantage rate calculation, resulting in rates that better reflect the medical cost trend we've seen in MA over the last 2 years. There will still be gaps to close between rate and cost across certain geographies, but this step forward was important as we look to deliver valuable benefits to seniors and return our business to breakeven in 2027.\nIn addition to rate, the critical levers we are pulling to drive to breakeven in Medicare Advantage are STARS results, value-based clinical initiatives and operational efficiency through SG&A reductions. On the STARS front, we continue to see momentum. And while a number of components remain outstanding, we are projecting underlying improvement across chapters. That said, we are conscious of the fact that cut points, or the relationship between absolute scores and corresponding star ratings have become more difficult due to recent methodology changes and variability in competitor performance. With that in mind, we took on the challenge to derisk our STARS outcomes for 2027 and to build a plan that supports our 2027 breakeven trajectory across the range of projected outcomes expected this October.\nThrough the identification of cost-saving opportunities and operational levers, we have increased confidence in our ability to generate breakeven results in 2027 with our current Star ratings where 55% of members in 3.5 star plans, with improvements on those results giving us increased flexibility and potential upside in our breakeven path. As always, rates for 2027 will be an important input, and we will continue to advocate for program funding that supports the critical health care needs of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across the country.\nFinally, our Commercial segment, which includes our Marketplace business, grew nicely during the first quarter as new enrollment and retention were both stronger than previously anticipated. The impact we experienced relative to the reintroduction of integrity programs like failure to reconcile, or STR, was more muted in the period than we originally forecasted, contributing to better-than-expected member retention. This membership strength is reflected in the full year revenue increase we issued earlier this morning. Recent CMS guidance suggests that ultimate STR notifications and actions won't be taken until this summer, suggesting we won't see the full impact of this member shift until Q3. As a reminder, we have these and other seasonal member attritions already baked into our full year forecast.\nThe other policy news, CMS issued the marketplace integrity and affordability proposed rule last month, including standards for the health insurance marketplaces as well as for health insurers, brokers and agents who connect millions of consumers to affordable individual coverage. We are engaging with CMS on these policy proposals and working to model the potential impact of each component. The only major provision that would impact 2025 would be the discontinuation of the continuous SAP for members below 150% of the FPL. The rest, depending on what gets finalized, would influence market and membership dynamics beginning in 2026.\nWith respect to enhanced ABTCs, we remain optimistic that legislators will act to preserve these tax credits given the value they create in health outcomes and market stability. But we are preparing for a range of potential outcomes as we establish plans for marketplace pricing and product positioning in 2026. While there are a number of factors that could impact the Marketplace operating landscape over the next year, as a category leader in this business, we look forward to navigating the near-term dynamics from a position of strength, and recalibrating our book with a focus on margin and long-term profitable growth.\nStepping back, as we survey the performance of our diversified portfolio, we are pleased to reiterate our full year 2025 adjusted EPS outlook of greater than $7.25 and a mid-sector volatility that is unmatched in recent history. With 3 months under our mill, we are prudently guiding with an element of conservatism to acknowledge at this early stage in the year, the many moving parts we are managing.\nWe remain excited by our long-term trajectory, including the attractiveness of our end markets, our positioning to capture meaningful market share and the associated earnings power and the exceptional send team that is mobilized and executing against these opportunities, committed to delivering value to our shareholders and transforming the health of the communities we serve one person at a time. With that, I'll turn it over to Drew to cover the quarter and full year view in more detail.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported first quarter 2025 results, including strong premium and service revenue of $42.5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.90 in the quarter, a good start to 2025. While we manage the company as a diversified portfolio, let's go segment by segment for some insights of how we've been able to manage various tailwinds and headwinds to yield a strong aggregate result so far in 2025.\nMedicaid membership was stable and right in line with our expectation of 12.9 million to 13 million members. The Medicaid HBR, excluding excess influenza related costs, was approximately 93%, showing some progress compared to 93.4% in Q4 of 2024. You'll see the print at 93.6%, including about $130 million of Q1 influenza-related cost above our expectations. At a conference in March, we had also cited $130 million of excess influenza costs through February, and consistent with CDC data, influenza settled down as we got into March. Fundamentally, we continue to make progress matching rates and acuity. The key word being progress, not completion. For instance, a 4:1 rate cycle representing about 11% of Medicaid revenue yielded an approximate 5% rate increase, those still inadequate for that 4.1 cohort in areas such as LTC, home and community-based services and emerging high-cost drugs. So progress, but more work to do as we get through 2025 and into 2026.\nOn our entire Medicaid book, we are projecting a full year composite rate increase at 4% plus.\nMedicare Advantage and PDP both outperformed on membership. We retained more membership than expected during the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period, which bodes well for long-term earnings power. This is contributing $1 billion to our 2025 premium and service revenue guidance increase. PDP ended the quarter at 7.9 million members, strong growth from 2024.\nMedicare segment HBR was 86.3% in the quarter, which, as we covered in past discussions, is expected to follow an inverted slope line compared to 2024 due to the Inflation Reduction Act program changes. So a lower Medicare segment HBR and higher earnings early in the year and a higher HBR and lower earnings later in the year.\nWithin the Medicare segment, both Medicare Advantage and PDP businesses were on track in the quarter. And you'll see an intra-year increase in the Medicare Advantage PDR, premium deficiency reserve, that was planned for and is solely related to the sloping of earnings during 2025. So no change in our view of Medicare Advantage earnings for 2025.\nCommercial membership was very strong in the quarter, not just during open enrollment for 1/1, but also in February and March. Q1 Commercial segment HBR at 75.0% was a little higher than last year's 73.3%, driven by 1.9 million new marketplace members in Q1. These members are utilizing a little more than last year's new members. But because it's so early in the year, we are not yet recognizing a matching offset for risk adjustment. We'll know more when we get the first Wakely file in late June, early July.\nGiven top line performance in Q1, and even as we forecast net membership attrition throughout the rest of the year, we are adding $5 billion of premium revenue to 2025 guidance related to marketplace.\nMoving to other consolidated P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 7.9% in the first quarter compared to 8.7% last year, which decreased due to continued leveraging of expenses over higher revenues and good discipline. Cash flow provided by operations was $1.5 billion for Q1, primarily driven by net earnings. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.8x at quarter end. Our medical claims liability totaled $19.9 billion for Q1 and represents 49 days in claims payable, a decrease of 4 days as compared to the fourth and first quarters of 2024, driven by significant revenue growth in the PDP business. The decrease in days was expected given the mix impact of our PDP business, which will be a $16 billion plus business in 2025 versus $5.2 billion last year.\nAs I'm sure you know, pharmacy claims complete much faster than medical claims, causing the mix-related mathematical reduction to DCP.\nLooking at the full year, we are pleased to reiterate greater than $7.25 of adjusted diluted EPS. As you've heard, the theme of the quarter was strong premium revenue growth and stronger-than-expected membership. Accordingly, we are increasing premium and service revenue guidance to a midpoint of $165 billion, up from $159 billion.\nWe are also recalibrating the consolidated HBR to reflect this growth and a couple of other items. 50 basis points is driven by: one, incremental Q1 growth in Marketplace, with that growth assumed for now to be at a lower-than-average margin level; two, a full year Medicaid HBR in the mid- to high 91s, inclusive of flu from Q1; and three, very high utilization of specialty drugs in non-low-income PDP members. While most of this is covered by the PDP demo risk corridor, some of it makes it to our P&L. When coupled with SG&A outperformance in PDP, we are still on track for a PDP pretax margin in the 1%.\nWe are also lowering the consolidated adjusted SG&A ratio midpoint by 45 basis points given strong performance in Q1 and based upon our 2025 growth and mix of business. And we lowered investment income by $100 million as we reforecasted cash balances and calibrated potential rate cuts. So on track for 2025 at this early point in the year, with a very strong top line creating attractive long-term earnings power.\nNow a few educational comments on 2026. Since much of what we do in 2025 sets us up for success in 2026. On Marketplace, there are 2 items that, if finalized, would impact the 2026 market size and risk pool that need to be reflected in 2026 pricing. Potential expiration of APTCs is one that we've discussed heretofore. The second item, as Sarah mentioned, is the new Marketplace integrity and affordability proposed rule released in March with provisions that would impact 2026. Looking at actuarial studies, these 2 items combined may cause high single-digit price increases, and that's before before any baseline trend adjustments, pricing forward trend for 2026 and potential tariffs. While the proposed rule changes seem likely to get implemented, we are still optimistic about lawmakers seeing the merits of continuing EAPTCs, and over half of our states have agreed to accept 2 sets of rates 1 with enhanced APTCs and 1 without, in case there's clarity by July. So rest assured, we are on top of adequately pricing for these matters.\nPDP, the high specialty drug trend being partly driven by pharmacy industry behavior will need to be reflected in 2026 bids, along with the assumption that the demo risk corridor will not be repeated at the same protective level. And we'll also be thinking about potential tariff impacts when making bid decisions. Remember, our discussions last year about the PDP direct subsidy substantially rising in 2025 due to forecasted IRA dynamics, that landed right where we thought it would. No, we expect another year of a large direct subsidy increase maybe to over $200 compared to this year's $142 because of the intentional and maybe unintentional cost consequences of the IRA. So again, we are focused on making adequate pricing moves, coupled with a higher PMPM yield as we think about being responsible in our 2026 decisions being made in the next month or 2.\nWe are very pleased to deliver a strong Q1 and more earnings power for the future. Thank you for your interest in Centene, Rocco, open the line up for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2024 earnings results conference Call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene will host this morning's call which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our fourth quarter 2024 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section.\nCentene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP can be found in our fourth quarter 2024 press release. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. As an enterprise, Centene is stepping into 2025 with a clear strategy, compelling embedded earnings power and positive momentum within each of our lines of business. We have delivered significant operational improvements and see exciting opportunity ahead as we continue to modernize our platform, automate our administrative processes through the deployment of AI and leverage our unparalleled data to create insights that make our business better, improve the quality of health care for our members and transform how the health care system serves millions of Americans.\nToday, we reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80 and full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $7.17. The strong results that demonstrate the durability of our earnings power and position the company to execute against our strategic goals in 2025.\nDriven by better-than-expected results during the Medicare annual enrollment period and a program expansion in Medicaid, we are lifting our full year 2025 revenue guidance by $4 billion. Our outlook for full year 2025 adjusted diluted EPS remains unchanged as greater than $7.25, and we are pleased with the trajectory we are on at this early stage in the year.\nTo that end, let's talk about the opportunities in each of our business lines and how we are positioned for 2025. First, Medicaid. Today, we serve 13 million Americans across our Medicaid portfolio, offering critical access to vital medical services and support for some of this country's most vulnerable and complex populations.\nPost-COVID era eligibility redeterminations generated significant membership transition within the Safety Net program, but that chapter is now coming to a close. In 2025, we expect improved membership stability and a gradual return toward equilibrium with respect to rates and the risk profile of our members.\nWe continue to have constructive dialogue with our state partners, providing us with confidence in our ability to command rates that will support a return to target Medicaid margins. This is visible to a strong result for 1125 effective rates where we were able to achieve a mid-4% composite rate adjustments.\nWe continue to expect a full year 2025 composite rate adjustment of 3% to 4%. While we have been focused on supporting our members and state partners through the redetermination process, Centene's local Medicaid teams never stopped working to develop innovative care programs and solutions to promote access for our unique member base.\nFor Centene, transforming the health of the communities we serve means [indiscernible] care to our members, ensuring it is local, integrated and sustainable and working to influence positive health outcomes for our members as early as possible in the care journey in some cases before they are even born.\nTo this end, in Nevada, we are actively working to address the challenges of rural health care access for expected moms. Our Silver Summit team is distributing tablets to support increased prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits for mothers in rural counties. We have also sponsored telehealth training with a particular focus on postpartum behavioral health support.\nAnother great example of innovative programming comes from our Meridian team in Illinois, where we are taking a food as medicine approach to supporting members with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Members have access to a 12 comprehensive program that includes nutrition counseling along with 4 weeks of medically tailored meals, followed by 4 weeks of healthy food boxes followed by 4 weeks of fresh produce vouchers. The goal is to build and sustain the changes in eating habits that will support long-term hypertension control.\nAs we move through 2025, we are looking forward to turning the page on the determinations era, returning to overall Medicaid program stability and working closely with our state partners on innovations that deliver not only health care but also better health within our communities.\nTurning to Medicare. We are pleased to be generating material progress within our Medicare business. The most recently released Star results published during fourth quarter 2024 and applicable to benefit plan year 2026 are an excellent window into our notable advancement. Within these results, 55% of our members are associated with 3.5 star plans or better, up from 23% last year.\nWe continue to operate and execute with increased precision throughout 2024, driving year-over-year improvement in many of our core administrative measures. We also continue to make progress closing care gaps for our members with year-over-year performance improvement in our HEDIS rates as well as medication adherence.\nAnd in a credit to our team's leadership and effort around continuous improvement, 1125 go-live for Medicare was the smoothest I've ever seen at Centene. We expect these and other advancements in our processes and key metrics to support STARs results as we take on 2025.\nAs you've heard from us before, we pruned our Medicare Advantage footprint coming into 2025 to better align with our Medicaid presence and capabilities, enhancing our ability to leverage Centene, size, scale and expertise. With this refined [indiscernible] for fresh products, we produced very good results relative to our expectations during the 2025 annual enrollment period.\nWe now expect Medicare enrollment in the low to mid 900,000. Product design, successful management of our distribution channels and local market knowledge contributed to the better-than-expected results. It is still early, but based on things we can know today, such as demographics and retention levels, we are pleased with the membership mix we are carrying into 2025, including a [indiscernible] around 40%.\nAmid program changes related to the inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D presented Centene with a nice growth opportunity in 2024 and the team executed well against that strategic plan. Part D or PDP is positioned to be a larger business for us once again in 2025, both by revenue and membership. During open enrollment, we went to market with a deliberate focus on value for our members, including premium affordability.\nThis plan complemented by the CMS demonstration program yielded strong AEP results that are expected to generate 2025 revenue of approximately $16 billion better than our previous expectations. Here, too, we are early relative to observed experience. But as we look at factors such as member demographics and product selection, we remain confident in the financial objectives we set forth at December's Investor Day, including a 1% target margin for the PDP business in 2025.\nFinally, a brief comment on the Medicare Advantage Advance rate notice released last month for the 2026 revenue year. While the information is not final, we are pleased to see the potential for a positive directional shift in funding for this important program, including the incorporation of a higher level of base rate medical cost trend.\nFinal rates are expected in April, and we will continue to assess this program changes anticipated for 2026 and the funding necessary to maintain compelling plans and create value for seniors as we build out our preliminary 2026 strategy. Within our Medicare segment's 2024 performance as a strong jump-off point we are excited to build upon the operational progress we made last year while taking important steps on our path towards breakeven in Medicare Advantage in 2027.\nFinally, marketplace. Across our footprint, our marketplace team has demonstrated consistently strong results through disciplined pricing, strong distribution relationships as well as unmatched local knowledge of the marketplace population and better delivered an outstanding performance in 2024 and carried that momentum into their 12th open enrollment period, once again executing well on fundamentals and positioning our portfolio of products for another year of strength in 2025.\nAccording to CMS, enrollment across the ACA market grew roughly 13%. But given the program integrity changes such as FTR or failure to report and the agent of record lock, our focus has been on effectuated membership. For Ambetter, January effectuated enrollment turned out to be a little stronger than what we had incorporated into our outlook for the business at our Investor Day in December, driven by strong member retention.\nOverall [ effection ] rates to date are directly in line with historical norms for Ambetter, which positions us for a peak marketplace membership during the first quarter, slightly above 5 million members.\nLooking down one level deeper. The demographic of our effectuated membership is similar to the member mix in 2024. Our book is expected to be roughly 51% female with an average age of 39.4, continuing a year-over-year trend of slightly younger membership.\nAt the same time, our metal tiers shifted slightly towards Silver. While we have been near 70% Silver over the last few years, in 2025, we expect to have nearly 75% of our membership in Silver plans, consistent with earlier years of the program.\nAs a reminder, our outlook continues to provide for an anticipated return to the pre-COVID era membership seasonality with net attrition down to the mid $4 million year-end. Overall, we are pleased with the early indicators around our marketplace business and believe that we positioned ourselves well in 2024 by being the first carrier to introduce an agent of record lock.\nOur views through January suggests a more muted impact to membership from the program integrity changes than originally anticipated, but we believe some may require a longer tail to play out and that it will be a few months until effectuated enrollment results are fully understood. As you would expect, we will continue to closely monitor effectuation rates, voluntary member terminations and other trends within our book as we move through the first quarter.\nAs we think about future trends in the individual market, I did want to call out the strong results we saw during open enrollment in our Georgia markets. We were pleased to be able to support Commissioner King in the state of Georgia as they made their transition to being a state-based exchange and we are excited to see how Georgia Access provides a model for advancing the growth of the individual market, both on and off exchange, which includes access to ICRA. As we shared in December, we continue to view ICRA as the future of health insurance for working Americans and is an important part of Centene's future earnings power.\nIn January, we announced the addition of [ Alan Silver ] to our leadership team. Alan is now President of Ambetter Health Solutions, which focuses on ICRA or individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements. Alan previously led retiree medical and ICRA initiatives at [ Willis Towers Watson], and we are thrilled that he has joined our team.\nAs we turn the page to a new year, it is important to acknowledge the incredible amount of hard work and tenacity from the Centene team that enabled Centene to deliver on our financial commitments in 2024. Countless obstacles and macro-level challenges faced by our team and our industry at large require focus and execution by colleagues from across our organization. As a result of staying tightly aligned to our strategic goals and our mission, we are now well positioned to capitalize on the important opportunities that we see ahead of us in 2025 and beyond.\nIn 2025, we expect to collaborate with our state partners to achieve better alignment for Medicaid rates and member acuity, our Medicare Advantage business following successful execution during AEP will focus on key operational initiatives to drive us forward on our journey to breakeven in 2027 and as the category leader, our marketplace team will once again offer access to high-quality and affordable health care this year to approximately 5 million Americans.\nThere is significant earnings power embedded in this business. with between $3 and $4 of adjusted EPS opportunity to unlock over time, we are eager to achieve our next set of enterprise milestones, deliver on our commitments to our members and generate shareholder value in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2024 results, including $36.3 billion in premium and service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 in the quarter.\nFor the full year, we reported $7.17 of adjusted EPS, well ahead of our previous guidance. In addition to ending the year strong, our results include a $0.29 net benefit for a marketplace cost sharing reduction or CSR, settlement related to prior years.\nOur Q4 consolidated HBR was 89.6%, while our full year consolidated HBR was 88.3%, consistent with our previous guidance range. Our Q4 Medicaid HBR was 93.4%, up 30 basis points from Q3. We were expecting a couple of later 2024 retro adjustments that did not come in by year-end.\nMedicaid trend story is similar to our last discussion, stable trends overall, now that we are essentially through redeterminations other than behavioral health and some pockets of home health costs consistent with past commentary.\nOur full year 2024 Medicaid HBR at 92.5%, temporarily high, driven by redeterminations presents us meaningful earnings power over the next couple of years as we turn the page on 2024 and better match rates and acuity going forward. Case in point, we are yielding around the mid-4s in net rate increases for the 1125 cohort, which now represents about 40% of our annual Medicaid premium.\nThe Medicaid membership settled out right in that $12.9 million to 13 million zone we had targeted, and our 2025 guidance is predicated on staying in this membership zone throughout 2025.\nMedicare segment performance was strong in Q4, including a very good overall 2024 performance in PDP as a few of you were concerned with the inflation Reduction Act at the beginning of 2024. Q4 PDR-related cost in Medicare Advantage were consistent with what we last told you. Commercial segment results were strong in Q4 due to the CSR settlement. Otherwise, they were right on track.\nOverall, exiting 2024 and a position of strength should bode well as we enter 2025 and continued Medicaid rate action as well as execution on initiatives designed to improve quality and the affordability of health care should enable us to achieve our 2025 Medicaid goals.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 9.7% last year, a continued blend of business mix and discipline. Cash flow provided by operations was only $154 million for the full year, driven by the timing of pharmacy rebate collections, the reduction in risk adjustment payables and the buildup of state premium payments receivable.\nAs these items normalize in future periods, it sets us up for stronger operating cash flow in 2025. Our unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at quarter end was $248 million. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 14.4 million shares of our common stock for $930 million. For the full year 2024, we repurchased 42 million shares for [ $3 million]. We have taken out over 100 million shares in the past few years. At the same time, our debt to adjusted EBITDA was only 2.9x at year-end.\nOur medical claims liability totaled $18.3 billion at year-end and represents 53 days in claims payable compared to 51 in Q3 of 2024 and 54 in Q4 of 2023. One DCP note looking ahead, given the meaningful growth in PDP in 2025, largely driven by the inflation Reduction Act and the fact that pharmacy claims complete very quickly compared to medical claims, this should lower our consolidated DCP by a few days in 2025.\nWell, 2024 was certainly a challenging year, we still grew adjusted EPS over 7%, powered through redeterminations, made some great progress in Medicare Stars and seized new growth opportunities in marketplace and PDP.\nLet's turn the page and look ahead. As you heard from Sarah, our marketplace open enrollment period reflects very good execution by our team and keeps us on track for our 2025 forecast elements covered at Investor Day.\nWe expect to peak right above 5 million marketplace members during Q1 and then a trip, the remainder of the year back to the mid-4s, consistent with pre-COVID enrollment patterns where Q1 was typically the annual peak of membership. And we need to see the pattern of membership throughout Q1 2025 before we touch commercial revenue guidance of $34 billion.\nIn our Medicare business, 2025 volume has started out stronger than expected, driven by the annual enrollment period results, notably driven by stronger retention. And our PDP business was over 7.5 million members as we entered 2025. Accordingly, we expect the Medicare segment to be about $2.5 billion higher in premium revenue in 2025 than what we discussed at Investor Day in December.\nIn addition to that $2.5 billion, there's another expected $1.5 billion in Medicaid revenue from program change, adding behavioral health coverage in one of our state contracts. So we are increasing our consolidated 2025 premium and service revenue guidance range by $4 billion to a range of $158 million to $160 billion of premium and service revenue. This is good news as you think about the long-term earnings power of Centene.\nAt this very early point in the year, we are reiterating our 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance floor of greater than $7 on $7.25.\nA quick comment on 2026 Medicare rates. The preliminary percentage rate change for us is in the low to mid-3s, including the positive impact of Stars from the work we did in 2023 and 2024. It's great to have 2024 behind us and have earnings power consistent with our Investor Day discussion in front of us.\nAs importantly, we are really excited about the number of initiatives [ like ] and in our sites designed to make health care simpler, more accessible and more affordable, just like we've been able to help shape and marketplace which has been a great solution for over 23 million Americans.\nWe are proud and honored to serve members, states and the federal government in Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace programs into 2025 and beyond. Thank you for your interest in Centene. Rocco, let's open up the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Jen Gilligan, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings results conference Call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. Ken Fasola, Centene's President; and Jon Dinesman, our Head of External Affairs, will also be available as participants during Q&A.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our second quarter 2024 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section.\nCentene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change.

A reconciliation of these measures, with the most directly comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our second quarter 2024 press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us as we review our second quarter 2024 financial results.\nThis morning, we reported second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.42, a stronger than previously anticipated result. Our earnings power in the period was supported by mixed results in our core business line, with strong execution in marketplace, partially offset by pressure in Medicaid resulting from redeterminations. Medicare continues to perform in line with our expectations.\nTaking a step back from the moving pieces of the quarter, our diversified platform continues to enable us to deliver earnings power consistent with our previous expectations as we navigate a dynamic health care landscape.\nGiven the importance of redeterminations to the Q2 results, let's start there. As many of you know and as we have been reporting on for well over a year now, this process has played out at an unprecedented scale and has driven a similarly unprecedented membership shift that we knew would require the rebalancing of rates to account for the acuity of the members we continue to serve on behalf of our state partners. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the disconnect between Medicaid rate and acuity that we saw materialized in the quarter, our underlying analysis continues to suggest this is largely due to the mix shift of the population and is therefore a temporary and addressable dynamic and one that we are already actively addressing.\nThe dialogue we established with each state's regulatory and actuarial counterparts early on in the lead-up to redeterminations have in this phase, allowed us to profile the shifts we are seeing as they emerge and resulted in rates for the second half of the year that are very much a step in the right direction. As you'll hear from Drew, this momentum is evidenced by an uptick in our expectation for the annualized composite rate adjustment.\nUltimately, we still anticipate the Medicaid business will return to a steady state pre-pandemic HBR range once we are fully beyond the redeterminations impact. And each month and each rate cycle gets us closer to a more normalized operating dynamic.\nIn addition to rightsizing rates, we continue to improve on the underlying Medicaid operations and to innovate as we look to drive health outcomes. One example of this is our new HALO program, which leverages peer-to-peer counseling to support recovery for members diagnosed with a substance use disorder. Innovations like this are well within our span of control and can help reduce medical costs for our state partners, while driving improved outcomes for our members.\nAs we work through an historic redetermination process, we have not lost sight of the opportunities for long-term growth in Medicaid, which is dependent on our ability to successfully procure and reprocure contracts at a state level. On this front, our business development team and local state teams continue to deliver, with previously discussed wins in critical geographies like Florida, Kansas and Michigan.\nWe have reviewed the recently announced actions taken by the state to finalize our new Florida contract and feel good about the outcome. We look forward to implementing that contract and to launching our new Arizona LTSS business, with a targeted start date in Q4 this year.\nThe strength of our local markets has been a key priority under the leadership of Dave Thomas, our CEO of Markets and Medicaid, who will be leaving Centene later this year after 25 years with the organization. Throughout that time, Dave has been influential in the company's success and has helped to build and support a team of exceptional, mission-driven market leaders.\nAs we position the organization for our next chapter of growth and innovation in Medicaid, we will leverage one of those leaders, as Nathan Landsbaum, who many of you now know from his role in Florida, prepare us to take a leadership role across the markets later this year. Nate has been with the organization for more than 18 years, and brings extensive experience ranging from corporate positions to health plan leadership roles in multiple markets.\nI want to thank Dave for the significant contribution he has made to our organization, and we look forward to working with Nate and our market CEOs to harness the power of incumbency and serve more members in more programs.\nTurning to marketplace. Centene's Ambetter Health demonstrated once again it is not only the undisputed leader in the individual market, but also serves as a strategic complement to our Medicaid business, providing coverage continuity for members and a natural hedge as we navigate mix and acuity shifts from redeterminations. Ambetter is delivering strong performance in the core business and delivering on margin expansion in 2024.\nAt the same time, the business has been able to capture in-year membership growth, contributing to this morning's increase in our full year premium and service revenue expectations. And to date, through the redetermination process, has exceeded expectations for serving members transitioning for Medicaid.\nFrom a macro perspective, the marketplace landscape continues to shift positively in our direction. With heightened awareness among consumers and the migration of micro and small commercial groups to the individual market, we see an increasingly accessible addressable market, giving us exciting room to run in this business. By executing well in the first half of 2024, we are harnessing the positive momentum we continue to gain with our members, providers and distribution partners.\nAs we look to 2025 and scenarios around the enhanced advanced premium tax credits, we believe the benefits of enabling access to affordable health care for more than 20 million Americans are clear. Coverage has been a critical driver of economic stability for rural communities across the country, particularly in states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, and mass adoption has finally made a long envisioned robust individual marketplace a reality. Rhetoric aside, we believe there is bipartisan alignment around the promise of this chassis, and that Centene is well positioned to build on this foundation to drive growth in 2025 and beyond.\nTo this end, we continue to track momentum around affordable, customized and portable coverage for individuals in the form of [indiscernible]. While this market is still very early, we believe it represents a compelling alternative to employer-sponsored coverage. And as the thought leader in this space, with the #1 brand in the individual market and without a commercial group business to protect, we see this as fertile organic hunting ground that can create upside to our story.\nMeanwhile, Centene's Medicare platform delivered an on-plan financial performance in the quarter and continues to make significant operational progress. We are, as many of you know, approaching an important milestone for this business, as we prepare for new Medicare Advantage star ratings to be unveiled in October. The pending stars announcement represents a critical step towards our previously established 3-year goal of achieving 85% of our Medicare Advantage membership enrolled in plans rated 3.5 stars or better as published in the fall of 2025. We are pleased with the operational progress that we have made year-to-date and remain on track to deliver steady progress compared to the 19% achieved by last year's efforts, recently updated to 23% by CMS.\nLet me give you a sense for what has tangibly improved. At this time, we have good visibility into results related to admin and ops. Consistent with prior updates, in this cycle, we were able to hold on to the gains we achieved last year and build upon them. Our performance continues to improve with the processing of appeals, CTMs and health risk assessments, and focused work by our call center and claims teams has driven improvements we would expect to see as part of scoring in October.\nOn the HEDIS front, the significant increase in member outreach that you heard about in Q3 and Q4 drove improved physician access and successfully closed gaps in care for many of our members. These are important lead indicators for improvement in our HEDIS scores.\nWe continue to invest in and strengthen these programs as we move through 2024, consistent with our commitment to and focus on quality enterprise-wide. We do not yet have final caps results or cut points, but as we sit here today, we are pleased with the progress against our internal expectations and expect this October 2024 milestone to be a meaningful step to our ultimate goal.\nRelative to 2025 Medicare bids, we remain focused on our product strategy of serving lower-income complex seniors. and despite a challenging rate environment, I'm proud of the work our team did to integrate a data-driven health equity lens into our supplemental benefits design. We also took the opportunity in this bid cycle to simplify our contractual footprint, all part of a multiyear strategy to build back to a high-quality, high-performing and profitable Medicare business aligned for growth.\nAs we approach November, we are certainly keeping a close eye on election dynamics at every level and scenario planning for key policy themes across our states and lines of business. As we have said before, at Centene, we focus on policy, not politics, and we operate day in and day out in a politically diverse ecosystem. We have demonstrated success over the past 25 years across multiple Republican and Democratic administrations. This is because we focus on our mission first and thoughtfully partner at both the state and federal level on solutions that work best for each community we serve.\nIn this role, I've had the honor of meeting with lawmakers across the country, including governors, senators, congressmen and women, state legislators and regulators and leaders of major federal policy committees. And while they have different views on many topics, there is one thing they all want, to improve the health of the communities they serve. This is Centene's mission, and it is a vision we firmly believe has bipartisan support regardless of the electoral outcome in November.\nWe are now more than halfway through 2024, and we are making good progress moving the organization beyond real but temporary headwinds, including Medicaid redeterminations and a well-documented Medicare Advantage ARS revenue challenge. At the same time, we are still hard at work strengthening the underlying business, modernizing our processes and infrastructure, adding exceptional talent and investing in innovation. We believe Centene's focus on government-sponsored health care positions us very well for profitable growth as we go forward, and we remain confident that we can deliver value to our shareholders by delivering value to our members and keeping them at the center of all that we do. We are pleased to reiterate our outlook for adjusted diluted EPS of greater than $6.80 during a dynamic year and look forward to furthering our progress in 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported second quarter 2024 results, including $36 billion in premium and service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.42, up 15% from Q2 of 2023. Results in the quarter, as previewed earlier in the week, were consistent with the dynamics we described intra-quarter in the May 29 8-K. The quarter serves as yet another example of the benefits of a diversified enterprise, allowing for varying degrees of performance among the many parts of our business. This Q2 result keeps us on track to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share in excess of $6.80 in 2024.\nOur consolidated HBR was 87.6% for Q2 and 87.3% year-to-date. This positions us to achieve the high end of our previous full year guidance range of around 87.9%. As previewed in the May 8-K, Medicaid medical expense was higher in Q2, largely due to the acuity of membership that remains as redeterminations wrap up.\nYou may recall about a year ago, we talked about needing from our state partners: one, acknowledgment; two, action; and three; sufficiency regarding matching rates with acuity. All states have acknowledged the need and intent to match rates and acuity, all but one have taken action. We are still working on the sufficiency with more visibility now that we're largely through redeterminations.\nThe acuity of the population that remains, the stayers plus the rejoiners, is now more clear to us and our state partners than when we were working through large membership shifts of Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. We continue to have constructive conversations with our state partners on the sufficiency and the timing of rates as we present them with updated data from the latter part of the redetermination process.\nPursuant to these efforts, we now expect the back half of 2024 Medicaid composite rates to be 4% plus, relative to our original forecast of 2% to 2.5%. This 7 1 to 10 1 rate cycle will impact about half of our Medicaid premium. So this will help the trajectory of the HBR in the back half of the year compared to Q2's 92.8%. While we certainly have more work to do on rates in 2024 and 2025, we have no change in our long-term view of the ultimate proper matching of rates and acuity in our Medicaid business.\nMeanwhile, our Marketplace business continues to perform well, not just as we wrapped up 2023 risk adjustment with great execution, but also in our 2024 positioning and performance, including a little more growth in 2024 with 4.4 million members at quarter end.\nLet me hit the highlights of Tuesday's 8-K. In the past decade, we've gotten pretty good at operating the marketplace business, including accumulation and submission of data to get paid the right revenue to match the acuity of our marketplace population. Result of that execution, which improved year-over-year, was a better-than-expected result as we wrapped up the edge server process in May and estimated the value of our submissions as we referenced in the May 8-K. This was subsequently corroborated by Wakely data, then ultimately, CMS' final notice published this past Monday. The result was a net favorable pickup expected in our 2024 P&L of approximately $600 million, as outlined in Tuesday's filing, again, great execution in marketplace.\nOur Medicare segment continues to be on track with our expectations for 2024, and we look forward to continue to improve that business over the next few years as STAR scores improve and we get the requisite revenue to drive better performance.\nAnd despite redeterminations and divestitures, this company continues to outperform in premium revenue. You can see that in the year-to-date reported revenue. Accordingly, we increased the 2024 full year premium and service revenue guidance by $5 billion compared to our April 2024 earnings release, approximately $1 billion in Medicaid, $2 billion in commercial and $2 billion in Medicare segment revenue, to a range of $141 million to $143 billion. That bodes well for the future, exiting 2024 with a higher revenue base upon which to drive EPS growth in 2025 and beyond.\nOne other guidance update, we now expect over $1.55 billion of investment income in 2024, excluding gains on divestitures. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.0% in the second quarter, on track with our full year guidance. Cash flow provided by operations was $2.2 billion in Q2. Unregulated cash on hand at quarter end was $217 million. Consistent with previous comments, we expect the majority of deployable cash to be available during the second half of the year.\nIn the first half of the year, we deployed $851 million on Centene shares. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.8x at quarter end. Our medical claims liability at quarter end represented 54 days in claims payable, up 1 day sequentially and up 2 days compared to Q2 of 2023.\nThe diversified portfolio of Centene performed well as a whole in the first half of 2024. And while we expect some continued pressure on our Medicaid HBR in the second half of the year compared to our original goal, we expect Medicaid HBR improvement relative to Q2, given the second half rate action. Further rate action into 2025 would continue the improvement.\nOn the topic of 2025, it's much too early to give 2025 guidance, but we can walk you through the tailwinds and headwinds that we believe today relative to 2024. In the category of 2025 tailwinds, we currently forecast: one, HBR improvement in Medicaid as we expect to make continued progress on rates throughout 2025; two, a return to Medicaid growth post redeterminations; three, growth in the overall marketplace market and in our membership; four, the absence of a Medicare PDR in 2025. Recall, we have a $125 million PDR P&L hit embedded in our current 2024 guidance. Five, revenue growth in PDP; six, capital deployment in 2024 annualizing into 2025 and capital deployment in 2025; seven, continued progress on improving operational efficiency and SG&A execution.\n2025 headwinds would include: one, the annualization of the first half of 2024 final redetermination impact on 2025 premium revenue; two, we wouldn't expect to repeat the $600 million prior year marketplace risk adjustment benefit; and three, federal reserve rate actions gradually impacting investment income. We will provide more insight as we get through 2024, and we expect to provide formal 2025 guidance at our Investor Day in December.\nLooking ahead, we are clearly focused on influencing our state partners to match rates with acuity, improving stars, continuing to position our marketplace products to produce strong margins and we are planning to deliver on our 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of greater than $6.80 and grow adjusted EPS thereafter.\nThank you for your interest in Centene, and we can open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2024 earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. Ken Fasola, Centene's President, will also be available as a participant during Q&A.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed on February 20, 2024 and other public SEC filings. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.\nThe call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2024 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us as we discuss our first quarter 2024 results. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.26, ahead of our previous expectations for the period. As a result of this strong start to the year, we are increasing our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to greater than $6.80. Drew will cover the quarter and our updated financial outlook in further detail in a few moments. While there is still more work to do, we are pleased with the first quarter results and we'll look to harness the positive momentum we are generating in our core businesses as we move through the balance of the year.\nIn 2024, Centene's focus remains on our work to streamline and modernize the underlying infrastructure of our company and to assemble the people, processes and tools necessary to deliver best-in-class experiences to our members, providers, regulators and state partners. Let me share a couple of examples of progress here. During the first quarter, we completed an important initiative to simplify our prior authorization process by automating our real-time source data. This simplification improves the timeliness of authorization decisions, ensuring our members get the care they need quickly and removing friction from the process overall for both members and providers.\nQ1 also saw the accumulation of months of thoughtful and thorough go-live preparation in Oklahoma. Our team obtained perfect scores in our readiness review from the state, and we are thrilled to be serving Oklahomans statewide as of April 1.\nFinally, our improved operational agility also allowed Centene to mobilize quickly in support of our members and provider partners in the wake of the Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident. This included launching a national provider outreach campaign that spans Centene's provider network across all products, Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace, and has included targeted efforts to support those disproportionately impacted by the outage, including FQHCs, safety net hospitals, rural health clinics and behavioral health providers. We appreciate the focus on and support for last mile providers from HHS and CMS throughout this process as these clinicians represent a critical component of the infrastructure through which our members access high-quality health care.\nNow on to our business lines. We are roughly 90% of the way through redeterminations, and our Medicaid franchise continues to demonstrate resilience as we navigate the complexities of this unprecedented process. As you can see from today's release, our first quarter membership tracked slightly higher than our expectation at Investor Day in December. Overall, we continue to be well guided with respect to membership and rate by the projection model we built state by state more than a year ago and that we continue to refine as we move through the redetermination process.\nAs we've noted before, 2024 represents an important year for blocking and tackling through acuity shifts and corresponding rate discussions with our state partners to ensure we are positioned to provide high-quality services for our members. We are actively engaged in that process and are seeing solid results thus far with opportunities still ahead. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect these discussions to increasingly represent the regular back-and-forth dialogue we maintain with our state partners in the normal course of managing the dynamics around each individual Medicaid program we serve.\nAt the same time, we have been executing on important reprocurements and the early months of 2024 delivered notable data points. Most of the key RFP results are now public, positioning us well to generate continued Medicaid growth in a post redeterminations world. Centene reprocured one of our largest contracts with the recent announcement of intended awards by the state of Florida. Although the protest period is ongoing, Centene is well positioned based on Florida's determination that Sunshine Health is among those that will provide best value to the state.\nIn Michigan, we were thrilled to be selected to continue serving the vast majority of our existing membership with some opportunity to grow, and we look forward to our continued collaboration with the state. In Texas, our protest remains ongoing. We are honored to have served Texans for 25 years and intend to defend Superior Health's ability to provide access to affordable and high-quality health care for our members in the Lone Star state. We are proud of the way our health plans and business development team have delivered so far during this critical cycle of reprocurements.\nThe Centene value proposition remains a powerful one, built on more than 4 decades of experience serving Medicaid communities, an unwavering local approach and a commitment to innovation in the services and support we bring to our members. We are honored to provide access to care as well as community-based support to improve the lives of those we serve in 31 states across the country.\nMoving to Medicare. The Medicare Advantage macro landscape remains challenging. Consistent with our prior view, we see final 2025 funding levels as insufficient with respect to general medical cost trend expectations. Drew will provide some early commentary around our strategy to navigate Medicare in 2025 as a result. Medicare Advantage STAR ratings remain the single most powerful lever to drive performance in this vital business and continue to represent a top priority across the organization.\nAs we drive to our goal of 85% of members in 3.5 STAR contracts by October of 2025, we continue to see improved progress and stability in our performance and expect those to be reflected in our results come October. We are tracking year-over-year improvements in our core operations as well as in the ways we support our members as they receive care. And we are carrying forward this positive momentum into 2024 as our teams are clearly focused and aligned on quality.\nLonger term, Medicare Advantage remains an important business for Centene. The strategic link between Medicare and Medicaid has only become more explicit since our last earnings call. Recent CMS rule-making included final requirements to better coordinate dual special needs plans or D-SNP participation with important milestones beginning in 2027. By the end of the decade, a Medicaid footprint will be a prerequisite to D-SNP growth. Centene is perfectly positioned to gain positive momentum from this growing bond between Medicare and Medicaid.\nFinally, Marketplace. This business continues to represent a unique and powerful segment for Centene, and our teams are executing well against the opportunity. With approximately 4.3 million Marketplace lives at the end of the first quarter, Centene's Marketplace membership has more than doubled in size compared to just 2 short years ago. This exceptional growth has been accompanied by consistent margin expansion as our deep product knowledge and staying power in the market enable us to forecast pretax margins well within our targeted range of 5% to 7.5% for 2024. We are pleased with the traction our Ambetter health products are generating and see additional room to expand the reach of health insurance marketplace offerings overall.\nIn 2024, the source of our membership growth is widely diversified. Based on a survey we conducted following open enrollment, nearly 40% of new members identify as previously uninsured. Approximately 25% joined us from another marketplace carrier, and approximately 10% chose Ambetter after losing access to an employer-sponsored plan. This is in addition to those members who selected Ambetter after losing Medicaid coverage. As we look to the future of marketplace, we expect new member growth to be driven by an increasingly addressable and accessible uninsured population and the evolution occurring as employers consider alternative options for providing employer-sponsored insurance.\nCentene has been rapidly evolving as an organization over the last 2 years. We have been resolute in creating focus, trimming the organization down to the core strategic assets that give us the strongest platform for future growth. We are executing against our strategic plans, fortifying and modernizing our infrastructure and successfully delivering access to affordable, high-quality health care for millions of Americans. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate the power of our diversified earnings drivers as we deliver on our financial commitments, maintain our posture of disciplined capital deployment and continue to invest to support long-term growth.\nAs always, we want to thank our nationwide workforce of nearly 60,000 for showing up every day committed to improving the lives of our members and transforming the health of the communities we serve. This Centeam is the engine that ultimately powers our results and amplifies our impact.\nWith that, let's turn the call over to Drew for more details around our performance in the first quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2024. Drew?\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported first quarter 2024 results, including $36.3 billion in premium and service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.26 in the quarter, 7% higher than Q1 of 2023. This result was better than our expectations and we are increasing full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to greater than $6.80. This quarter is a good example of the benefit of a diversified business with multiple levers to drive results.\nOur Q1 consolidated HBR was 87.1%, which is right on track for our full year guidance. Here's an example of the benefit of that diversification since we provide you with transparency into the line of business components. Medicaid at 90.9% was a little higher in the quarter than we expected as we continue to work through the appropriate matching of rates and acuity in the short term. Redeterminations are certainly front and center in the acuity rate match process, but getting the right match for other circumstances such as states changing pharmacy programs or behavioral health practices are also important initiatives in a handful of states. On the other hand, our commercial HBR at 73.3% was a little better than we had planned in the quarter driven by the continued strength of our Marketplace business. And our Medicare segment at 90.8% was right on track in the quarter. All of this netting out to 87.1%, a good result.\nGoing a little bit deeper into each of our business lines, Medicaid membership at 13.3 million members was slightly better than the 13.2 million members we forecasted as of Q1 -- for Q1 as of our Investor Day. Drivers of membership for the remainder of the year include, one, new wins such as Oklahoma and Arizona LTSS; two, the return of slight growth in markets once redeterminations are [ complete ], plus the rejoiners dynamic; net of three, the substantial wind-down of redeterminations over the next 3 to 4 months. Upon reforecasting the sloping of membership and revenue for 2024, including Q1 membership being a little bit higher than planned, we added $1 billion of Medicaid premium revenue to our 2024 guidance. The overall composite rate is running a little above the 2.5% we last referenced, and we have over 75% member month rate visibility into the 2024 calendar year.\nRegardless of the temporary work to match rates and acuity, our long-term goal remains to return to the high 89s HBR as we look out over the 2025, 2026 time frame. All things considered, we are pretty pleased with the performance of our Medicaid business 1 year into a very complex redetermination process. And as Sarah covered, we cannot be more pleased with our performance in recent Florida and Michigan Medicaid RFPs. The Texas protest process still needs to play out.\nOur commercial business performed very well in the quarter in terms of both growth and HBR. Consistent with previous comments, we grew from 3.9 million marketplace members at year-end to 4.3 million at the end of Q1. For the past 2 years, we have consistently delivered a combination of growth, coupled with improving margin. Our guidance assumes that we stay at 4.3 million marketplace members for the rest of 2024. If we can grow during the special enrollment period, which we've been able to do in the past 2 years, there would be upside to our premium and service revenue guidance. So stay tuned.\nOur current 2024 guidance assumes about $16 billion of Medicare Advantage revenue, representing 12% of total premium and service revenue guidance and approximately $4 billion of PDP revenue. I previously mentioned at a conference that Medicare inpatient authorizations were higher than expected in January and February. March authorizations ended up being lower than February, though still elevated from Q4. And Medicare outpatient trend continues at the elevated level we first saw in Q2 of 2023, though reasonably steady. Nonetheless, the performance in the quarter for the Medicare segment was in line with our expectations and our full year view has not changed. We had good performance with our new pharmacy cost structure and executed well on other operating levers.\nAs we look ahead, I feel like we are making 2025 decisions with our eyes wide open: inpatient and outpatient trends, complex pharmacy changes from the Inflation Reduction Act, an insufficient 2025 rate environment based upon the final rate notice and a risk model being phased in beginning in 2024, that is punitive to partial and full duals. It also seems like many of our peers should have more religion in setting benefits at sustainable levels given these headwinds.\nI'll repeat what I said on the mic at the conference in March. To accomplish our strategic goals with our Medicare Advantage business, it doesn't matter if we ultimately level off at $14 billion, $15 billion or $16 billion of Medicare Advantage revenue. What is strategically important is the alignment with Medicaid and those complex populations we want to serve, especially given where the puck is heading with regulations pulling duals and Medicaid closer together. We're still in the process of making 2025 county-by-county decisions, and we'll finalize and submit Medicare bids in early June. So we'll provide you with more 2025 Medicare commentary on our Q2 call.\nWe expect Medicare to be a good business for us in the long run, and it's an important part of our overall portfolio. We need to deliver on STARS improvements, clinical levers and SG&A actions over the next few years, and those efforts remain on track.\nGoing to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.7% in the first quarter, consistent with our updated mix of business, including growth in Marketplace. Cash flow used in operations was $456 million for Q1, primarily driven by net earnings, more than offset by the timing of risk corridor payments, a delay in March's premium payment from one of our large state partners subsequently received in early April and slower receipt of pharmacy rebates as we transition to a new third-party PBM in [ January ] of 2024.\nFrom January 1 through mid-April, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $251 million. Our share repurchase goal for 2024 is unchanged at $3 billion to $3.5 billion. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9x at quarter end, consistent with year-end. And during Q1, we were pleased to maintain our S&P BBB- rating under the updated S&P rating model. Our medical claims liability at quarter end represented 53 days in claims payable, down 1 day from Q1 and Q4 of 2023. DCP was actually up due to Change Healthcare claims receipt delays, then back down due to an acceleration of state-directed payments to providers and lower pharmacy invoices outstanding at quarter end.\nYou'll see in the reserve table that our 2024 Medicare Advantage PDR is up $50 million in the quarter. This progression in the 2024 PDR was expected and planned for due to quarterly seasonality in Medicare Advantage. Though it's early in the year, we are comfortable adding $1 billion of premium and service revenue and $0.10 of adjusted EPS to our 2024 guidance. You'll also see some mechanical changes to total revenue driven by pass-through premium taxes and the GAAP effective tax rate due to the Circle divestiture. We also expect investment income to be a little bit above our previous forecast of $1.4 billion while still providing for a few rate cuts in 2024.\nQ1 was a quarter of momentum. We put another quarter of redeterminations behind us. We reprocured one of our largest contracts and are well positioned in Florida. We executed well in the Marketplace annual enrollment period and put up a strong quarter of both growth and margin. We delivered on the January 1 PBM conversion and our businesses and customers are benefiting from improved cost structure. We continue to advance our multiyear operational improvements, and Centene continues to attract talent. And all of this resulted in strong Q1 results and increased 2024 guidance. While there is plenty more to achieve, we are off to a good start in 2024.\nThank you for your interest in Centene. Rocco, please open the line up for questions."

The company is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain 2024 measures to the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported a strong finish to a very productive 2023. Fourth quarter results include adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, generating full year 2023 adjusted EPS of $6.68. The quarterly and full year EPS results were slightly ahead of internal expectations and provide the organization with positive momentum as we head into 2024.\nWe've been planning for and talking about 2024 for a while. And now that we're here, we're focused on positioning each of our lines of business for long-term growth, while continuing the important work to fortify our platform as we prepare for 2025 and beyond. Specifically, we are working through the tail of the redeterminations process, positioning Centene to resume organic enrollment growth in Medicaid and to pursue new program opportunities from a position of strength.\nWe are solidifying our Medicare Advantage footprint, thanks to an annual enrollment period that largely hit the mark with respect to our target membership, including sales, retention and disenrollment. And we are capturing a powerful growth opportunity in marketplace, demonstrated by the increased revenue guidance we issued this morning.\nWe recognize that amid these opportunities, we still have valuable bottom line work to do. And we are approaching that work with the same focus and disciplined execution that has defined the first 2 years of this management team's tenure. In fact, the CenTeam wasted no time setting the tone for 2024 by successfully delivering what we believe to be the largest ever PBM platform migration and improving our pharmacy cost structure on behalf of our customers and members. We have processed more than 40 million scripts so far through ESI and are pleased with the way this massive undertaking has rolled out.\nThere is always a period of issue management after a change of this magnitude and the teams have worked tirelessly and collaboratively to prioritize member access to care during this transition. We will continue to closely monitor end-to-end processing and customer service as we move through the year.\nAdditionally, in January, Centene closed the divestiture of Circle Health, the last of our international assets, and the company can now focus solely on our domestic core businesses. Circle marks the tenth divestiture since we began the portfolio review process in late 2021, and we are pleased to have purposefully streamlined our enterprise while keeping the portfolio of divestitures net accretive to earnings and generating cash for deployment.\nIn the broader context of value creation, our SG&A initiatives remain on track to exceed our original savings goals, and we continue to identify opportunities to drive operating efficiency through modernization and process improvement. Annual enrollment periods for both Marketplace and Medicare also contribute to our confidence in Centene's 2024 positioning. Continued pricing discipline in Marketplace and the deliberate actions we took to align our 2024 Medicare bids with our strategic focus on lower income and complex members yielded the intended results on both fronts.\nMarketplace growth was more robust than anticipated, fueled by better-than-anticipated overall market growth as individual commercial offerings continue to gain traction with an expanding consumer set. As such, we expect to deliver both growth and our planned margin expansion in marketplace in 2024. Together, these dynamics position us well to achieve our 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $6.70.\nWith that, let's click deeper into each of our core business lines. Within Medicaid, we have delivered important proof points around the power of incumbency while navigating the unprecedented dynamics of redeterminations. In December, we were awarded the Arizona LTSS contract that will expand our footprint in serving complex populations in that state. That same month, we added approximately 90,000 members to our care and coverage through the successful go-live of Medicaid expansion in North Carolina.\nAnd in early January, we successfully reprocured our New Hampshire contract, earning the top score in the Granite State among competitors. Our uniquely local footprint fosters important and trusted relationships with the communities and state partners we serve and continues to differentiate us as we retain and grow our largest business.\nTurning to redeterminations. The process continues to track largely in line with our expectations. As of year-end, we were approximately 80% of the way through the projected member transitions, and consistent with our modeling, we ended 2023 right around 14.4 million Medicaid members. Our health plan presidents, along with our Medicaid actuarial teams, continue to work in concert with our state partners to monitor the risk pool impact of membership changes and calibrate rates to match acuity in the near term. To that end, we received some, but not all, of the outstanding 2023 retrospective rate adjustments we mentioned during our December Investor Day before year-end, and we still feel good about our 2024 Medicaid guidance as we sit here in early February.\nWhile Medicare has been a hot topic for the industry of late, we are pleased that the annual enrollment period played out largely as expected for Centene. And our 2024 financial projections for Medicare remain unchanged from Investor Day.\nDuals or D-SNP members have grown as a percentage of our Medicare enrollment as thoughtful benefit design changes allowed us to invest in and effectively refocus our book on members to whom we have the strongest ability to provide long-term value. We expect D-SNP members to represent more than 35% of our Medicare Advantage membership by year-end, an important step relative to our strategic plan.\nAs an organization, we remain laser-focused on advancing our Medicare quality agenda. We made progress on a number of initiatives in 2023 that create positive momentum as we continue to execute in 2024. This includes expanding our member outreach capacity, which ultimately allows us to conduct over 1.1 million preventive service outreach calls, reach 80% more members and schedule 62 more appointments year-over-year. At the same time, we invested in digital data and provider connectivity, successfully deploying direct EMR connectivity to over 640,000 provider practices.\nAnd finally, we continue to drive core administrative and customer experience performance with service levels remaining in the high 90s through Q4. All of these efforts are important contributors to our long-term stars performance goals. In 2024, as planned, we will continue to invest in this space with an obvious focus on Medicare Advantage star ratings, but with an approach that will drive benefit across lines of business.\nWith respect to Medicare utilization, as you heard from us in December, our 2024 bids incorporate a level of elevated medical trend related to non-inpatient services. To date, based on our full year and fourth quarter claims experience, we continue to view our pricing posture is adequate to support our 2024 Medicare outlook.\nPreliminary Medicare Advantage rates for 2025 were released last week. Bearing in mind the continued expectation for the multiyear phase-in of the risk adjustment model change that was finalized in 2023, we view the preliminary rates as insufficient with respect to general medical cost trend expectations. Drew will provide some additional thoughts on the preliminary rate in a moment.\nAs this audience is well aware, we will receive final Medicare Advantage rates for 2025 in early April. And at the time of our first quarter call, we will have a better directional sense for bid strategy related to next year.\nFinally, Marketplace. As you've heard from us with increasing enthusiasm in recent months, Marketplace presents Centene with a unique opportunity for simultaneous revenue growth and margin expansion in 2024. Overall, market growth was stronger than expected during this open enrollment period, and we successfully captured our target market share of the expanded pie, netting to stronger-than-expected OEP results for the company.\nWithin our 4.3 million member footprint as of January, our market share increased to roughly 26%, up from 23% previously, serving as another proof point of our leadership in the space. This strong enrollment result is driving the $2.5 billion increase to our full year 2024 premium and service revenue guidance.\nMembership mix continues to skew slightly younger, consistent with the year-over-year trend we saw last year. And distribution across metal tiers is consistent with our expectation, with silver plans representing the majority of our enrollment.\nOne driver of overall Marketplace growth has been members impacted by Medicaid redeterminations. On that front, we continue to track towards the top half of our previously provided guidance range of 200,000 to 300,000 redetermined lives captured by Ambetter. Ultimately, the individual commercial market represents a strategic opportunity for Centene, and we are excited to enable the expanding reach of these offerings as the demands of the market evolves.\nWhile the dynamic businesses Centene operates in continue to ebb and flow, the strength and diversification of our government-sponsored health care platform creates resiliency. We see tremendous opportunity for our core products both near and long term. We will continue to execute against these opportunities to improve health outcomes for our members, generate profitable growth and drive shareholder return.\nBefore I turn it over to Drew, I want to take just a moment to thank the entire CenTeam for how you showed up in 2023 on behalf of our members and our partners. I am honored to work alongside you in 2024 as we make this company stronger every day and transform the health of the communities we serve one person at a time.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Drew for more details around our financial performance and 2024 outlook.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2023 results, including $35.3 billion in premium and service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.45 in the quarter. For the full year, we reported $6.68 of adjusted EPS, growth of over 15% compared to 2022, including a 5.5% beat to our original 2023 guidance. And that's on the heels of growing adjusted EPS 12% in 2022 compared to 2021.\nOur Q4 consolidated HBR was 89.5%, while our full year consolidated HBR was 87.7%, both in the range of our expectations. Medicaid at 90.0% for the full year was slightly higher than our expectations. As of Q3, we were 89.9% year-to-date and we posted 90.6% in the fourth quarter.\nAs we mentioned at our Investor Day in December, there were some open Medicaid retro rate adjustments. At year-end, had we received those adjustments, our full year 2023 Medicaid HBR would have been about 10 basis points better. All things considered over 9 months into redeterminations, our original forecast for membership, acuity and rates were very close. As you can see in the membership tables, we were at 14.47 million Medicaid members at year-end, consistent with the 14.4 million we were forecasting as shared in the Investor Day appendix. That reflects an approximate 1.9 million Medicaid member reduction since 3/31/23 due to redeterminations as expected.\nTo reiterate what we laid out at Investor Day, our 2024 guidance reflects a low point of 13.2 million Medicaid members at 3/31/24 and year-end 2024 membership of approximately 13.6 million. That all ties to our 2024 midpoint of $80.5 billion of Medicaid premium revenue. So no changes to our 2024 view of Medicaid revenue, membership or HBR. Medicare full year HBR was 87.1%, which includes the $250 million premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter that we first discussed with you back in April of 2023.\nOn Medicare trend, we continue to see steady but elevated levels of outpatient trend, consistent with what we began to see in Q2 and consistent with our forecast. We also saw a pickup of COVID costs in December, as we mentioned in early January, though not alarming compared to prior COVID cycles. We thought about the current level of trend when we booked the 2024 PDR and continue to believe our forecasts are consistent with delivering our 2024 Medicare segment guidance elements outlined at Investor Day.\nTo help you with some math, the $250 million premium deficiency reserve lifted the fourth quarter Medicare segment HBR by approximately 475 basis points, and the full year Medicare HBR by approximately 110 basis points.\nThe commercial HBR at 79.8% for the full year continues to be strong. Simultaneously in Q4, we were also capturing growth from both redeterminations and the special enrollment period, and we were up to 3.9 million marketplace members as of year-end. That is the source of the strong premium growth in the fourth quarter. And as you heard from Sarah, we couldn't be more pleased with the growth that continued into January 2024, up to approximately 4.3 million members. This continued growth in HBR performance in 2023 sets us up very well to achieve our 2024 Marketplace goals.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 9.3% last year. consistent with our updated mix of business along with Medicare distribution costs. Cash flow provided by operations was $8.1 billion for the full year, representing 2.2x adjusted net earnings. This was primarily driven by net earnings, an increase in risk adjustment payable for Marketplace, and the timing of pass-through payments.\nOur unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at year-end was approximately $200 million. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 397,000 shares of our common stock for $27 million. For the full year 2023, we repurchased 22.9 million shares for $1.58 billion, a little over our goal of $1.5 billion. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9x at year-end. Our medical claims liability totaled $18.0 billion at year-end and represents 54 days in claims payable, compared to 53 in Q3 of 2023 and 54 in Q4 of 2022.\nLooking back at 2023, it was a very good year of execution. We beat original adjusted EPS by 5.5%. We bought back 4% of the company's shares for a cumulative total of over 10% since Q1 of 2022.\nWe continue to execute on divestitures. We completed 5 divestitures in 2023, closed the divestiture of Circle in January of 2024, and received approximately $850 million in net proceeds in January. In total, we have completed 10 divestitures and are close to wrapping up that successful phase of value creation.\nOn January 1, 2024, as Sarah mentioned, we successfully executed on our PBM conversion. RFPing and moving PBMs has become one of our core competencies. And as a result of that, we have improved our pharmacy cost structure on behalf of our members and customers. And we doubled Marketplace membership since year-end 2022 and fortified Ambetter's #1 position. 2023, a pretty good year.\nWe have provided detailed 2024 financial guidance elements at our December Investor Day. Since then, we've gained some additional clarity around the AEP and OEP results in Medicare and Marketplace. Medicare enrollment is tracking right in line with our expectations relative to both volume and product mix. I give the Medicare team credit for precision in sales, disenrollment and membership product mix forecast, as well as execution in a challenging year.\nWhile Medicare Advantage is only a $16 billion revenue stream for us, it represents a meaningful margin expansion opportunity as we improve stars over the next few years and begin to have that reflected in revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nTo reinforce Sarah's comments on the 2025 advanced notice, we're in the process of preparing our feedback with questions so far around the adequacy of fee-for-service trend and a new method for normalization that further reduced the rate. For us, the rate change as it sits today is approximately minus 1.3% before risk coding trend. And the new risk model introduced last year, and that's being phased in, still has a disproportionate negative effect on partial and full duals, the most vulnerable populations in Medicare.\nOur Marketplace chassis continues to be well positioned for both growth and margin. Marketplace growth is running ahead of our previous expectations, allowing us to raise our full year 2024 consolidated premium and service revenue guidance by $2.5 billion, which takes our guidance to a midpoint of $136 billion. Appetite for Marketplace products continues to be strong as these offerings successfully provide both health care access and affordability for millions of beneficiaries. At this very early point in the year, we are reiterating our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $6.70.\nAs we turn the page from 2023, we can quickly reflect back on our second strong year of execution from this management team and positive progression of the company. I couldn't be more excited to drive success with this team and provide affordable access to health care for our members in 2024 and beyond.\nThank you for your interest in Centene. Rocco, you can open the line up, please."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. Ken Fasola, Centene's President, will also be available as a participant during Q&A.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2023, and other public SEC filings. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change.\nWhile the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2023 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section. The company is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain 2024 measures to the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range.\nFinally, we'd like to highlight our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for December 12 in New York City. This event will also be available via webcast. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jen. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported very strong third quarter 2023 results, including adjusted EPS of $2, outperforming our internal expectations by approximately $0.20. Strong fundamentals and excellent marketplace growth and performance contributed to the strength in the quarter as well as our improved outlook for 2023. We now expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of at least $6.60, representing over 14% year-over-year growth.\nWith my time this morning, I'll hit on key focus areas, including Medicaid redeterminations, upcoming RFPs, marketplace performance and recent Medicare Advantage Stars results and then provide a brief update on the operational progress we have made over the last few months. Then I'll turn it over to Drew to provide details on the quarter and additional commentary relative to our increased financial guidance for 2023. Let's start with Medicaid. We are now over 40% or approximately 1 million members through redeterminations, and we continue to track in line with our expectations for membership and acuity changes as well as our assumed sloping of overall timing.\nAs we closely monitor Medicaid membership transitions, rejoin our data remains instructive as we think about the net membership impact of redeterminations and coverage continuity. We are now seeing April through August cohorts consistently experiencing rejoining rates in the mid-20% range. Importantly, the 90-day grace period in most states means that the majority of these members have no break in coverage as they return to the Medicaid program. CMS has obviously been playing an important role with respect to the oversight of the Medicaid redeterminations process, including recent intervention to pause redeterminations in certain states as well as the effort to reinstate children and individuals who are incorrectly dropped from coverage due to system issues. We are seeing some of the impact of these reinstatements come through in our rejoiner data and continue to monitor the impact these changes will have on the timing of expected membership shifts over the coming months.\nThat said, we have not changed our view that the ultimate impact of redeterminations would be 2.3 million to 2.4 million members. And based on our view of recent CMS actions and our ongoing conversations with state partners, we still expect the overwhelming majority of redeterminations to be completed by May of 2024. We continue to track in line with our expected 200,000 to 300,000 members moving from Medicaid into marketplace as a result of the redetermination process. We have partnered with an increasing number of states to make auto enrollment a more seamless path for Medicaid members losing eligibility and are pleased to be able to leverage our market-leading and better platform to maximize coverage continuity for members of the communities we serve.\nOur rate discussions continue to be constructive as well. The consistent trend we saw in 7/1 and 10/1 rate cohorts has continued so far as the first wave of 1124 draft rates have been released. We are working through an incomplete 4:1 retro rate as Drew will discuss further, but continue to have constructive discussions there as well. We appreciate the thoughtful and database collaboration with our state partners as they acknowledge the importance of matching rates with acuity in order to maintain the strength and effectiveness of each Medicaid program.\nOverall, we are encouraged by the progress that states are making with respect to Medicaid redeterminations. I'm pleased to be moving through the process with operational stability and results that are consistent with our modeling. Turning to growth. In North Carolina, we are preparing for Medicaid expansion that will go live in December. North Carolina is the 41st state to expand Medicaid. And by passing this legislation with the joint leadership of a democratic governor and a Republican supermajority legislature, they demonstrate the increasing bipartisan support for this program.\nWe expect this trend to continue as states look to provide improved access to quality care for their citizens. In RFP news, our Sunshine Health team officially submits our response to the Florida ITM this week. I want to give a nod to the Sunshine Health team to our exceptional business development team and the many send teamers who contributed to this effort. I'm proud of the work they did to prepare this response and proud of the long-standing partnership we have established in serving the communities of Florida. In general, we are seeing an increase in RFP activity and momentum around states considering the addition of new populations into a managed care model.\nNotably, the recently released Georgia RFP includes, for the first time, the state's aged, blind and disabled population. As we look ahead to our procurement pipeline, we feel good about the opportunity to leverage our incumbent position and our differentiated depth of expertise in managing complex populations to defend and grow our Medicaid footprint. In support of this work, I'm happy to share that we have officially appointed Wade Rakes as Centene's Chief Growth Officer. Wade will take on this responsibility in addition to continuing to serve as the CEO of our Peach State Health Plan as he leads our incredibly strong Georgia team through their procurement remaining at the helm through the conclusion of that process.\nWade will bring valuable experience as both a local and enterprise leader for Centene as he helps to drive execution around our growth strategy. Turning to Marketplace. Our Ambetter franchise continues to outperform this year, outpacing our growth expectations in the quarter and reaching just under 3.7 million members as of September 30. This means added earnings power for the remainder of 2023 as well as a potential earnings tailwind for 2024 as our retained special enrollment period or SEP members become more profitable in their software year with Ambetter.\nAmbetter's unique individual market density, consistent performance and market-leading brand recognition have enabled us to build attractive and efficient networks and to foster productive relationships with a vast array of distribution partners. This has driven our impressive growth in 2023 and positions us well to continue to serve this large and expanding addressable market. We'll have an opportunity to dive more deeply into the future growth drivers of this business during our Investor Day in December and remain excited by the growth and earnings potential of the individual market in both the short term and the long term.\nFinally, Medicare. This is an important time of year for our Medicare Advantage business as 2024 enrollment begins to take shape through the annual enrollment period, which kicked off on October 15. As you'll recall, the 2024 bid cycle represents a pivot point for our Medicare Advantage products as we reposition our offerings to better serve low-income and complex lives. Touching on the important topic of Stars, we received the final Star rating results along with the rest of the industry 2 weeks ago. The final Stars results for this cycle were consistent with our July and September commentary, where we expected 2/3 of our membership associated with contracts showing year-over-year raw score improvement.\nThat result was approximately 73%. We also said we are expecting roughly 90% of our membership to be associated with contracts rated 3 stars or higher, and that final result was 87%. While we delivered Stars results in line with our Q2 expectations, these results certainly do not reflect the ambition of this organization. They do, however, represent an important step on our journey to improve quality scores and restored Medicare Advantage earnings power. Relative to our ongoing work to strengthen Medicare execution overall, we continue to see improvement in our operating metrics, which are important indicators for member experience and ultimately, Star scores.\nOur first call resolution has improved year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as have our customer satisfaction scores. We are still tracking a roughly 40% reduction in member complaints year-over-year and consistently delivering service levels in the high 90% and we continue to build out our network, including adding 6,100 new providers in the quarter and moving more than 12,000 members into new value-based agreements.\nMedicare Advantage remains an integral part of our portfolio of businesses, strategically aligned with our Medicaid and Marketplace platforms and a long-term driver of both earnings and growth. We remain committed to and focused on the work necessary to improve overall performance and quality on behalf of our Medicare members. Before I turn it over to Drew, let me touch briefly on our value creation work. We continue to make progress against the many initiatives that will focus and fortify our enterprise to support robust long-term growth.\nAs our first wave of operational redesign work matures, we are evolving our focus for those initiatives to optimizing and automating workflows as we look to support more efficient and effective service for our members and providers. For the initial installations of our new telephony system, we are now layering on additional features that are driving month-over-month improvement in self-service. And over the last few months, within our now centralized utilization management teams, we have been focused on reducing provider abrasion by expanding the use of our proprietary tool, CATA, automates the approval of authorizations for clinically appropriate procedures using AI technology we developed in collaboration with Apixio.\nSpeaking of technology, I'm particularly excited about the data work we have accelerated over the last few quarters as we look to aggressively build out an integrated data fabric across Centene to support our long-term technology strategy. One of the benefits of taking this work on now is that we can leverage the most modern technology and design our infrastructure to account for the ways in which we foresee both traditional AI and generative AI being deployed in our environments to automate administration, support more seamless provider collaboration and optimize clinical insights will transform our members' health journeys across lines of business.\nOne quick milestone from this work. Over the last 3 quarters, we have significantly increased the number of digital clinical sources into our clinical data hub, where we hold a longitudinal health record for our members. The expansion of clinical data from digital sources is expected to reduce the overall cost and improve the accuracy and timeliness of information we can use to solve for gaps in care, understand member risk and acuity and support predictive modeling for care management interventions.\nThere are a number of other operational and digital initiatives in flight across our value creation portfolio, and we look forward to providing updates and proof points for those as we move into and through 2024. But it is important to note that increasingly, this work is carrying momentum not because of the value creation scorecard. But because it is simply part of the disciplined operating DNA we are building across the company.\nFrom a portfolio review standpoint, we were pleased to reach a definitive agreement to divest Circle Health earlier this quarter. Circle is an excellent asset with a strong management team, and we took our time to find the right partner who will continue to support the good work circle is doing to serve communities in the U.K. We continue to expect this deal to close in Q1 of next year and to be $0.03 to $0.04 accretive to 2024.\nThere are a few remaining assets we continue to evaluate and reposition, but we are now in the final innings of this work and expect that as we get to mid-2024, we will be focused on building around our solid strategic and streamlined core business. Finally, I want to touch on our PBM migration. Given its importance to our 2024 financial targets, but more importantly, given the value we expect it will drive for our customers and members. The teams have put in an enormous amount of work over the last few months and continue to make great progress against our key milestones.\nIn fact, earlier this month, we got to see an early but important proof point of how well these teams are working together on behalf of our customers due to a 10/1 migration of one of our health plans from a legacy platform over to ESI. Thanks to thoughtful planning and testing ahead of time and strong collaboration and communication during the cutover, this was a very successful transition, and we believe it sends a great signal about the health of this project as we move into Q4. Overall, Centene continues to generate positive momentum. We are making important strides operationally, fortifying the foundation of the business and increasingly leveraging our size and scale to better serve our customers.\nStrategically, as you've seen through our divestitures, we have sharpened the focus of the enterprise on our 3 core business lines and continue to work hard to preserve the unique innovation engine of our local health plans. These advancements, along with our 2023 outperformance give us confidence that we will exceed our 2024 earnings floor of $6.60 and continued to demonstrate improved member and provider experiences. With that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported third quarter 2023 results of $35 billion in premium and service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2 up over 50% from $1.30 in Q3 of 2022. This represents a $0.20 beat to our internal forecast that we tried to recalibrate you to in early September. Our Q3 consolidated HBR was 87%, a little bit better than our expectation, driven by the commercial segment. This keeps us right on track with our full year HBR guidance range.\nMedicaid at 90.7% was fundamentally on track other than one of our states providing a draft and incomplete rate update retroactive to 4123. This was worth about 40 basis points in the quarter relative to our expectations. Other than that unique item, which we would expect to be a timing matter with a favorable future resolution. We continue to be on track in Medicaid including relative to our acuity estimates that we've been tracking since the recommencement of redeterminations on April 1, 2023.\nAs you can see in the membership tables, we are down 1.1 million Medicaid members since 3/31 '23, right on track with our forecast that include redetermination estimates. That $1.1 million includes Iowa reshuffling of about 83,000 members effective July 1 as expected. To update a statistic we previously provided, 13 of our 14 states in the 7/1 to 10/1 cohort have included acuity adjustments in our rates. One is still outstanding. And so far, 7 of our 1124 cohort states have provided draft rates that include acuity adjustments overall, consistent with our estimates.\nOur view of 2024 Medicaid performance is unchanged, other than revenue looks to be a little stronger than the $77 billion we outlined on our Q1 call. At Investor Day, we'll provide more detail on 2024 guidance. Medicare was on track at 82.2%, an improvement of 170 basis points from Q3 of 2022. Similarly, our view of Medicare 2024 performance is consistent with what we shared previously. And as you finish modeling 2023, make sure you factor in the Q4 2023 Medicare HBR step-up, including the previously discussed premium deficiency reserve.\nThe commercial HBR at 78.9% in Q3 continues to be strong and better than expected. Simultaneously, we are also capturing growth from both redeterminations and the special enrollment period. We said on the Q2 call that we expected to hit 3.6 million members this year, and we accomplished that as of the end of Q3. You may recall that last quarter, we grew 200,000 members. This quarter, we grew 386,000 members. This continued growth and HBR performance in 2023 sets us up well to achieve our previously stated goal of growing marketplace, at least $3 billion of revenue in 2024 while also expanding margin.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter compared to 8.3% last year, consistent with our mix of business. Cash flow provided by operations was $1 billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by net earnings. Our domestic unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at quarter end was $231 million. During the third quarter, we repurchased 11.6 million shares of our common stock for $773 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 22.9 million shares for $1.58 billion, a little over our goal of $1.5 billion for 2023.\nOur debt to adjusted EBITDA ticked down to 2.8x. Our medical claims liability totaled $17.1 billion at quarter end and represents 53 days in claims payable up 1 day from Q2 of 2023. Outside of adjusted earnings, during the third quarter, we announced the divestiture of Circle, our U.K. hospital company, which triggers a noncash write-down of goodwill. We also adjusted the carrying value of our U.K. physician business. You can see these and other items in the table in our press release.\nWe are pleased with the performance of the company in the first 3 quarters of the year and are increasing our outlook to at least $6.60 of adjusted EPS for 2023. As Sarah mentioned, this puts us at greater than 14% adjusted EPS growth in 2023 after posting 12% in 2022, 2 pretty good years. The press release table has other 2023 guidance elements, including no change in HBR or SG&A ranges and $0.5 billion more in premium revenue. We also still forecast investment in other income, a little over $1 billion, excluding divestiture gains and losses.\nAs we are almost at 2024, which we will go into more detail at our Investor Day in a little over 6 weeks, we continue to have confidence in our 2024 adjusted EPS floor of greater than $6.60. In fact, the strength of this quarter is another data point that increases our confidence. While I do spend a lot of my time talking about and driving margin, let me close by talking about growth because Centene is a combination, margin expansion and growth investment opportunity.\nOn growth, Medicaid expansion is coming to North Carolina late this year. Our Oklahoma win in both broad Medicaid and sole source foster care is on track to commence 4124 and there's a pipeline of complex populations expected to come into managed care over the next few years. One example being the recent Georgia RFP as Sarah referenced, Marketplace has proven to be an excellent franchise and asset for this company. This business today produces more revenue than our Medicare Advantage business, and that will widen in 2024. And even our PDP business, which may be small in relative revenue should grow meaningfully in 2024, these members produce pharmacy spend and our potential MAPD candidates down the road.\nWe're excited about the future and our ability to power through 2024 and come out the other side post divestitures, post redeterminations and on our way to fixing Medicare a better company than in 2021. On the other side of 2024, we look forward to driving a 12% to 15% long-term adjusted EPS CAGR. Thank you for your interest in Centene. Rocco will take questions now."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. Ken Fasola, Centene's President, will also be available as a participant during Q&A.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2023, and other public SEC filings.\nCentene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.\nThe call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures, with the most directly comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our second quarter 2023 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section. The company is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain 2024 measures to the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Centene's Q2 earnings call.\nOur second quarter performance demonstrated Centene's ability to deliver solid results amid a dynamic health care landscape. We reported $2.10 of adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter and lifted our 2023 premium and service revenue forecast by another $1.8 billion. We now expect to deliver at least $6.45 of adjusted EPS for full year 2023, a $0.05 increase compared to April guidance.\nWe are proud of the progress we are making with respect to the execution of our strategy, achieving operational milestones, while delivering on the financial commitments we've made to our shareholders. Importantly, our balanced portfolio of core businesses delivered strong second quarter financials, with marketplace growth and Medicaid performance both running slightly ahead of expectation.\nLet me provide a few updates related to our progress in each business line, and then share the latest on our value creation work. Let's start with Medicaid.\nSince our Q1 call, Medicaid redeterminations have formally kicked off in every one of our 30 active states. The time our team spent over the last 18 months preparing for redeterminations has positioned us well to support our state partners, establishing timely information exchange and shared workflow as well as reaching out directly to members to provide education around process and enrollment options.\nYear-to-date, we have made 9 million outreach attempts, with early indications of higher-than-normal member engagement. These outreach efforts, inclusive of more than 15,000 community events, also contribute to our ability to recapture members, even if initially disenrolled as part of redeterminations. We are actively tracking the number of members that we are recapturing post-procedural disenrollment and expect the percentage to meaningfully advance as this process unfolds.\nAt an enterprise level, net Medicaid membership is consistent with expectations. We have seen ebbs and flows from month to month as states continue to evolve and refine their processes. Given the recent news that CMS is requiring states -- certain states to pause redeterminations and reinstate members who were dropped for procedural reasons, we will be closely tracking any impact this may have on the membership slope over the next few months.\nMuch of the redeterminations' journey remains ahead, and we continue to monitor the major levers, including rate, acuity and membership. Based on our most recent analysis and informed by member lists and acuity projections from our state partners, our expectation around member acuity for 2023 remains unchanged.\nAs we assess who is staying versus leaving, we are tracking consistent with the acuity modeling we discussed on our first quarter call in April. Medicaid rate conversations continue to be constructive. We are consistently seeing states take acuity adjustments into consideration in their rate updates. And at an enterprise level, we remain on track with our expectations for 2023.\nOverall, we are grateful for the partnership and trust placed with us by the states we serve and for the leadership CMS has shown in helping us to ensure that eligible Medicaid members do not experience unnecessary coverage gaps as states work through the unprecedented scale of this redetermination process.\nFrom a Medicaid business development standpoint, we chalked an exciting new business win in June, as our team in Oklahoma was selected by the Oklahoma Healthcare Authority for statewide contracts to provide managed care for the SoonerSelect and SoonerSelect Children's Specialty Plan programs. The team delivered a strong RFP response and was the sole source winner for the Children's Specialty program, designed to serve children and families involved in the child welfare and juvenile systems, including foster care. This represents Centene's 31st state and our sixth Sole Source Foster Care contract.\nOverall, Medicaid, our largest and longest-running business, delivered strong results in the second quarter, and our market teams continue to prove the value of the local approach, demonstrating innovative and comprehensive support for our members and state partners as we continue to execute against redeterminations in the coming months and quarters.\nTurning to Medicare. Our quarter-end membership was 1.3 million, with approximately 47% of Medicare Advantage lives associated with value-based care arrangements, a 300-basis-point increase from Investor Day as we've added key BBC partners to our network. Second quarter results reflect some slightly higher outpatient claims experience within Medicare during the month of May. Drew will provide more detail on this as well as our bid posture for 2024, but it is worth noting that our increased 2023 adjusted EPS guidance incorporates our latest view of trend and pockets of slightly higher Medicare utilization in the back half of the year should that occur.\nGiven our discussion in Q1 around Star, I'd like to provide an update on what we expect to see in October and what we are seeing year-to-date around Star's improvement efforts that will inform future results. As a reminder, on our Q1 call in April, I shared that we expected minimal progress in 4-star plans, but that we anticipated solid overall contract improvement, reflecting the operational investments we have made. With more complete program data, our projection show some more pressure on 4-star results, but we are still expecting solid overall contract progression, thanks to strong improvements in admin and ops and pharmacy measures, which have been our focus in this first cycle.\nWith several contracts close to the bubble, variability in cut points means we could end the cycle with no 4-star contracts compared to our current single contract representing 2.7% of members. While this is disappointing, we do expect to see meaningful movement in our 3- and 3.5-star bands in October, and roughly 2/3 of our members are in plans showing year-over-year improvement. Pulling up these underperforming contracts represents tangible progress in delivering economic value to Medicare as we look to 2025 and beyond.\nAs a reminder, in Q1, we reset our quality strategy to maximize contracts that reach the 3.5-star threshold, consistent with our renewed focus on serving complex and dual-eligible members beginning with our 2024 bids. Put simply, Star strategy is different when you're managing complex and duals populations. Strong performance at 3.5 stars with Centene's target member mix will give our Medicare business the economics necessary to serve these populations well and support our multiyear performance goals.\nWith this in mind, we have set a revised target of reaching 85% of members in 3.5 star plans by October of 2025. We are closely monitoring in-year Star metrics and continue to see important markers of sustained improvement, consistent with our remarks on the Q1 call. A few examples include: a 27% reduction in year-over-year call volumes resulting from a redesigned member onboarding process that features digital outreach and member self service; consistent 4-star performance in our core admin and ops metrics; call center service levels for members, providers and brokers at or above target with first call resolution in the mid-80s; year-to-date, member provider and broker satisfaction scores in the mid-90s and the addition of 24,000 new physicians across our Medicare network year-to-date as we look to ensure robust access options for our members.\nMedicare Advantage provides Centene with an important opportunity to serve low-income and medically complex seniors. It also represents a significant long-term earnings opportunity as we strengthen the overall performance and trajectory of our program.\nMoving to marketplace. Our Ambetter Health franchise continues to outperform. This truly differentiated asset creates a unique growth opportunity for Centene, both near and long term. We ended the quarter with 3.3 million marketplace lives exceeding our previous projections.\nOur strong membership results were driven by strategic product design, long-standing and differentiated broker relationships and overall market growth. Our large and growing marketplace platform is well positioned to provide coverage to beneficiaries losing Medicaid eligibility from redeterminations, and we are leveraging our networks and engagement tools to support members during this transition.\nWhere states allow, we are educating our Medicaid members about marketplace options and are working to proactively communicate with members who we predict will likely be eligible for marketplace in order to preserve continuity of coverage.\nDuring just May and June, Ambetter Health successfully outreached to potential members with more than 160,000 digital touch points via e-mail or SMS as part of our redetermination efforts. We expect this dynamic will continue to fuel growth in marketplace throughout the remainder of the year and into 2024.\nFinally, our value-creation initiatives are advancing well. We continue to take a rigorous approach to streamlining core SG&A as we focus and fortify the organization for the future. This includes additional work to standardize our operating model, while maintaining the hyper local care that differentiates Centene in the market.\nThe implementation of our new PBM contract remains on track, as we've achieved all first half 2023 milestones and look forward to our first go-live dates in early 2024. Our portfolio review work also continues. And in June, we closed the divestiture of Apixio to New Mountain Capital. We structured the transaction to maintain an ownership position as well as a long-term contract because of our view that Apixio's proven artificial intelligence tools are uniquely positioned for this moment in health care technology. We believe that partnering with New Mountain will allow Apixio to innovate rapidly through continued investment, while we continue as an influential customer and minority owner. This is a great example of our thoughtful efforts to maximize long-term value as we reposition noncore assets.\nIn parallel, as our value-creation efforts create operating bandwidths, we continue to build our M&A pipeline and look forward to diversifying our capital deployment as strategic opportunities for inorganic growth emerge.\nOverall, Centene delivered another quarter of solid financial results, while executing against a robust list of transformative initiatives to move our company forward. With half of 2023 in the books, we are excited to leverage our positive momentum as we work to support our state partners throughout the duration of redeterminations, maintain our leadership position in marketplace, and strategically realign our Medicare Advantage business, building momentum around Star and positioning our products for long-term growth and profitability.\nCentene's improved earnings power in 2023 is a direct result of the focus and hard work that our organization is demonstrating every single day across our markets. We remain confident in our ability to achieve greater than $6.60 of adjusted earnings per share in 2024 as we continue to execute against our strategic framework, creating value for members, customers and shareholders alike.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Drew to review the quarter and our financial outlook in more detail. Drew?\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, WellCare Health Plans, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported second quarter 2023 results of $35 billion in premium and service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.10, up over 18% from $1.77 in Q2 of 2022. Our Q2 consolidated HBR was 87.0%, consistent with our expectation and on track with our full year guidance range. Medicaid at 88.9% was a little favorable from the item that we mentioned on the first quarter call, and so far so good on matching rates with acuity, though it is still early in the redetermination process.\nMedicare at 86.2% was a little higher in the quarter than planned as we also saw May outpatient incurred claims higher than the January through April period, largely in outpatient surgery. With respect to progression, May outpatient trend was higher than April, then it came down in June. July so far is steady with June. Inpatient was on track, and our previous guidance already assumed a Q1 Medicare HBR favorability would not continue.\nThe commercial HBR of 81% was consistent with our expectations, inclusive of continued strong marketplace growth of 200,000 members in the quarter. Recall that special enrollment period members start with a lower margin profile and therefore, higher HBR than full year members, due in part to risk adjustment mechanics, where the shorter duration doesn't get full credit for health conditions. Though if retained for the following year, the SEP cohort has proven to be attractive. Our guidance contemplates growth to a peak of approximately 3.6 million members in Q4.\nOn the topic of marketplace risk adjustment, 2022 was recently finalized by CMS, and we received our first view of the 2023 risk adjustment from the Wakely data in June and July. Overall, no surprises in marketplace risk adjustment. And as of June 30, we have lowered our booked risk adjustment revenue estimates by a cumulative $314 million given the financial condition of a couple of marketplace competitors.\nThough we have made this prudent adjustment to our revenue over each of the past 5 quarters, we plan on fully asserting our rights to collect what we are owed for risk adjustment. To be clear, we have already absorbed this $314 million hit, and this was the biggest reconciling item between the CMS published amount owed to us for 2022 and what was on our books prior to June of 2023.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the second quarter compared to 8.2% last year, consistent with our updated mix of business. Cash flow provided by operations was $2.5 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by net earnings and the timing of premium payments from our state partners. Our domestic unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at quarter end was $200 million.\nDuring the second quarter and through July, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of our common stock for $700 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 15.4 million shares for $1.08 billion. We also reduced debt by $300 million in the quarter and achieved debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9x. Our medical claims liability totaled $17 billion at quarter end and represents 52 days in claims payable compared to 54 in Q1 of '23 and 55 in Q2 of '22. The decrease was driven by state-directed payments that we collected over prior quarters and paid out in a lump sum in Q2, the largest related to California Hospital and Prop 56 payments, representing $713 million or 2.2 days sequentially.\nOutside of adjusted earnings during the second quarter, divestiture activity produced a net $0.11 gain in the quarter, and we also recognized additional real estate impairments of $0.02, consistent with our ongoing real estate optimization initiatives.\nNow let's turn to the full year of 2023. We are pleased with the performance of the company in the first half of the year and are increasing our outlook to at least $6.45 of adjusted EPS for 2023. We are increasing 2023 premium and service revenue by $1.8 billion to reflect an additional $800 million of state-directed payments as well as refinement in Medicaid and Marketplace premium revenue progression throughout the year.\nOur 2023 guidance continues to include an approximate $200 million premium deficiency reserve for Medicare, as we discussed on the Q1 call. The PDR would be recorded in Q4 of 2023. 2023 guidance also includes a little over $1 billion in investment income, excluding divestiture gain and losses.\nTo go a little bit deeper in Medicaid for 2023, during our first quarter call, we discussed many of our assumptions related to redeterminations that supported our forward projections. We have continued to monitor the actual member data against our projections by state and subpopulation. And as of July, we are tracking consistent with that updated forecast that we provided in April.\nThe matching of rates to acuity continues to be a very important lever for the company as we navigate the redeterminations process. Fourteen of our 30 states provide rate updates between 7 1 and 10 1 each year. Twelve of those have provided us rates, all of which include acuity adjustments. The other two are still working on rate updates. And based upon discussions, we expect those also to include acuity adjustments.\nBeyond 2023, we are continually assessing our positioning for 2024, whether analyzing redetermination data and rate actions, assessing our 2024 bid assumptions in Medicare against current data, or examining our continued growth and performance of marketplace. Accordingly, we continue to have confidence in our 2024 adjusted EPS floor of greater than $6.60.\nTo give you a little bit more color on 2024, that 6 60 has an embedded forecasted ballpark $0.80 loss from Medicare Advantage. In other words, if we were merely breakeven in Medicare Advantage in 2024, that 6 60 would be approximately 7 40.\nLet me close by addressing some of the concerns I've heard over the past few months. Number one, redeterminations. Our early results are playing out well compared to our assumptions, and states understand that in order to have actuarial soundness, acuity adjustments are necessary. Still plenty of execution ahead, but being on track is a good start.\nNumber two, Medicare trend. We came into the year assuming double-digit outpatient trend, and did so again for 2024. And as you know, our Medicare business is under construction for 2024, as we are investing in certain products and pulling back in others. Based upon current forecasts, we expect our Medicare segment to produce approximately 14% of our premium and service revenue in 2024 compared to 16% in the current quarter. And any change in our view of 2024 margin in Medicare, better or worse by the time we get to the fourth quarter of 2023, merely flexes the PDR we booked in 2023 up or down.\nNumber three, growth. We couldn't be more pleased with our performance in the Oklahoma RFP for both broad Medicaid and foster care, and we look forward to the State of North Carolina implementing Medicaid expansion. We continue to execute well in marketplace, where our industry-best overall position has enabled us to grow marketplace membership 62% year-over-year.\nAnd while yes, we have to get through the rest of redeterminations, we still have value creation initiatives to execute upon and we have years of work ahead on Stars, there's a lot to like here. So while the market trades us at 10 to 11x earnings, we'll keep on executing, buying Centene shares and building up our M&A pipeline to acquire as we create operational capacity.\nThank you for your interest in Centene. Operator, Rocco, you can open the line up for questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer, and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centine will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centine.com.\n\nKen Fazola, Centines President, and Jim Murray, our Chief Operating Officer, will also be available as participants during Q&A.\n\nAny remarks that SENTU may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Security's litigation reform act of 1995.\n\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centins' most recent Form 10K, filed on February 21, 2023, and other public SEC violins.\n\nCentin anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change.\n\nWhile the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.\n\nThe call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2023 press release.\n\nwhich is available on the company's website under the Investors section.\n\nThe company is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain 2024 measures to the corresponding GAT measures without unreasonable efforts.\n\ndue to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range.\n\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO Sarah London.\n\nThank you, Jen. And thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our first quarter 2023 results and update both our 2023 guidance and 2024 EPS floor.\n\nCentene's first quarter results were strong, reflecting continued positive momentum operationally and the beginning of another year of disciplined execution against our strategic framework.\n\nWe reported $2.11 of adjusted deluded EPS for the quarter and listed our Premium and service revenue forecast by another $3.7 billion. How many ordered\n\nWe also moved our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to at least $6.40, the top of our original range.\n\nAt the same time, as you saw from the press release, we have updated our 2024 adjusted EPS floor to greater than $6.60.\n\nGiven the focus on 2024, let me start there by providing more detailed commentary on our insights and current thinking.\n\nThen I'll come back to 2023 and our recent progress.\n\nA year ago, when I stepped into this role, we were in the early stages of executing against a three-year value creation plan.\n\nWe saw no reason to change that plan as its basic pillars were rock solid.\n\nStreamline the company by focusing on our core businesses.\n\nPrice our products for profitable growth.\n\nModernize our business processes and tools and deploy capital in a disciplined manner to create enterprise and shareholder value.\n\nAfter 13 months in this role, I am even more convinced that this organization has the capacity to deliver substantially more value to our customers and shareholders.\n\nThis team has a clear vision for how we intend to execute and transform in a sustainable way as we set ourselves up for the long term. And we are confident in our long-term growth algorithm.\n\nWe also have the benefit of a far more complete view of the near-term dynamics we will need to navigate, and the investments required to ensure Centene is positioned for market leadership.\n\nThat combined insight is the underpinning of our revised 2024 earnings floor.\n\nI'll outline the major drivers of our decision, and Drew will walk through the numbers and mechanics in more detail.\n\nThe first and most significant driver is Medicaid redeterminations.\n\nOver the last month and a half, with the benefit of finalized implementation plans and early data feeds from our state partners, we have refreshed our state level models and projections to inform an updated view of the potential impact to membership and acuity of the redeterminations process across our 31 health plans.\n\nBased on that analysis, 2023 progression looks slightly better. But we now believe it is prudent to build in a more conservative view of the potential disconnect between rates and acuity that could manifest in some of our states in 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, we view any disconnect as a temporary one. We fully expect that states will ultimately provide sufficient rate adjustments to reflect any changes in acuity of the Medicaid population. But we are building a provision in our 2024 target in case there is a gap in timing in some of our states. We remain committed to ensuring that the most vulnerable members of our communities have ongoing\n\n24 Medicare BIDS Strategy.\n\nAs we evaluated the final 2024 CMS rates, our view of potential 2025 program dynamics and the strengths we saw in 2023 performance, we decided to use 2024 as an opportunity to more aggressively right size our membership and focus on our core member base.\n\nThis will move us away from some of the membership that resulted from a growth at all costs pricing mentality during the 21 and 22 annual enrollment periods and create a solid foundation from which to drive earnings power in the back half of the decade.\n\nAt the same time, we see an opportunity to make targeted investment in Medicare that enhance our ability to reach and serve these members.\n\nThese include own distribution capacity, provider enablement tools to support value-based care, and the acceleration of digital capabilities that will truly differentiate the well-care, member, and provider experiences going forward. Given the fundamental impact this strategy will have on member mix.\n\nas well as the changes CMS recently announced to the STARS program. We are also resetting our multi-year quality target, given that we will be managing members who are naturally more complex from a quality standpoint.\n\nOur focus over the next few years will be to maximize contracts that reach the 3.5-star threshold and to begin laying the groundwork for the Health Equity Index Adjustment that CMS will measure starting in 2024 and 2025. Drew will walk through the mechanics but given our target populations.\n\nWe believe a near-term focus on maximizing 3.5-star plus results when combined with an adjustment from the health equity index when implemented will most efficiently provide both the long-term quality profile and the economics necessary for well-care to be competitive in our segment.\n\nFor the upcoming October results, we are trending pre-caps between 14 and 18% membership and four-star plans, but we have one large contract on the bubble that represents 10% of our members. For those still watching that metric, we are conservatively assuming the downside scenario and therefore expect minimal four-star progression year-over-year.\n\nbut we expect to see solid overall contract improvement reflecting the operational progress we have made. And we have paid to conservative view of these results into our overall assumptions.\n\nUltimately, we believe that returning to WellCare's roots in serving lower income, diverse, and complex seniors is an anchoring position in what will be the fastest growing subsegment of the Medicare Advantage market and one that aligns perfectly with our local community integrated model and our Medicaid footprint. We are investing today to protect and enhance this business because we...\n\necosystem, we see an opportunity to future proof our target architecture, expand and modernize our data layer, and build a digital operating structure centered around our customer relationships.\n\nDone correctly, this work will accelerate our transformation, allowing us to tap into the power of Centines' unique local data footprint, automate more of our core functions.\n\ndrive innovative clinical models and deliver market leading customer experiences across all three of our businesses. We recognize the significance of increasing near-term investments at the expense of adjusted earnings per share.\n\nUltimately, we are confident these investments will fortify the foundation of the enterprise and accelerate capabilities that will position us well against our long-term growth thesis.\n\nLet me close out this portion of the 2024 discussion by emphasizing a few final points. 1. We do not intend to update this number between now and our annual investor day in December .\n\nTwo, our goal is to provide you with as much detail and transparency as we possibly can about our assumptions without compromising our competitive strategy during the bid cycle.\n\nThis includes the improved segment reporting you can find beginning this quarter in our 10Q.\n\nAnd three, this is the number we are confident in.\n\nAs some of you have been correct to point out, a floor is not a finish line, and $6.60 for 2024 is not our finish line. This is a number that we intend to meet and beat.\n\nBefore I turn it over to Drew, I want to comment briefly on progress in 2023 because performance this year presents an opportunity to strengthen the position from which we navigate through 2024, and we are executing well in 2023 thus far. Our local teams were fully mobilized to support the beginning of re-determinations on April 1st.\n\nAlthough by the time planning was complete, only two of our states chose this as their start date. The remaining 28 states are evenly distributed across May, June , and July start dates.\n\nIn general, states are pursuing a balanced mix of population-based and time-based approaches. Recent changes to implementation plans have biased to later start dates.\n\nreflecting the unprecedented scale of the undertaking for many states. Our focus from the beginning has been maximizing coverage continuity, both for Medicaid eligible and for marketplace potential members, and we are executing well against that goal.\n\nWe have robust multi-channel communications in place for every state. In states where we have already commenced with early member communications, we are seeing positive early indicators, including low opt out rates for text messages and higher engagement than normal in outbound live call campaigns.\n\nwe are using them to refine the analytics driving our outreach campaigns and to inform productive discussions with state actuaries and our regulator partners.\n\nLeveraging Centines Local Approach, we have deployed community-based provider education and engagement campaigns with a focus on educating our FQHC partners as well as key provider partners in every region, so our members have the benefit of multiple trusted sources of information as they navigate this process.\n\nFor members losing eligibility, we have launched both Direct and Indirect Outreach campaigns to educate them about their marketplace options.\n\nAcross all 25 states where we have an overlap between our Medicaid and Ambetter footprints, we have activated our unique and comprehensive Ambetter Broker Network so they are prepared to support members transitioning to the marketplace.\n\nAnd we are working closely with states where we are able to do direct outreach to members to facilitate warm handoffs in the enrollment process.\n\nIn short, our teams are hard at work supporting members and continuing to build positive momentum with our state partners. Turning to Marketplace, as we've discussed, Centines and Better Product Line experienced incredible growth during the 2023 Open Enrollment.\n\nThis positive momentum continued during the first quarter and we closed the quarter with more than 3 million marketplace members.\n\nAs we move through 2023, we continue to monitor new member demographics and overall claims data consistent with the rigorous tracking that occurred during the first quarter.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the proven breadth and depths of Ambetter's broker network, a clear driver of OEP success, will also be a key differentiator as we look to maximize the catchers' mid opportunity. Overall, we continue to view the marketplace as a durable coverage vehicle.\n\nand AMBETTER as a market leader in this space continues to represent a powerful organic growth opportunity for Centine.\n\nFrom a Medicare standpoint, while we are working through a strategic rebuild, it is important to note the strong underlying operational improvements we are seeing that align with our five-point plan.\n\nExamples include a new center of excellence for Medicare calls that has reduced per member per month's calls by almost 25%.\n\nThe implementation of new AI-based call sentiment technology resulting in real-time performance improvement. A 20% reduction in voluntary disenrollments and a 47% reduction in CTMs year-over-year. We have added almost 1,400 new clinics under value-based contracts and have added more than 1,000 new clinics to our new AI-based call sentiment technology.\n\nAnd most importantly, we are seeing member, provider, and broker satisfaction scores in the mid-90s year to date.\n\nWe are on a journey, but there is tangible improvement, and we continue to build operating momentum as we progress through 2023.\n\nFinally, a quick update on our Value Creation Initiative, which remains front and center as we work to fortify the foundation of the business.\n\nOverall, we are tracking ahead of our SGNA goals, excluding the additional investments I mentioned earlier, and our Slate of SGNA initiatives is progressing well against key milestones. We continue to streamline the organization through portfolio rationalization, closing three transactions in January , and more work is underway.\n\nAnd finally, importantly, our PBM implementation is on track across all workstreams. In short, 2023 is shaping up to be another strong year of execution and earnings performance, and we expect to gather further momentum as we progress through the year that will help us to power through our updated 2024 floor.\n\nAnd while we are changing our earnings past two and through 2024, something we certainly don't take lightly, we have not changed our focus, our strategy, or our confidence in the ultimate earnings power of this organization and its long-term growth potential.\n\nWe are not just building a company for 2024. We are making the decisions today that will enable us to deliver 12 to 15 percent adjusted EPS growth in the back half of the decade and ensure Centene is the market leader in government sponsored programs for years to come.\n\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Drew to walk through the details of Q1 and the interplay between 2023 and a new prudent floor for 2024 that we will work to beat.\n\nI'll hand it over to Drew to walk through the details of Q1 and the interplay between 2023 and a new prudent floor for 2024 that we will work to beat. Drew?\n\nThank you, Sarah. This was a very good quarter as you can see in the press release. Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was ahead of our expectations and a good start to the year. Let me hit a few key items for Q1 and then spend most of my time on the remainder of 2023 and 2024. Premium and service revenue at $35 billion was strong in Q1. The HBR was...\n\n0.0% was on track as well and reflects two items.\n\n1, a delay in a 2022 rate increase from one of our largest states, which we expect to favorably impact our Q2 2023 Medicaid HBR. 2, Senate Bill 510 in California dealing with prior period COVID claims.\n\nThose two items pushed up the Medicaid HBR over 40 basis points in the quarter. The Medicare HBR 85.2% was a little better than expectations.\n\nMarketplace revenue was stronger than expected while the commercial HBR at 76.3% was in line with our internal forecast. Q1 cash flow from operations was strong, even when excluding a few out of period items such as early Medicare premiums. Overall, this was another good quarter with sound fundamentals.\n\nIn the last month and a half, we've gone through a rigorous process, not just to refine the forecast for the remainder of 2023 in our typical 3-plus-9 process, but we also accelerated what we could to develop a more detailed forecast for 2024.\n\nLet's tackle 2023 and then get to 2024.\n\nFor the full year of 2023 premium and service revenue is coming in stronger than our last midpoint of 132.5 billion driven by Medicaid and marketplace.\n\nMedicaid revenue improvement is largely due to the refinement of timing of redeterminations in 2023 versus 2024. As an example, as we entered April , one of our largest states provided updated clarity around foster care redeterminations, moving the start date from April 1 to September 1.\n\nAnd they also clarified the timing of other populations, resulting in a start date one month later than we had planned, resulting in more Medicaid member months in 2023. In Marketplace, we are very pleased to be leveraging our number one market position to not only seize market growth but also increase market share. We finished the open enrollment period strong and that carried into the special-\n\nCP and Roles in 2022 or today.\n\nThough we have found that partial year SEP members' profitability is below that of open enrollment members, largely due to risk adjustment mechanics, the ability to renew those same members on 1-1-24 will set us up well for 2024. Consistent with what we shared on the Q4 earnings call, the demographic data\n\nincluding subsidy eligibility and product mix continues to look encouraging. Product positioning and distribution execution are also strong. The overall individual market has grown more than expected this year, and this macro growth is a positive factor when considering risk pools. Overall, we are able to absorb this additional growth in 2023.\n\nAnd this should provide an earnings tailwind for 2024 to help offset other areas of headwind.\n\nWe are lifting the 2023 Consolidated Premium and Service Revenue, another $3.7 billion to a midpoint of approximately $136 billion driven by Medicaid and Marketplace.\n\nA revised 2023 HBR reflects an overall 10 basis point improvement to a range of 87.1 to 87.7%.\n\nThis is driven by a few net items. First of all, there's a slight shift in mix due to growth in marketplace, which has a structurally lower HBR.\n\nAnd as we'll talk about in a minute, we now expect a 10 basis point improvement in Medicaid in 2023 versus previous guidance.\n\nA revised HBR also reflects a specific nuance for Medicare.\n\nI mentioned on the February earnings call that we expect to lose money in Medicare Advantage in 2024.\n\nBased upon our latest underwriting estimates, we have reflected in 2023 guidance in the Proximate 200 million Premium Deficiency Reserve or PDR, which we would expect to record in the fourth quarter of 2023. Other than that, our fundamental HBR is good in Q1 and on track for 2023.\n\ndemonstrating the current strength of the business.\n\nOn the flip side, growth at marketplace, with more than two and a half times the S-GNA rate of Medicaid, doing part to distribution costs and exchange fees, changes the mix for S-GNA.\n\nWhen coupled with investments in quality and other key areas Sarah mentioned, our adjusted SGNA Guidance for 2023 is up to a midpoint of 8.9%.\n\nwith investments in quality and other key areas Sarah mentioned, our adjusted SG&A guidance for 2023 is up to a midpoint of 8.9%. Let me demonstrate the impact to mix.\n\nSomeone recently asked, why our sgna rate isn't in the low 7s?\n\nActually, if you pro forma our 2023 revenue mix as if we were 80% Medicaid, we would be in the low 7s. something that we could close out.\n\nOf course, in addition to our number one position in Medicaid, we like having the number one marketplace franchise, the number two PDP franchise, and a Medicare Advantage business with over a million members across 36 states.\n\nInvestment and other income was strong in Q1 and we expect that to continue for the remainder of the year at a midpoint of $975 million.\n\nWe have bought back 577 million of shares since the beginning of the year, including 300 million post the Q4 call toward our approximate $1.5 billion dollar goal for 2023. We expect to continue the majority of our health plan dividends to come late in the year.\n\nAs of today, we have an approximate deluded share count of 550 million shares. As we generate cash at the parent, we plan to deploy it to buy back our shares. For instance, in April , we were able to monetize the stock consideration we received at the closing of our sale of Magellan specialty.\n\nwe seized this opportunity so that we could deploy to share buyback. Overall for 2023, inclusive of the items we just covered, we are lifting our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to at least $6.40, the top of our original guidance range. Let's move to 2024.\n\nOn 2024, while we were previously targeting 715 of adjusted EPS, we are reducing that to greater than 660 based upon more visibility on key 2024 drivers. While we are determined to do better than 660,\n\nBased upon what we know today, we believe this is a prudent target for our 2024 earnings.\n\nAnd we believe this is the right jump off point to apply our long-term growth algorithm, CAGR, of 12-15% for the back half of the decade, consistent with what we shared with you on December investor day. Let me outline our approach and key assumptions to this revised 2024 target.\n\nstarting with Medicaid. The first redeterminations just started April 1st, but what has transpired over the past month and a half has enabled us to gain more clarity on each state's process in terms of timing and approach to the sequencing of populations.\n\nAs Sarah mentioned, we have also been able to refine acuity projections, state-by-state subpopulation by subpopulation, as well as the anticipated degree in timing of projected rate actions.\n\nAcuity projections in many cases are based upon specific data from the state and the RAC suaries. For instance, a number of our states shared files with us for those they expect to re-determine in April , May, and or June , and we are using this information to calculate the acuity of stares versus levers.\n\nOn the other side of acuity, the rate change projections are state by state, subpopulation by subpopulation, and they are often based upon direct conversations with the Medicaid departments and their actuaries, including many verbal acknowledgements of the potential need for rate actions as redeterminations unfold. We've had very constructive discussions with our state partners about redetermination.\n\nconfidence in our estimates of the net impact on 2023 and 2024 with the benefit of the clarity gained. One more relevant fact, for 2022, we were approximately $2 billion in payback payable back to certain states for risk corridors or minimum NBR profit sharing mechanisms.\n\nThat's important to factor in relative to any expected acuity shifts in those specific states. Finally, with each state putting a stake in the ground with respect to timing and approach, we are better able to refine our forecasted premium revenue for both 2023 and 2024.\n\nUltimately, we expect the rates provided by our states to match the acuity of the population as has historically been the case, though this is expected to ebb and flow through the re-determination process.\n\nIn other words, if there's a mismatch between acuity and rates, we expected to be temporary. Now let's get to some numbers. To provide some of our assumptions embedded in our updated 2024 target, we expect approximately 77 billion of Medicaid premium revenue in 2024 relative to approximately 84 billion in 2023.\n\nThe premium revenue drop in 2024 is largely driven by redeterminations continuing and annualizing into 2024. There are also some other puts and takes in the revenue including market share shifts as we have previously discussed the California contract renewal and the projected potential county shifts in Texas STAR+, as well as the added North Carolina expansion population. With respect to the Medicaid HBR as you will recall we were originally expecting to be\n\nput us at approximately 90.3%. Then we expect approximately 20 basis points of benefit from the new PBM contract and other initiatives to yield an estimated 2024 Medicaid HBR of approximately 90.1%.\n\nIn Medicare and Marketplace, we are still refining our bids that are due this summer. So we're going to be a little guarded with getting too granular with bid assumptions for each of those lines of business.\n\nIn Marketplace, our first quarter results were on track, and while one quarter doesn't make the year, we are so far pleased with the Marketplace positioning, not just for 2023, but also the longer-term benefit from strengthening our number one market position. We look forward to getting more insight into 2023 Marketplace performance as the year unfolds, including when we get the first\n\nWe keep on looking for signs of acuity increase and arent finding any you know looking at the first few months after initial cancer diagnosis or the cost per cancer diagnosis. Those are all in check so pretty stable I mean, there's always watch items specialty pharmacy, obviously, there's always a watch item.\n\nSo you're assuming some of the low acuity falls off on the Medicaid I'm wondering if you're assuming any of that.\n\nRisk profile evolves in the marketplace as a whole in 'twenty four and then based on some of the recent implementation changes by the state.\n\nThat's P to increasingly favor keeping people insured in some form.\n\nYeah, So really pleased with the growth in the overall market and as we've looked at data historically as the market grows the risk pool improves as well I think the.\n\nInto 2023 those are the stairs are equaling the lever. So we're cautiously optimistic on that business and the risk pool for 2023.\n\nAnd as Sarah mentioned, we did layer in a couple of hundred thousand of a redetermination members coming into the marketplace later in the year and so you know the member months arent that significant of a driver and we've factored in some variance around that into our revenue guidance already.\n\nGreat. Thanks, I wanted to understand that the long term EPS guidance, a little bit because it's it was just a little bit confusing to me because you're you're taking down. This year's sorry say next year's EPS number is still talking about 12% to 15%, but I think Sarah you said that your view about the earnings power Hasnt changed does that mean that you think.\n\nWhatever that is 635 kind of real earnings space that you have to then overcome to grow 12 to 15 off of $6 60. So I'm just trying to reconcile how you were thinking about long term earnings power in particular to the PDR and how that affects growth into 'twenty 'twenty five.\n\nThen I'll, let Sarah sort of weigh in on the 12% to 15% yeah. So thanks for the question and totally appreciate it you know when when we think about the long term and I'll roll back to you know even the beginning of the value creation plan. We had a lot of confidence that there was more earnings power in this organization than we were.\n\nMake some of these short term both explicit and implicit investments in our business in order to make sure that we are set up with the most strength against that long term algorithm and as drew said, we we see the $6 60 sensor greater than 660 floor as the right jump off point for that.\n\nThe 15% adjusted EPS in the long term.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nHey, good morning, two quick questions. The first is I appreciate your commentary about receiving data state files from the.\n\nFrom the states to update your margin assumptions around Medicaid. So the question is is that is there.\n\nThat largely complete have you received updated stay or leave or files from.\n\nAll your states or is it really more from the states that are there.\n\nImminently, beginning redetermination and we should maybe expect more material.\n\nTeach in that state information to come over the course of the year. The second is just on the IV in our days and dollars down a bit sequentially I know there's some other.\n\nItems in that line just wondering if there's anything else through the callout impacting that line on the balance sheet.\n\nYeah, Let me I'll hit the state filed conversation and turn it over to drew.\n\nSo we have as I mentioned, we when all but five of our states. We either have received files or are we have a process in place and the files that we've gotten have certainly been tilted towards the states that are already underway with their processor, where their start dates are more eminent.\n\nAnd and that's actually rolls back to the conversation that we've had over the last year and a half in this forum about how we were preparing for this process and the idea that as we got data our ability to drop that into our model and then extrapolate from that where they were common themes and whether we were seeing in those files.\n\nSir and lever analysis that was sort of in line with the macro analysis, we did without the benefit of them. The actual files and so getting those files is obviously helpful. In order to give us a view of those specific states, but we've also been seeing trends in those files again largely in line with our expectations.\n\nBut that has allowed us to update our extrapolation in the larger model. So that's a long winded way of saying that we feel like the data that we've received so far is is what has allowed us to update our view and conservatism in 'twenty for them. But then we also think that it has given us a pretty solid view of.\n\n24, and what will come in from other states now obviously, we need to see some of that but there's been enough consistency to give us the confidence to share what we did today and then I'll turn it over John I mean are you on the balance sheet.\n\nThe liabilities are up a fair amount from year end 12 31 22.\n\nThe accounts payable and accrued expenses are up but that's a billion three of state pass through so our pass throughs. The pure pass throughs actually don't go through medical claims liability. They go through premium revenue and Oh, sorry premium tax revenue and premium tax expense sort of outside the IV in our.\n\nProcess. So they don't really impact D. C. P. Now there are state directed payments embedded within medical claims liability and we define those terms in our press release and we've have had for a while but you know I'd be on our $17 5 billion or medical claims liability up from 16.7, you saw the D. C. P. You know relatively flat.\n\nSo feel good about the consistency of our reserving process.\n\nThank you and our next question today comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah.\n\n55% decline in 'twenty 'twenty four I think I think you've kind of sketch out how much of that is due to the conservatism and redetermination could you talk a little bit about how much is from the targeted investments and MAA.\n\nFrom a bids and then in your bid strategy, there and how much is investments in English infrastructure and up the investments in infrastructure could you talk a little more about the components of that and how much of that is necessary for the Medicaid business and the core businesses as contrasted with Medicare advantage.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lance Great question I was hoping you would ask that let me talk through sort of the core buckets of investment and then I'll hand, it over to drew to delineate the bridge a little bit more precisely so as we've gone through the transformation work the value creation work, particularly of platform consolidation work that we launched.\n\nLast quarter, and then obviously the sort of updated analysis of product strategy, we see an opportunity in three main buckets for investments and it's important to note and I'll call out where some of them are specific to Medicare and other product lines. As you asked but it's important to note that part of the reasons, we're making choosing to make.\n\nThese investments now is because they will accrue to multiple lines of business. So these are really enterprise wide synergistic investments. The first is under the umbrella of customer experience and so this is where in Medicare thinking about own distribution channels, which actually can accrue them over the long term, we believe to our marketplace business.\n\nSo as well really a business, it's becoming a sold business rather than one that is you know just purchased and influence through brokers in a different way provider enablement tools, which again will help with V. B C expansion in Medicare, but also work will support the V. B C expansion work that we're doing in Medicaid.\n\nAnd then the self service tools, which we see an opportunity across lines of business to enhance our digital interaction with our members. The second major bucket is quality and again. This is one where starz is a piece of this but the underlying components are really around heaters and health equity which are major.\n\nof the quality programs for all three lines of business. So he does is it is going to become an increasingly important part of stars based on the new CMS guidance as are the health equity investments. He this is a huge part of proving the quality outcomes to our state partners for Medicaid and it will put US ahead of the curve for what we see coming in marketplace from acute.\n\nS standpoint, and then the last piece is.\n\nInfrastructure and so a piece of that is really and that's fortifying those targets as soon as soon as we had been thinking about the platform consolidation what are those platforms that are going to be any targets and carry the scale of the organization in the back half of the decade, and making sure that we fortify those for scale and then of course my favorite topic.\n\nWhich is data and really accelerating the work that we're doing around data liquidity across the organization, our agility and ability to invest and use that data to power the business, but also to drive innovation. So those are sort of the three major investment buckets and again some of those accrue to the Medicare business, but.\n\nThey all accrue to multiple business lines, and then I'll turn it over due to give you. The bridge yeah on the numbers, we've talked about the $200 million P. D. R. I know that hits 2023, so it's not part of the 55 cents, but you really need to think about that as a conscious investment we don't take lightly spending shareholder money, but we think it's the right investments.\n\nTargeting the right members thinking about the long term.\n\nAttractiveness of the Medicare market, especially in the populations that we will emphasize going forward and then getting to the 55 cents, which is in 2024, 60% of that is the 30 basis points in Medicaid and the remaining.\n\n40% about $150 million plus or minus is the investments that Sarah just covered.\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Karl was hurt.\n\nJ P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nThanks, just a couple of clarifications.\n\nI know youre being conservative on the Starz assumption for next year. If you do get minimal improvement for 25 is the expectation that that comes back to you in 'twenty six such that you kind of keep it at 2020 'twenty ramp that you've talked about over the next three years.\n\nAnd then on Medicaid I know you've mentioned, having more member months, a year and a little more visibility into the timing of when members could roll off I was wondering if there's anything you're anticipating in terms of H B R, earning seasonality.\n\nThanks.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ken Let me hit the Starz question. So if we as I said, we are sort of assuming a downside scenario out of conservatism, partly because caps tends to be the longest pole in the 10 to recover and start and so if we see minimal improvement year over year. The important thing to look at will be the progression into three.\n\nAnd a half stars of our membership because again, that's as drew talked about where we get the economic benefit and the ability to continue to invest as we move through the progression and we again will look at the three and a half star threshold and movement of membership across that threshold as the definition of success as we move through the next cut.\n\nof years, but the 'twenty 'twenty 'twenty is not really a relevant guideposts anymore because of those changes I described in the bid strategy, which is intentionally going to make the mix more complicated and shift the denominator and the fact that the CMS program rules really suggests a different more methodical approach contract.\n\nBy contract to the levers that we use to get to a four star and then I'll turn it over to Jay for the second part, yeah, earning seasonality, where we expect to be pushing about 65% of our adjusted.\n\nAdjusted EPS for 2023.\n\nIn the first half of the year, So maybe 35 or slightly under 35 for the back half of the year that back half does include the fourth quarter assumption around the P. D. R. I think you were also referring to H B R seasonality in Medicaid think of it as like a checkmark. So we expect to be down a little bit in Q2 relative to the 90.\n\nOh, and then rising in the back half of the year.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time, we have for questions today, So I'd like to turn the conference back over to Linda for closing remarks.\n\nThank you I just wanted to close out by reiterating a drews comments and my own that we don't take the change in the 'twenty 'twenty four lately, but it's not something that we would be doing if we didn't firmly believed that it was the right thing for centene in the long term. So I appreciate the great questions. I appreciate everyone joining us today and look forward to updating.\n\nAnd you as we continue to execute in 2023 and build momentum for 2024 and the long term. Thanks, so much.\n\nThank you Ma'am. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which can also be accessed through our website at centene.com. Ken Fasola, Centene's President; and Jim Murray, our Chief Operating Officer, will also be available as participants during Q&A.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2022; and other public SEC filings.\nCentene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.\nThe call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2022 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section. The company is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain 2023 and 2024 measures to the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nCEO & Director, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and provide our updated outlook for 2023. First, let's close out the year.\n2022 was a dynamic and productive year for Centene. We took on many challenges, including a leadership transition, transforming our organizational structure, modernizing our approach to corporate governance, focusing on our core business, improving operations and quality and delivering on our financial commitments along the way.\nThis morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.86 and full year 2022 adjusted EPS of $5.78. These strong results came in above the top end of our most recently issued 2022 guidance and were 7% higher than the midpoint of our initial outlook for the year. Looking back over 2022, our 3 core business lines performed well.\nIn Marketplace, we materially improved the profitability of our Ambetter product line through advancements in our clinical programs and strategic product positioning, delivering more than the 500 basis points in margin improvement we promised while continuing to show solid growth and market expansion. This provided Ambetter with a strong jumping off point to achieve our long-term target margin and profitable growth goals in 2023.\nIn our Medicare Advantage business, Centene generated outsized growth in 2022, ending the year with 21% more members compared to year-end 2021. Our focus throughout the year was on strong clinical program performance, quality improvement, which you've heard a lot about; expanded value-based care relationships; and providing enrollees with a more seamless member experience.\nIn 2022, the strength of WellCare's underlying performance was demonstrated through year-over-year HBR improvement. And we're confident in our increasingly disciplined approach to quality operations will provide an important lever as we move through 2023 and work to improve WellCare's profitability on its expanded scale.\nOur local markets also performed well throughout the year, serving more Medicaid members in more geographies than ever before. Our Delaware go-live, as well as a significant number of successful reprocurements and program expansions, including in Louisiana, Nebraska, Texas and Missouri, to name just a few, bolstered our market presence and leadership position in Medicaid managed care.\nIn California, Centene was ultimately selected to serve the state through direct contracts in 10 key markets, including Los Angeles and Sacramento Counties. We are working towards readiness for the 1/1/24 start date of the new California contracts, and we look forward to our continued partnership with the state to improve the medical health care delivery system and advance the state's innovative [Calian] programming.\n2022 also marked the first full year of execution on our value-creation plan, and it was by every measure of success. We hit all major milestones, including redesigning our UM function across the enterprise; successfully negotiating a new PBM partnership, reducing our real estate footprint by 70% to accommodate new workforce flexibility, itself an important cultural evolution for the company; and making important investments in data and digital tools that will make it easier for our members, our providers and our employees to work with us.\nWe exit 2022 not only well positioned to achieve our $400 million in targeted SG&A savings in 2023, but also having added $300 million in new SG&A opportunities to our longer-term backlog. In addition to achieving these value-creation milestones, we made meaningful progress on our portfolio review process.\nWe closed 3 divestitures in 2022 and announced a fourth. Notably, in the first weeks of 2023, we closed the previously announced sale of Magellan Specialty as well as the sales of Centurion and HealthSmart, bringing our total number of divestitures since Q4 of 2021 to 7. This disciplined execution has streamlined our enterprise, reduced distraction and allowed us to increase our focus on our core business lines. It has also powered significant and timely share repurchases during 2022 and year-to-date in 2023.\nFinally, in December, we aligned the enterprise around a long-term strategic plan, inclusive of a commitment to 12% to 15% long-term adjusted EPS growth. With our senior leadership team in place and the company's demonstrated progress against our strategic and financial goals in 2022, we are well positioned to capitalize on the momentum of the past year and successfully continue our value-creation journey for shareholders and members in 2023. With that, let's talk about 2023 so far.\nCentene's Marketplace products yielded exceptional growth during this year's open enrollment, outpacing even the robust growth of the total market itself. This year's OEP performance only reinforces our view of the increasing durability of the Marketplace as a coverage vehicle and Ambetter's leadership position within this market.\nTo harness this growth opportunity, our Ambetter team applied a portfolio approach to pricing and product positioning, decisively leveraging our local expertise and strong broker relationships on a market-by-market basis to attract and retain membership across our Marketplace footprint. While it is still early days with respect to claims experience, we want to share a few observations about Ambetter's strong OEP growth and provide some performance expectations given the team's outperformance on membership.\nApproximately 70% of our 2023 membership is enrolled in a Silver Plan compared to approximately 72% in 2022. Silver plans have consistently represented the majority of our membership year after year, and 2023 is no different. Similar to previous plan years, the majority of our 2023 membership selected our core product. At the same time, we are pleased with the continued uptake we are seeing in our newer products, demonstrating the value of flexibility and plan design for our members.\nKey membership demographics like gender, age, geography and subsidy levels are consistent with what we experienced last year. Most importantly, these factors are also consistent with the pricing assumptions we used for 2023 product positioning. We continue to expect our Marketplace business to achieve margins within the long-term targeted range of 5% to 7.5% during 2023. And we are pleased to have the opportunity to serve so many Marketplace members as the reach of that product continues to expand.\nAs we highlighted for investors last month, Medicare Advantage enrollment results for 2023 developed softer than expectations we provided at Investor Day in December. Our goal for the 2023 AEP was to foundationally align our Medicare offerings for long-term margin recovery, product stability and overall quality, capitalizing on the scale we achieved through outsized growth in 2021 and 2022.\nIn our effort to better control the overall member experience, which requires operational stability and contributes directly to quality results, we made the decision to change our distribution strategy and focus more on proprietary channels.\nNear-term sales and retention were more significantly impacted by our distribution strategy than expected, particularly in light of competitor investment in channels we deprioritized. That said, several of the channels we prioritize performed better than expected, reinforcing our long-term view of an optimal go-to-market strategy for Medicare Advantage and dual eligible members.\nDespite the soft membership results relative to expectations, we continue to expect 100 basis points of Medicare HBR improvement in 2023. Importantly, we are already seeing positive operational impact for members and brokers, with strong service levels, improved customer satisfaction and a 30% reduction in overall calls compared to this time last year.\nTurning to more recent Medicare news. Regarding the finalization of the RADV rule, we are supportive of CMS' decision to limit the scope of historical audits. CMS' decision in this regard avoids significant cost and abrasion for our provider partners. That said, the lack of fee-for-service adjustment and the as-yet undefined sampling and extrapolation methodology leaves a number of open questions as to the viability of the final approach. We are working in collaboration with our industry partners to determine the best path forward.\nRegarding last week's preliminary rate notice, 2024 initial rates are less favorable than recent years and below our internal expectation for funding. We will fully exercise our ability to provide feedback to CMS during the comment period and look forward to collaborating with the agency as we work towards rate finalization in April. That said, we see a path to achieving Medicare Advantage results that meet member needs and support our 2024 financial goals.\nFinally, as we all know, 2023 will be an important year for the Medicaid business. In December, Congress passed the Federal Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, which ends a continuous coverage provision on March 31. This tees up redeterminations to begin this spring, an event we have been working to prepare for throughout 2022.\nAs we approach the redetermination process, we are focused on 3 things: first, optimizing the verification process for members. We are working closely with our state partners and our network of community partners in each market to facilitate member transition and coverage continuity. In the last month, we've deployed internal and external training designed to maximize each member touch point and our ability to support beneficiaries as their eligibility is reviewed.\nLeveraging Centene's unique and powerful data, we've launched eligibility likelihood modeling across our Medicaid footprint in order to prioritize and customize member outreach. And we've launched enhanced reporting and membership dashboards for clear tracking of redeterminations-related activities across the enterprise.\nSecond, we are focused on ensuring that state program rates reflect any shifting of the risk pool created by membership changes. We recognize the dynamics in each market are different, so we are leveraging our data to support early collaborative discussions with our state partners.\nAnd third, we are focused on maximizing the opportunity to provide coverage continuity to members who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but who are eligible for subsidized coverage on the Marketplace. Given the strong overlap of our Medicaid and Marketplace footprint in 25 states, we continue to size the opportunity for our Marketplace products at 200,000 to 300,000 lives throughout the duration of redeterminations.\nIn 15 of the 25 states, where we have both Medicaid and Marketplace products, we will reach out to our current members directly with educational information regarding the enrollment process as well as with Marketplace plan options. We expect that state count to grow as we advance through the redeterminations process, and we have a robust, scalable plan in place to support this communication and education effort.\nFinally, I'd like to highlight some important news that came just a few weeks ago. In late January, the FCC issued guidance to improve member communication opportunities related to maintaining Medicaid and other governmental health care coverage. We view this as an incredibly important step, not only relative to supporting a seamless verification process, but also a meaningful step forward in modernizing the industry's overall approach to Medicaid member engagement. We are working closely with states to integrate this guidance into our redetermination strategy and to prove the value of digital engagement in reducing cost and improving member outcomes.\nOn balance, when you take into account our more informed view of open enrollment for 2023, the updated timing of redeterminations and recently closed divestitures, we are well positioned to achieve the top half of our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. Drew will provide greater detail on our outlook in just a moment.\nAs we look ahead, 2023 promises to be another transformative year for the enterprise and one in which we will need to navigate notable market dynamics across our product lines from redeterminations to Medicare positioning to fast-growing Marketplace products. This is not new for Centene, and we are better equipped to manage through this change than we ever have been before, thanks to the work we have done over the last 18 months to focus and fortify our operations and to align the organization around value-creation principles.\nAs we look downfield, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for all 3 of our core businesses, including complex Medicaid populations and dual eligibles, Marketplace adjacencies and STAR score improvement. We continue to track well against our long-term goals and look forward to executing against our strategic plan, driving strong results and delivering value to members and shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Drew to review our results and outlook in more detail.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Sarah. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2022 results, including $35.6 billion in total revenue, an increase of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.86 in the quarter. For the full year, we reported $5.78 of adjusted EPS, a 7% beat over our original 2022 guidance and growth of over 12% compared to 2021.\nLet's start with revenue details for the quarter. Total revenue grew by $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by strong organic growth throughout the year in Medicaid, primarily due to the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations; strong Medicare membership growth; and the January 2022 acquisition of Magellan, partially offset by divestitures.\nOur Q4 consolidated HBR was 88.7%, a little bit better than our expectations, and 87.7% for the full year. Medicaid at 89.6% for the full year was right in line with our expectation of an HBR in the 89s for 2022. Medicare at 86.2% for the full year was 90 basis points better than 2021, driven by execution of clinical initiatives.\nAnd on commercial, recall, we originally promised a 500 basis point reduction in the HBR in 2022. How did we do? We were down 550 basis points for the full year. This was driven by disciplined pricing actions, initiatives executed in 2022, and as expected, a reduction in COVID and pent-up demand costs compared to 2021.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 8.7% last year, driven by the inclusion of Magellan and the sale of PANTHER as well as increased Medicare marketing and value-creation investment spending in the quarter, given the overall company outperformance.\nCash flow used in operations was minus $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. You may recall, in the third quarter, we had an early receipt of $2.9 billion of CMS payments pertaining to the fourth quarter, which is driving down our reported Q4 operating cash flow. Cash flow provided by operations was $6.3 billion for the full year, representing 5.2x net earnings or 1.9x adjusted net earnings. This was driven by earnings before charges, including real estate and divestiture-related impairments and an increase in medical claims liabilities.\nOur domestic unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand was $793 million at year-end, though after making some planned pass-through payments in early January, that amount is closer to 0.\nFrom January of 2022 through today, we repurchased 39.1 million shares of our common stock for $3.3 billion. Debt at quarter end was $18 billion, down approximately $800 million from prior year-end, driven by senior note repurchases of $318 million, a repayment of our $180 million construction loan and repayments of over $100 million in revolver and term loan borrowings. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA came in right at 3.0x, down from 3.5x a year ago. Days in claims payable was 54 in Q4 of 2022 compared to 54 in Q3 of 2022 and 52 in Q4 of 2021.\nGAAP earnings during the quarter include impairments related to several divestitures that were completed or pending as of December 31, as well as an impairment of our federal services business, partially offset by a gain on the sale of MagellanRx.\nLooking back at 2022, it was a very good year of execution during some notable changes for Centene. Sarah hit on some of the highlights, but let me remind you of a few. We beat original adjusted EPS guidance by 7%. We bought back almost 7% of the company's shares, including January 2023 repurchases. We reduced debt-to-adjusted EBITDA to 3x and got upgraded to investment grade by Fitch. We continue to execute on divestitures. Since Q4 of 2021, we've completed 7 divestitures for gross proceeds of over $3.5 billion. We improved the discipline of the company in many areas while strengthening DCP by a couple of days, and we picked up 2 very strong operators, Fasola and Murray, along the way.\nAll right, enough on the rearview mirror. Let's talk about what really matters today and tomorrow, starting with 2023. We gave detailed guidance elements at Investor Day, but a few things have happened since then, including more clarity of the timing of the restart of redeterminations, a couple more Centene divestitures, a very strong Marketplace annual enrollment period and softer Medicare Advantage enrollment as we mentioned at the recent investor conference in San Francisco.\nMy bias when we haven't yet closed the first month of 2023 is not to touch 2023 guidance until we have some actual results, but there are a few things that will help you understand how we are starting out of the gates compared to what we outlined at December Investor Day. Our 2023 premium and service revenue should be approximately $2 billion higher than the range provided at Investor Day.\nLet me bridge that for you: $1.5 billion more of Medicaid premium revenue from a higher starting point in 2023 and an additional 2 months until redeterminations recommence April 1; plus an additional $3 billion of commercial premium revenue from an outstanding marketplace open enrollment period; minus $0.5 billion of Medicare revenue as we were off in the annual enrollment period, down high single digits versus down mid-single digits; and minus approximately $2 billion of divested revenue previously in guidance, Magellan Specialty, Centurion and HealthSmart.\nLet me go a little deeper on 2 2023 topics. On the additional Medicaid broad growth of $1.5 billion, we expect to give about 2/3 of that back in the redetermination process. So our previous estimate of $8 billion of ultimate run rate revenue give back goes up to $9 billion. By April 1, we expect to have grown by 3.4 million Medicaid members since the onset of the pandemic, excluding new markets and we expect to lose approximately 2.2 million of those members in the redetermination process over the next 1.5 years. In other words, about 65% of that growth.\nThe 2023 portion is baked into the new revenue guidance. The remaining 2024 portion would be about $6 billion of the $9 billion. And I know a number of you have asked about our early read of attributes related to our growth in Marketplace. As Sarah outlined, based upon a review of the demographics, metal tiers, product types, subsidy eligibility and distribution sources of our new membership, we don't see any signs of alarm. The proof will ultimately being the claims data, but all of this Marketplace growth, even membership from carriers who have exited, comes in at our product design, our network construct, our pricing and into our clinical models.\nWhile we aren't changing our adjusted EPS guidance range at this very early stage for 2023, all of this recent insight, including the higher revenue base, biases us to the top half of our adjusted EPS range of $6.25 to $6.40. And of course, once we see from data -- once we see some data from Q1, we will refine all the underlying elements for you no later than our Q1 earnings call, suffice to say that we ended 2022 strong, and that looks to be continuing into 2023.\nAs we look out to 2024, we remain committed to our previously provided adjusted EPS floor of at least $7.15. While we're 10 months away from giving formal 2024 guidance, let me give you some updated color on recent events that are included in this assessment.\nFirst of all, on the positive side, 2023 looks to be a little stronger out of the gate as we just discussed. Second, we completed California renegotiations in late January and are pleased with the outcome. Third, our Marketplace business is $3 billion larger than we had previously assumed, and we expect performance in the target margin zone in both 2023 and 2024. Four, investment income continues to grow, including the recent 25 basis point Fed rate increase in early February. Five, share count is down further, and with the stock price lower, we will strive to accelerate planned share repurchases earlier in the year. That's a pretty good collection of tailwinds.\nOn the headwind side, though, Medicare is going to be challenging for us in 2024. We knew it was going to be tough given the cards we were dealt in STAR scores, stemming from poor decisions in 2020. And the impact of a disappointing advanced notice on 2024 rates does not help. We will most certainly be pricing for a negative margin in Medicare Advantage in 2024 temporarily. And we don't expect to grow Medicare Advantage in 2024 and likely will shrink a little.\nWe have a lot of work between now and the first Monday in June when the bids are due to refine our estimates and products further. And obviously, the industry will be asking a lot of questions about the components of the advanced notice in anticipation of final rates in a couple of months.\nBut here is the silver lining. If we can achieve at least $7.15 of adjusted EPS in 2024, with a meaningfully underperforming Medicare business embedded in that result, that becomes a margin expansion and growth opportunity in the back half of the decade as we improve STARS and pull other levers over the next few years. We know what needs to be done. It just takes time, especially in STARS.\nWe can now turn the page from a very good 2022, the first year of execution from this management team and an important foundational year for multiyear improvement as we look ahead and ultimately getting to our long-term growth and earnings algorithm we shared with you at Investor Day.\nThanks for being part of our journey. Operator, Rocco, you may now open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings results conference call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; Brent Layton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed February 22, 2022, and other public SEC filings.\nCentene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2022 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section.\nCompany is unable to provide a reconciliation of its 2023 and 2024 adjusted diluted EPS targets to corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range.\nFinally, please mark your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day on December 16 in New York City. Invitations and necessary registration information will be sent out shortly.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nCEO & Director, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning as we discuss our third quarter results.\nDuring our time today, I'll review the highlights of our financial and operational performance for Q3 and address some of the more recent developments shaping our view of 2023 and beyond. Then Brent will offer comments around the core businesses and share updates on our strong positioning relative to 2023 Medicare and Marketplace enrollment. Finally, Drew will provide details of our overall financial performance and update our full year 2022 outlook.\nFirst, the quarter. We reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.30, slightly ahead of our expectations. Our strong results were driven by continued organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare, the continued impact of Marketplace bid discipline, as well as strategic capital deployment in the form of share and bond repurchases.\nWe now expect Centene's full year 2022 adjusted EPS to be within a range of $5.65 to $5.75, as we've raised the bottom end of the guidance range by $0.05 to reflect strong third quarter results and taking into account continued investments to yield future returns.\nSince our initial issuance of the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance, we have now raised the midpoint 5.5% or $0.30, driven by government program growth and the successful execution of several key value creation initiatives. Drew will cover the quarter and our financial outlook in more detail shortly.\nOur strong year-to-date performance provides positive momentum as we prepare the organization for 2023 and beyond. With successful Medicaid reprocurements in Mississippi, Nebraska and Texas this quarter, our business development team continues to execute well, demonstrating their powerful market knowledge and delivering solid results. While we were disappointed with the results in the California RFP process, we remain confident in the quality of our RFP response, and in the merits of our protest there, which we'll talk more about shortly.\nIn our other core business lines, we are enthusiastic about the opportunities we see to strategically balance growth with margin expansion. In Marketplace, we have demonstrated strong margin improvement this year and see the recent developments in the marketplace competitive landscape as an opportunity for new organic growth in 2023 and beyond.\nIn Medicare, we are confident we have positioned our bids to achieve expanded margin performance next year, while still delivering low to mid-single-digit growth. Together, Medicare and Marketplace are well positioned to offer tailwinds in support of our 2023 earnings goals.\nBehind the scenes, our transformation work continues with a number of value creation initiatives achieving key milestones during the quarter. As you know, we are redesigning key shared service functions to reflect the size and scale of the organization, and we're supporting these teams with modern, flexible technology that will streamline workflows and make it easier to serve both members and providers.\nThis quarter, we completed the first wave of call center regionalization and successfully installed new call center technology to support the Marketplace team in the upcoming open enrollment period.\nWe also launched our Provider 360 application that will allow us to more seamlessly manage our provider relationships across the country. Each of these enhancements position Centene for improvement in both quality and efficiency as we move into 2023.\nAt the same time, we continue to advance our portfolio review work. We closed PANTHER (sic) [PANTHERx] this quarter and are in the closing process on both MagellanRx and Ribera. We will share additional updates as we position our non-health plan assets for maximum strategic value.\nFinally and importantly, we are pleased to share that a major cornerstone of our Value Creation Plan was achieved this month when we concluded our PBM RFP process ahead of schedule. As many of you know, we expected the RFP process to drive significant value for Centene, our members and our state and federal partners.\nBeginning January 1, 2024, Evernorth Express Scripts will provide Centene's pharmacy benefit management services. This new partnership will allow us to innovate and redesign the way our pharmacy benefits are administered, as we deliver improved value to our customers and shareholders. As a result of this new contract, we anticipate delivering savings that exceed our previous expectations in 2024 and throughout the duration of the multiyear agreement.\nNow turning to 2 recent challenges. Given the development around both STARS and our California contract, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing additional perspective on each of these issues.\nAs we've shared before, the year-over-year deterioration of our Medicare Advantage Star Ratings was driven in part by the sunsetting of disaster relief provisions related to COVID. We were additionally impacted by a decline in specific metrics related to ops and admin, a result of our own operational challenges during late 2020 and 2021.\nWhile the final results were slightly worse than our internal expectations, the vast majority of the revenue headwind was known to us months in advance, as we shared transparently with the investment community. This knowledge allowed us to position 2023 products with an emphasis on benefit stability and create a glide path to better mitigate the member impact from the STARS revenue headwind in 2024.\nAs we called out during our June Investor Day, since learning of the magnitude of the STARS impact, we've taken aggressive action to change our approach to the STARS program. From an organizational perspective, we hired an experienced Chief Quality Officer and assigned strong operational leaders to manage key ops and admin programs beginning in Q1.\nWe centralized oversight of the quality program and moved the entire organization under Jim Murray, our Chief Transformation Officer, to directly connect quality to our value creation office and take advantage of Jim's long experience driving Medicare quality outcomes.\nIn addition, we launched a focused effort to standardize and streamline our quality processes, and we implemented real-time operational dashboards to track key performance metrics.\nEarlier this year, we invested in new technology to enhance our access to clinical data around gaps in care, and we committed to integrating the company's numerous quality platforms into a single unified workflow.\nFinally, we made significant investments to improve our Medicare members onboarding journey, including the redesign of our approach to those mission-critical survey questions that impact caps and other metrics.\nBut addressing the STARS challenge didn't stop with operational transformations. In late Q1, this newly installed management team cracked open our 2022 performance plan, and added quality improvement as a key compensation metric for every single employee at Centene across the enterprise.\nWhen I say quality is a priority, I mean it. Over the next 3 cycles, our goal is to achieve at least 60% of members in 4-star plans. And I promise you, this senior management team is aggressively tracking STARS improvement towards that goal on a real-time basis.\nNow turning to California. The California RFP also carries implications for earnings power in 2024. Shortly after the August Medical award announcement and after closely reviewing the results, Centene, along with many other RFP participants filed protests with the State of California.\nAs this audience will appreciate, we are limited in our ability to comment too much during an active protest, but I will say this, Centene takes a matter of filing protests seriously. When we do so, it is not a matter of reflex, but done only when we see serious errors in a decision-making process, resulting in negative impacts on our beneficiaries.\nBecause of our historic discipline around these decisions, Centene has a proven track record of success in the protests we have undertaken. And given our strong view of the merits of our California protest, we intend to exhaust all available avenues of appeal.\nDrew will talk more specifically about the financial impact of the STARS issue and the California results in a moment, but it is important to note that we are actively managing both situations and feel confident in our current strategies.\nAs a reminder, Centene is on a journey of transformation in service of value creation. Between now and 2024, our work is to focus and fortify the organization, creating a strong foundation from which to drive profitable growth over the long-term.\nFrom the time our value creation plans were initially late in June of 2021, this team went in eyes wide open to the level of change we were determined to enact. As we reflect on 2022, and the 2 full quarters since this management team has taken the helm, I am pleased with the amount of progress we have made and confident in our delivery of future milestones.\nWe've assembled the right talent with proven executive leadership skills, created a sharpened focus through our value creation office and made deliberate investments to accelerate change. There is a lot more work ahead, but delivering this year's foundational milestones creates important momentum that will carry us into 2023 and 2024.\nThe upcoming December Investor Day presents us with an important opportunity to give investors clarity around the long-term strategy that will underpin the trajectory of Centene's business. We'll use Investor Day as a platform to share important areas of operational focus, as well as to lay out the market opportunities upon which we'll build our future growth. And importantly, we'll commit to long-term growth targets, so that our investors are clear on management's expectations for our enterprise.\nBefore I turn it over to Brent, I'd like to take a brief moment to express my gratitude to our Centene team members in Florida for their efforts in the face of the destruction brought by Hurricane Ian last month. Once again, our local teams activated quickly, harnessing the power of our local partnerships to support our members and employees and their communities in a time of need.\nSunshine employees contacted more than 22,000 high-risk members ahead of the storm to ensure they had a plan, and in the storm's wake to confirm their safety and assess their needs. We partnered with state and local government entities to strategically deploy resources, provide community support and offer distribution and staging sites for relief efforts.\nMore than 500 Sunshine Health employees, some of whom were impacted themselves. Nonetheless, volunteered their time at disaster relief sites, including those sites we set up inside our health plan community centers.\nAt the height of operations, our community center in Fort Myers was serving more than 2,100 families each day, providing needed items like food, water, diapers, baby formula and basic hygiene products. Mission-driven employees are Centene's most powerful asset. Thank you to Sunshine Health employees and employees nationwide for your steadfast support of the communities impacted by Hurricane Ian.\nThroughout 2022 from Buffalo to (inaudible) to Fort Myers, your acts of selflessness and service demonstrate the extraordinary impact of our mission-driven workforce. I cannot express to you how proud I am to call you colleagues and friends.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brent for an update on the business.\n\nBrent Davis Layton\n\nPresident & COO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Sarah, and good morning. We are pleased to have made so much progress in 2022, both organizationally and operationally. While some of the benefits will take time to materialize externally, the internal advancements are tangible.\nDuring the third quarter, we received results from several RFPs. In August, we received mixed results in California, as we were awarded contracts in 9 counties, including San Diego. We have also been awarded a sole-source contract in Imperial County. As Sarah mentioned, we have appealed the state's notice of awards and we'll provide updates on the process as appropriate.\nin August, we were also informed of our successful bid to continue to serve the State of Mississippi's Medicaid managed care program, including entry into the CHIP program. We've been a part of the Medicaid program since its exception and are pleased to continue our relationship with the state.\nIn another of our long-standing markets, we reprocured the STAR Health Medicaid program in Texas. We've held this contract since 2008 when in collaboration with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Department of Family and Protective Services. Our health plan, Superior became the first managed care organization in the country to provide statewide sole source Medicaid coverage to children in foster care.\nTo round out the quarter, we were fortunate to win the reprocurement of our statewide managed care contract in Nebraska. We look forward to continuing to serve our membership in the Heritage Health program.\nIn our existing Medicaid business, membership has increased to 15.7 million members at the end of third quarter, and we continue to see an uptick in RFP activity. As the PHE has been extended to February, our Medicaid growth continues to be aided by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations.\nAs you've heard me say before, whenever the PHE comes to close, we'll continue to work with our state partners to support member transition and believe we are well positioned to attract membership to our Marketplace products.\nOur Ambetter product ended the quarter with 2.1 million members and remains on track to meet its margin goal for 2022. As the marketplace leader, we continue to ensure that Americans have financially affordable options for coverage, especially there in times of disruption, such as the recent announcement of market exits by some of our competitors.\nWe are working closely with our state partners to ensure these members have access to affordable coverage. We also see the extension of the enhanced advance premium tax credits as fuel for additional growth during 2023 open enrollment period, which will begin in a few days.\nConsistent with our strategy, Ambetter Health will continue to pursue margin expansion through strategic membership growth and thoughtful pricing discipline.\nAs we look to 2023, we've expanded our Marketplace offerings to the State of Alabama, bringing this to 28 states. Additionally, we've added more than 60 new counties, bringing us to over 1,500, which is over half the counties in the United States.\nWe're also looking forward to the expansion of our Ambetter Health Virtual Access product, which we first launched during 2022 open enrollment. This product supports affordable and convenient access to licensed virtual primary care providers, as well as access to specialists and other support services.\nWe will offer Virtual Access in 9 new states for the upcoming open enrollment period, bringing the product to 13 states in total. Our geographic and product expansion, sales strategy, stable pricing, product offerings and operational strengths allow us to be optimistic about our positioning for 2023 open enrollment.\nIn Medicare, we ended the quarter with over 1.5 million members. We have strong geographic growth for 2023 with WellCare product offerings of about 80% of the eligible Medicare population. We feel our 2023 products are in line with the expectations to support our low to mid-single-digit growth expectations and continue to focus on member retention.\nLook forward to telling you more about our '23 outlook in December. In short, our core products continue to perform well.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Brent. Today, we reported third quarter 2022 results of $35.9 billion in total revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2021, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.30. Based upon performance in the quarter, we're raising our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $5.65 to $5.75 by lifting the bottom of the range $0.05.\nYear-to-date, our guidance midpoint is up $0.30 or 5.5% since our original 2022 guidance provided in December of 2021. Total revenue grew by $3.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by: one, strong organic growth throughout the last year in Medicaid, primarily due to the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and Missouri Foster Care that commenced [71, 22%].\nNumber two, the January 2022 acquisition of Magellan and 3 strong Medicare membership growth. This was partially offset by the July 2022 PANTHERx divestiture. Our Q3 consolidated HBR was 88.3%, Medicaid at 90.2% was right on track in the quarter, consistent with normal seasonality and back-to-school encounters. 48% of our Medicaid members are under 18 years old.\nMedicare at 83.9% was better than expectations in the quarter, driven by favorable health care affordability initiatives consistent with our efforts to improve execution.\nYear-to-date, the Medicare HBR is trending better than our original expectation, which we assumed would be roughly flat to 2021. That should bode well for our baseline as we look ahead to 2023 and 2024.\nThe commercial HBR of 84.2% improved 450 basis points quarter over prior year quarter, consistent with our original full year goal of an approximate 500 basis point HBR improvement in 2022 compared to 2021.\nCommercial performance in 2022 has been driven by disciplined pricing actions initiatives executed in 2022, and as expected, a reduction in COVID and pent-up demand costs compared to 2021.\nOur Marketplace businesses in 2022 is a good example of execution of margin expansion balanced with growth, which will enable us to take advantage of membership opportunities in 2023 and beyond.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.3% in the third quarter compared to 8.1% last year. The inclusion of Magellan and the sale of PANTHERx increased the ratio by approximately 20 basis points compared to the year ago quarter.\nAdditionally, we increased Medicare marketing and value creation investment spending in the quarter. This was partially offset by real estate optimization savings based upon efforts that we began in Q2.\nSince the start of the third quarter, we have repurchased 15.3 million shares of our common stock for $1.3 billion. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 19.5 million shares for $1.7 billion. Also, since the start of the third quarter, we have repurchased approximately 317 million of our senior notes for $300 million to balance the capital structure and take advantage of market conditions.\nWe are working to close the MagellanRx divestiture by the end of the year. Estimated net deployable proceeds on that transaction would be in the zone of $1.1 billion. A few weeks ago, we were very pleased to receive an upgrade for our senior notes to investment grade by Fitch. The company has been working on that goal for a couple of years. Our senior notes are now rated investment grade by 2 of the 3 major rating agencies.\nCash flow provided by operations was $3.3 billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by earnings and the receipt of approximately $2.9 billion in CMS payments for October on the last day of September. This temporarily drives up unearned revenue and accounts payable on our balance sheet.\nOur year-to-date operating cash flow was $7.8 billion or $4.9 billion, excluding the early receipt of payments from CMS, representing 3.5x net earnings or 1.7x adjusted net earnings.\nOur domestic unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at quarter end was $387 million, a portion of which was spent in October to finish up the capital deployment I just referenced.\nDebt at quarter end was $18 billion. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA came in at 3.0x. Our medical claims liability totaled $16 billion at quarter end, and represents 54 days in claims payable compared to 55 days in Q2 2022 and 51 days in Q3 of 2021. The sequential decrease was largely driven by the timing of pharmacy claims payments.\nOutside of adjusted earnings during the quarter, we recorded a $0.65 gain on the sale of PANTHERx, partially offset by a $0.23 loss on the impairment of Ribera Salud, and a $0.16 real estate impairment, consistent with what we discussed last quarter.\nWe expect another $0.15 or so of real estate impairment outside of adjusted earnings over the next couple of quarters as we complete the value creation real estate optimization. These items are reflected in updated GAAP guidance.\nQuickly on 2022 adjusted earnings guidance, since we only have 1 quarter left in the year. As mentioned, we are lifting the bottom of the adjusted EPS range by nickel. Underneath that, premium and service revenue is up approximately $700 million. There is no change to HBR from the previous range.\nIn the back half of 2022 investment income outperformance has largely been offset by SG&A investments to yield future returns. Suffice to say 2022 has been a very good year on of executing on the Value Creation Plan as a new leadership team.\nMany of you have asked about 2023 and 2024 in the context of recent business developments like the California RFP, Florida Medicaid rates and STARS, so let me give you some more color.\nWe are in the middle of building up our detailed 2023 annual operating plan that we will complete by the beginning of December, seek our Board approval, and then share formal 2023 guidance with you at our December 16 Investor Day. Based upon good execution on our value creation plan and anticipated 2023 tailwinds and headwinds, we are still targeting low-6s consistent with what we have relayed to you previously.\nWhile we so-called blessed consensus last December when it was at $6.20, today's consensus would still be in an expected 2023 guidance range. And that includes the worse-than-expected 4% to 4.5% rate decrease effective 10/01/22. We will run through all of the tailwinds and headwinds at the Investor Day and provide you bridges such that you can have confidence in our 2023 gain plan.\nAs we look ahead to 2024, we know a fair amount more than we first -- when we first laid out a long-term target at our June 2021 Investor Day. Let me provide more insight into a few of the components that are different than our original construction of 2024, starting with STARS.\nIn 2021, we knew we would have a step back in STARS revenue for 2024, due to not only the inevitable sunsetting of COVID disaster relief provisions, but also underperformance in the area of Medicare ops and admin in the back half of 2020 and in the first half of 2021 prior to this management team taking the helm.\nSarah provided you color on more of the background. But yes, it was a little worse than we originally expected as the final STAR results became visible during 2022.\nMoving now to California. Our 2024 forecast construction anticipated and continues to anticipate retaining our major state Medicaid contracts, including California. We are confident in the basis for our protest, but if we are unsuccessful, that could be a pressure point relative to the $7.50-plus target.\nOn the positive side, we are very pleased with the economics to be realized as a result of the PBM RFP process. Investment income is stronger today and expected to be stronger in 2024 than we originally had built into the 2024 modeling. And we are pulling Value Creation Plan levers and buying shares with 2024 in mind.\nA number of you have asked for the impact of STARS in California. But let me boil it down into a macro view of 2024, including the items, I just mentioned. There is approximately $0.20 to -- $0.25 to $0.50 of potential EPS pressure in 2024 in relation to our original goal of $7.50-plus.\nUntil we know more on the outcome of California, we are still committed to driving to at least $7.50. I hope that gives you adequate scenario-based color for 2024, as we sit here in 2022.\nAnd I'm sure you've thought through if we can achieve our 2024 goals. That means we have pulled levers that both annualize and carry into 2025 when our STARS headwind turns into a sequential tailwind.\nWe are pleased with the third quarter and the progress demonstrated in 2022 as well as the prospect for our business in 2023 and beyond. And we look forward to sharing with you our long-term strategy and long-term growth algorithm for both revenue and earnings growth at Investor Day in December. Thank you for being part of our journey.\nOperator, you may now open the lineup for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jen Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings results conference Call. Sarah London, Chief Executive Officer; Brent Layton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com.\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2022, and other public SEC filings. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change.\nWhile the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of these measures can be found in our second quarter 2022 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section. Please mark your calendars for our next earnings conference call scheduled for October 25. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Sarah London. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nCEO & Director, Centene Corporation\n\nThanks, Jen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Centene entered 2022 with a focus on value creation. As a reminder, value creation at Centene means becoming a better partner by simplifying and strengthening our operations. making it easier for our members and providers to work with us.\nIt means focusing on our core business and leveraging trusted local relationships to fuel disciplined growth and it means allocating capital to innovation that delivers better outcomes. Value creation is not measured solely in earnings per share, but importantly, in the impact that we have on the members we serve and the communities we support.\nOver the last 6 months, our value creation program has gained momentum and scale with efforts that span our local health plans and enterprise-wide functions. At the same time, the team is executing well on our day-to-day objectives and doubling down on our work to define the long-term trajectory of the organization for 2025 and beyond with a focus on sustainable growth and market leadership.\nThis morning, I'll provide headlines of our quarterly performance and cover a few more recent value creation updates. Before handing the call over to Brent for an update on product line performance, I'd also like to touch briefly on what I've observed over my first few months as CEO about Centene's ability to differentiate in the marketplace.\nLet's start with the quarter. Second quarter results were directly in line with the guidance we provided at our June Investor Day. Thoughtful product positioning across lines of business, initiatives to enhance medical management and a more balanced approach to capital allocation, all contributed to our strong first half performance, which provides an excellent foundation to build from as we look to the balance of the year.\nToday, we once again increased guidance with our full year adjusted EPS outlook now at $5.60 to $5.75, which represents a cumulative $0.20 increase since Q1.\nYou will hear more details about the quarter and this improved full year outlook from Drew shortly. On the value creation front, we are full steam ahead. You've now heard quite a bit about the Myriad in-flight initiatives Jim Murray and his team are tracking and supporting in close partnership with our business leaders.\nWe continue to see solid progress on our operating model redesign efforts as well as our work to optimize key process-driven functions like quality and utilization management. Our plan to establish a pharmacy center of excellence across the health plans continues to advance and the PBM RFP process remains on track.\nIn the handful of weeks since our June Investor Day, we completed the Panther divestiture, closing out another key milestone in our portfolio review work. As previously announced, a majority of the net proceeds from the sale will be used to repurchase stock and the balance to reduce debt.\nYesterday, we announced another important portfolio action with the signing of a definitive agreement to divest our Spanish and Central European assets to Vivalto Santé,which is the third largest private hospital company in France. We believe the Vivalto Santé is well positioned to invest in and grow Ribera Salud, Torrejón and Pro Diagnostics group, while ensuring they continue to provide high-quality care for patients across Europe.\nAcross the remainder of our non-health plan portfolio, the review process remains very active, and the team is leveraging our evolving long-term strategic framework to ensure that we position these assets either through investment, partnership or divestiture to deliver maximum strategic benefit moving forward.\nConsistent with our capital deployment plans, it is worth highlighting that we repurchased $450 million of our common stock since the beginning of Q2 and in part leveraging proceeds from other minor asset sales in the quarter. On the real estate front, we previously described the comprehensive exercise to evaluate our leased and owned real estate portfolio.\nToday, we took an important step towards the achievement of run rate savings related to that exercise, recognizing a charge reflecting a material reduction in the company's real estate footprint. This allows us to capture savings associated with the space rationalization beginning in Q3. We continue to expect approximately $200 million of run rate savings for 2023 and beyond.\nThis initiative reflects the high value we place on evolving Centene to meet the needs of our incredible workforce, but it should also serve as a proof point that we will look to pull forward the benefits of our work wherever possible as we progress on this value creation journey.\nAs you can see, value creation work streams are delivering tangible progress and measurable results. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to provide updates on major operational milestones in keeping with our commitment to transparency and to prove that we are building the momentum necessary to carry us through the rest of this year and help us deliver meaningful financial results in 2023 and 2024.\nCentene's ability to grow, deliver and transform all at the same time is made possible by our most valuable asset, our 80,000 diverse and innovative employees. Their mission-driven dedication to our members powers everything we do in this organization. I've spent quite a bit of time on the actual and virtual road since taking on this new role, meeting with our health plan leaders renewing connections with our key state partners and listening to team members at the front lines of our market operations.\nAnd I want to report back to you that my conviction regarding the power of Centene's local approach has never been greater. Local matters when it comes to growth as our unparalleled business development team improved yet again with the recent win in the state of Delaware.\nYears of boots on the ground, personal visits, relationship building and deep market knowledge were key to securing a contract award in Centene's 30th Medicaid State. Local makes the difference when it comes to outsized impact, as I saw on my visit to our Silver Summit Health Plan in Nevada.\nThere, team members realized how many of our new mothers didn't have access to transportation and so they partner with an organization called Baby's Bounty to create a diaper van that could deliver baby essentials, diapers and wipes directly to Southern Nevada's tiniest and most vulnerable residents.\nLocal also makes a difference when it comes to innovation as I experienced firsthand on a recent trip to New Hampshire. Combating the effect of rapidly rising food prices and knowing the risk food and security presents to our Medicaid members, our team at New Hampshire Healthy Families jump started their green to go program, distributing locally sourced fruits and vegetables from food vans strategically positioned across the Granite State.\nSo let me tell you where local really makes a difference. Local makes a difference when it comes to caring, the kind of deep personal caring that comes when your customer is also your neighbor. On May 14, when shots rang out in the aisles of a neighborhood grocery store in Downtown Buffalo, our extraordinary colleagues at Fidelis Care in New York State sprang into action. No one from headquarters had to call them and tell them what to do.\nThey knew what to do because they were there inside the community because they were local. Within 24 hours, Fidelis employees mobilized to distribute food and needed supplies into a community whose only grocery store was surrounded in police tape. And with the neighborhood pharmacy inside that top grocery store suddenly closed, our locally based team identified and called every one of the 373 members who had filled their prescriptions at that pharmacy in recent months.\nWithin 72 hours, each of those 373 members received a personal call from a Fidelis Care employee checking in on them. Assuring their supply of medication was in order and assisting them in identifying additional pharmacy resources in the area. Neighbors engaging in simple but profound acts of human caring. That's the power of local.\nWe are proud of the progress and the financial performance of Centene year-to-date, and we are proud of the work that our team members do every day. Value creation for members leads to value creation for shareholders, and we will continue to focus on this alignment in the coming months and years as we execute on both value creation and our long-term strategic plan for 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call to Brent for more detail on our core business line performance during the quarter. Brent?\n\nBrent Davis Layton\n\nPresident & COO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Sarah, and good morning. I'm happy to talk about the performance of our core business lines during the second quarter. Centene is the leader in Medicaid Managed Care, and I'm pleased to say we continue to grow.\nEarlier this month, we were honored to be notified by the state of Delaware of an intent to award Centene contract to serve a Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program. Beginning January 1, 2023, Centene's health plan, Delaware First Health, will provide integrated services for physical and behavioral health and long-term services and supports through the Diamond State Health Plan and Diamond State Health Plan Plus programs.\nThis is Centene's 30th Medicaid state. It's quite an achievement, and we look forward to this tremendous opportunity in Delaware. In addition to our new estate, earlier in the quarter, we were successful in the reprocurement of our Missouri contract serving TANF, CHIP and Expansion membership. We were also awarded the sole source specialty plant for children and foster care in Missouri. These contracts began July 1, and we're serving nearly 50,000 foster children and children receive an adoption subsea assistance in the state.\nThis is our industry-leading fifth sole source and specialty contract serving children and young adults involved with the Child Welfare System. We are incredibly proud of our innovative programs and outcomes for this membership. In our existing Medicaid membership has increased to 15.4 million members at the end of the second quarter.\nMedicaid growth continues to be aided by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations. As you're all aware, that PHE is now extended to at least mid-October. As states consider their programs and budgetary needs post redetermination, several states beginning to process to transition new populations into managed care.\nThe state of Indiana has recently released an RFP for long-term services and supports, and we have recently responded to an RFI in Georgia, where the Medicaid agencies asking MCOs about their ability to serve more medically complex populations. Whenever the PHE comes to a close, we'll continue to work with our state partners to support member transition.\nWe remain confident in our ability to attract eligible membership to our marketplace products in 25 states where we have both Medicaid and Exchange Membership. Speaking of our exchange product, we entered the quarter at over 2 million members. Halfway through 2022, we remain the leader in the marketplace product.\nThe quality and consistency of our product offerings and operations has led to continued membership growth and the ability to partner closely with our providers. We continue to monitor the situation in Washington, in regards to enhance advanced premium tax credits and remain cautiously optimistic on the movements of this reconciliation bill.\nWe feel confident in our submitted bids for 2023, and we look forward to targeted geographic expansion and thoughtful expansion of new products that we began to offer in 2022 open enrollment. In Medicare, we ended the quarter at nearly 1.5 million members and are pleased with our continued membership growth of over 18% year-to-date.\nUtilization continues to be steady, and we're seeing the benefit of our focused clinical initiatives. As we look towards annual enrollment, we are concentrated on margin and network expansion and the further penetration of existing states and markets. We continue to see Dulles as an area of growth for our company as our core capabilities position us well to serve this complex population.\nMidway through 2022, our core products continue to perform well. With that, let me turn the call over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Brent. This morning, we reported second quarter 2022 results of $35.9 billion in total revenue, an increase of 16% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and 11% was organic with 5% from M&A.\nWe reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.77 in the quarter, up 42% from $1.25 in Q2 of 2021. Overall, I'd characterize this as a strong quarter consistent with the update we provided to you at Investor Day on June 17. Let's start with revenue for the quarter.\nTotal revenue grew by $4.9 billion compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by strong organic growth throughout the last year in Medicaid, primarily due to the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations, strong Medicare membership growth during the annual enrollment period, the acquisitions of Magellan and Circle and the commencement of contracts in North Carolina.\nTotal membership increased to 26.4 million, up 7% compared to a year ago. Our Q2 consolidated HBR was 86.7%, and Medicaid at 89.1% was a little better than expectations. Medicare at 85.6% was right on track and our commercial business continued to make progress toward our margin goals aided by the results of risk adjustment, which in Marketplace is zero-sum across the industry and tends to settle out pretty quickly in the following year.\nGiven the risk adjustment headwind we experienced in Q2 of 2021, we expected a big year-over-year improvement in HBR, and we got more than we expected. The commercial HBR of 77.5% improved 1,250 basis points year-over-year, also driven by pricing actions and a return to more normalized utilization compared to the second quarter of 2021.\nWhen we look at our consolidated data, our Q2 COVID costs were down about 2/3 from Q1, which included the Omicron variant. Utilization has largely returned to a more normalized cadence as we have encouraged and facilitated our members to access health care, including preventative care.\nFurthermore, throughout 2022, providers seem to be more resilient to managing COVID and non-COVID simultaneously. There's still a few areas that appear to be suppressed compared to 2019 and such as non-emergent ER visits, we believe Telehealth and improved primary care connectivity have played a role here.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.2% in the second quarter compared to 7.3% last year. On a combined basis, the inclusion of Magellan and Circle increased the ratio by approximately 40 basis points compared to the year ago quarter. Additionally, we incurred increased risk adjustment and member engagement costs that accompany the commercial HBR outperformance, higher Medicare broker commissions as we continue to grow and increased variable compensation.\nWe expect our value creation plan to drive SG&A lower over the next few years, though there will be ROI-based investments along the way. On the topic of the value creation plan, during the second quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.45 billion related to the reduction in the company's real estate footprint consisting of $744 million related to leased real estate and $706 million related to owned real estate assets.\nThis was the lion's share of the charge we discussed at Investor Day in June with approximately $200 million more expected to come over the next couple of quarters related to real estate optimization. Cash flow provided by operations was very strong at $3.4 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by earnings before the real estate charge and a reduction in receivables partially due to the receipt of state directed payments.\nOur domestic unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at quarter end was $483 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased $344 million of our common stock through our share repurchase program. As a result of the value creation plan year-to-date, we have repurchased $450 million including $106 million executed in July.\nFurthermore, on July 14, we completed the divestiture of Panther and expect to recognize an after-tax gain of approximately $400 million in Q3. The majority of the net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion will be used to repurchase stock and reduce debt as mentioned earlier by Sarah.\nWe are working to close the Magellan Rx transaction by the end of the year. Estimated net deployable proceeds on that transaction would be in the zone of $1.1 billion. And we were pleased to announce the sale of a few of our international businesses yesterday. Debt at quarter end was relatively flat at $18.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 41.3%, temporarily pushed up from the real estate charge.\nWe continue to target a high 30s debt-to-capitalization ratio longer term. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA came in at 3.1x pretty close to the milestone we are seeking of 3x or less. Our medical claims liability totaled $16.6 billion at quarter end and represents 55 days in claims payable compared to 53 in Q1 of 2022 and 48 in Q2 of 2021.\nThe sequential increase was largely driven by the timing of pharmacy payments and state-directed payments received but not yet paid. As a reminder, on June 17, we lifted our adjusted EPS range by $0.15 to a range of $5.55 to $5.70 million Today, we're adding another $0.05 to guide to a range of $5.60 to $5.75, largely driven by some of the real estate benefit to be realized in the back half of the year net of some investment spending, such as the Delaware win.\nIn aggregate, since issuing initial 2022 guidance in December, we have increased our full year adjusted EPS outlook by $0.28 or 5% at the midpoint. GAAP EPS guidance has been adjusted to reflect the real estate charge and the gain on the sale of Panther. We've also updated the components of guidance, and I know some of you have models to build, so let me touch on some of the other P&L metrics.\nFull year premium and service revenue is down $1 billion in cost of services is down approximately 100 basis points due to the divestiture of Panther. We also adjusted our share count and expect interest expense around $660 million, factoring in the deployment of Panther proceeds. We have ticked down HBR by 10 basis points to reflect performance in Q2 and have lifted adjusted SG&A by 20 basis points.\nApproximately 1/3 of that lift is due to Panther, which had a high cost of services ratio but a very low SG&A rate. The remainder reflects the SG&A items I mentioned earlier, slightly offset by the $0.05 net SG&A benefit and guidance. For the full year, we would expect investment in other income in the zone of $400 million excluding the Panther gain and depreciation in the low to mid-600s, and we still assume a November 1 commencement of redeterminations and guidance.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the tangible results we are showing today, both in terms of performance and value creation. But to be balanced, there are areas that we still need meaningful improvement such as Medicare Stars. Though we have referenced this multiple times, we want to make sure we are explicitly transparent.\nThe Star scores that come out in the fall of 2022, and called rating year 2023 Star scores that drive 2024 Medicare revenue are going to be disappointing and unacceptable to this management team. At Investor Day, June -- Investor Day in June, Sarah touched on the why. We've been rebuilding governance fortifying operational areas and making the appropriate investments in people, process and technology over the past 9 months, and that will continue.\nExecution in 2022 will drive Star scores to be released in the fall of 2023, which drive 2025 revenue, and we expect will create a meaningful rebound from the rating year 2023 Star scores. The senior management team and value creation plan are all over this. While we've made great progress in the first half of this year, this company has plenty of opportunity to improve which will create long-term value for our members, providers, state and federal customers and shareholders.\nThat's what we're excited about. Our journey is on track, and thank you for being part of it. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

London\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter 2022 results. I want to begin by acknowledging the passing of a great man, Michael Neidorff, whose leadership and passion built Centene into the purpose-driven market leader that it is today. Michael infused our entire organization with the belief that high-quality affordable health care should be within reach of every American, especially our nation's most vulnerable.\nOn behalf of the entire Centene team, I want to send our thoughts and prayers to Michael's family. We will miss him dearly, but I can assure you that Michael's legacy lives on in the men and women of this company, and our commitment to his vision has never been stronger.\nOn our call today, I'll begin with an update regarding the company's leadership structure, touch on first quarter highlights and then provide you an update on strategy and our value creation initiatives. Brent will speak to our performance in our core business lines. And finally, Drew will review our financial results and full year 2022 outlook in more detail.\nFirst, the company's core leadership structure. We are updating this morning the construct of the office of the CEO. This group of individuals represents the most experienced, strategic and senior leaders of the organization, who will assist me in setting policy and driving forward Centene's enterprise agenda. The office of the CEO includes myself, Brent Layton, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Drew Asher, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Murray, our Chief Transformation Officer, who will take on expanded responsibilities in addition to our value creation office; and Ken Fasola, who, in addition to leading Magellan, will assume oversight of our portfolio of strategic non-health plan assets.\nThis construct with key support from our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, formalizes the manner in which we've been operating for the last several months and represents the agenda setting nucleus of the organization as we enter the next stage of transformation and growth.\nNow let's discuss our first quarter results. Centene delivered a strong first quarter performance, including adjusted diluted EPS of $1.83 up 12% compared to the year ago quarter. We closed the quarter with 26.2 million members, up 8% compared to the year ago quarter, demonstrating the strength and value of our products in the market and the success of our enrollment periods. As a result, we are raising our full year 2022 outlook from our previously provided range. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted EPS to be within a range of $5.40 to $5.55. Drew will provide more details on the quarter and outlook in a few moments.\nNow to strategy. Over the last few months, the opportunities to optimize and strengthen our business have become even clearer. We remain hyper focused on executing our Value Creation Plan with many work streams well underway and clear milestones ahead. At the same time, we are refreshing our long-term strategy in order to pave the way for growth beyond our 2024 horizon. As we have said before, focusing on our core business and prioritizing value creation are not just short-term ideas. They are pillars of, and critical inputs to, a long-term strategic vision for the company.\nLet me give you an example. Over the last 9 months, you have heard us repeatedly talk about operating excellence as a focus of our value creation work. It includes streamlining platforms, standardizing processes, modernizing systems and using data everywhere to be as smart as possible about how we do our work. It means fewer calls, fewer clicks and faster answers. Will it create SG&A savings? Absolutely. Is that our measure of success? No.\nThe real goal of operating excellence is to fundamentally improve the experience that members, providers, community and state partners have with Centene. Success, put simply, is making it easier to do business with us. For our members, we believe we can deliver more seamless and efficient ways to give the information, access and care they need when and where they need it most.\nOur goal is to increasingly empower our members and their caregivers as agents and advocates in the care journey. For our provider partners, we believe there is a significant opportunity to align more closely in value-based partnerships, and we are committed to delivering the data and tools that will help them drive better health outcomes.\nFor our state partners, we believe in being excellent at the basics, but we also intend to leverage our uniquely local approach to deliver innovative solutions that are infused with an understanding of the communities we serve and designed to help them succeed. The goal across all stakeholders is the same: to build lasting trusted relationships. This has been a differentiator for Centene from the beginning, and we intend to build on this strength as we grow and innovate. More to come on this during our June Investor Day. In the meantime, you should feel confident the work we do over the next 3 years will not only align with but naturally fuel our next phase of innovation and growth, and we are designing and executing with that end in mind.\nNow turning to specific updates on the value creation work. We remain on track to achieve our previously stated goals. Jim Murray and his team are moving at a rapid but thoughtful pace to execute on these initiatives with tremendous support and partnership from both our corporate business leaders and our local team leaders. While we are excited about our progress, we also ask you to recognize that some of these initiatives are complex and will take years to fully complete.\nWe are being deliberate using a step-by-step approach to ensure that standardization and operational enhancements are taking place in the right way across the organization. This means that as we enhance certain enterprise-wide best practices, we will also preserve the local feel and approach that has served as this company's hallmark for 2 decades.\nI'll give you a few examples of the progress the team has achieved in the quarter. First, we successfully hit our pharmacy platform migration milestones and are already engaged in strategic discussions with our potential PBM partners about how to drive additional quality and value in delivering pharmacy benefits to our members. Last week, slightly ahead of schedule, we released the RFP that will cover our more than $40 billion of pharmacy spend in 2022.\nWe have made meaningful progress this quarter in evaluating our existing portfolio of real estate assets, given our commitment to increased work from home and flexible work models. We are in the process of determining the necessary square footage to support our employees moving forward and anticipate a significant downsizing of our current leased space.\nWe have also advanced our efforts to centralize key functions such as utilization management and call centers to enterprise shared services organizations. To that end, we performed a lift and shift of reporting responsibilities for both these functions earlier this month. For the remainder of the year, we will be focusing on standardizing best practices and optimizing these operating models. In addition to the savings opportunity, we believe these organizational shifts will create a better experience for our members and providers as well as our employees.\nLastly and importantly, we've kicked off our efforts around large-scale IT platform consolidation. As you know, Centene has grown tremendously through acquisition over the last several years. And as we have mentioned before, the resulting technology footprint includes multiple core platforms and over 500 support applications. The conversion process will require a multiyear staged approach to derisk the effort, but the opportunity for increased efficiencies is significant. And while this will be hard work, consolidation is necessary to enable the stakeholder experience we intend to deliver. These are just a few examples of the nearly 15 work streams in the process of being activated. As I stated earlier, we are very pleased by our progress but recognize that we still have miles to go before we sleep.\nBefore I wrap up, I would like to highlight a recent example of the work we are doing to improve health equity through data-driven innovation. In March, Centene was 1 of 3 organizations who received the Innovation Award by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, for our focus on health equity. The award recognizes Centene's data-driven health equity improvement model for being a leading-edge strategy for improving health equity and health care quality. The effectiveness of our health equity improvement model represents success on many levels.\nBy using a data-driven process, we are identifying opportunities to reduce health care disparities, designing initiatives across community member and provider levels and tracking our impact. These efforts can produce higher quality outcomes for our members and, in turn, improvement to important metrics such as HEDIS scores.\nTo highlight some examples, Centene's health equity model was able to improve rates of immunizations for Latino children with our SilverSummit Healthplan in Nevada, colorectal cancer screening rates for American Indian and Alaska native members in our Arizona complete health plan and maternal health outcomes among African-American and Black members with our Health Net plan in California.\nHealth Net has also been chosen to participate in NCQA's Health Equity Accreditation plus pilot program. Addressing health equity in new and innovative ways is very much aligned with our purpose and will be an important part of our work going forward. Further, applying big data to drive local outcomes will be a critical and sustaining differentiating strategy for the enterprise.\nIn closing, I'm humbled by the opportunity to lead this exceptional team and company. We have significant runway ahead to deliver for our members, enhance our operations, achieve our financial commitments and create value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Brent, who will provide an update on our core business lines. Brent?\n\nBrent Davis Layton\n\nPresident & COO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Before I jump in, I'd like to build on Sarah's remarks. I had the pleasure of working with Michael Neidorff for 21 years. His impact on this company is undeniable, and I will continue to be thankful for the opportunity he gave me. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize this is Sarah's first earnings call as our CEO. And Sarah, I couldn't be more pleased to continue to work with you in your new role. And I think I speak for the entire team here at Centene when I say we're excited about what the future holds for us as an organization under your leadership.\nNow back to the business of the day. I'm happy to talk about the performance of our core business lines during the first quarter. In the first quarter, we have seen HBR in line with expectations across each of our core products. Our Medicaid business remains strong, with membership increasing to nearly 15.3 million members at the end of the first quarter and contract reprocurement wins in Louisiana and Indiana. As I'm sure you've all gotten -- got used to me saying, our Medicaid growth continues to be aided by the ongoing suspension of redeterminations.\nAs Drew will explain further, we anticipate the return of redeterminations in August. We continue to work with our state partners to better understand how we can support this transition and are confident in our ability to retain and attract membership to our exchange products in the 25 states where we have both Medicaid and Marketplace.\nAs states begin to transition back to redeterminations, I believe we will begin to see new opportunities for Medicaid managed care programs as we move past the pandemic, and states look to improve health outcomes and make Medicaid programs more efficient.\nIn our exchange product, following a strong open enrollment, we ended the quarter at over 2 million members. We are pleased with both our member retention and our new member enrollments. As I discussed at the fourth quarter call, we introduced 3 new product offerings for the exchange in 2022. These products designed to meet the evolving needs of our members, have performed in line with our expectations, serving as both the tool for our member retention and attraction as a means to provide member engagement and manage utilization. While we're pleased with the performance of these products, our core and better product offerings remain the foundation of our exchange offerings.\nWe continue to monitor the administration's adjustment to the exchange market, including efforts to close the family glitch, which could allow an additional 5 million people to use tax credits to purchase Marketplace plans. In Medicare, we ended the quarter following annual enrollment with more than 1.4 million members across 36 states. Overall, we are very pleased with our strong growth of Medicare, yielding 200,000 net new members and 16% membership growth year-over-year 2021. We've managed well through another COVID variant at the top of the year as well.\nAs we continue into 2022 and beyond, we see significant opportunity in Medicare. Our focus continue to be margin enhancement through clinical initiatives, network expansion and value-based contracting. Overall, 2022 is off to a solid start across all 3 core products.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Drew.\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Brent. This morning, we kicked off 2022 with first quarter results of $37.2 billion in revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.83 in the quarter up 12% from $1.63 in Q1 2021.\nLet's start with revenue for the quarter. Total revenue grew by $7.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to strong organic growth throughout the last year in Medicaid and strong Medicare membership growth during the annual enrollment period. Total membership increased to 26.2 million, up 8% compared to a year ago.\nIt's important to note a couple of revenue drivers that were unplanned in the quarter. First of all, you will see that our premium tax revenue was $3 billion in the quarter. That's about $1.5 billion more than we had estimated. This was largely due to 4 states providing lump sums for us to pass-through to providers. And remember, this revenue item is interesting but not relevant since it's 100% pass-through. That's why we are constantly orienting you to the premium and service revenue, which drives important metrics like net income margin and SG&A percentage.\nPremium and Service revenue of $34.2 billion in the quarter was about $1 billion higher than our expectation with approximately half of it due to a Texas retroactive hospital pass-through that CMS recently restored. Because there's a small administrative provision on this retro item, it's included in premium revenue, not premium tax revenue. The remainder of Premium and Service revenue outperformance was strong continued Medicare and Medicaid growth.\nOur Q1 consolidated HBR was 87.3% consistent with our expectation, leaning slightly positive. Since you now have visibility and comparability into quarterly HBR components, let's talk about each. Medicaid at 88.9% was right on track in the quarter. Our Medicare HBR was slightly better than our expectation driven by a good quarter for our Medicare PDP business. The PDP business may only be $2 billion in annual revenue, but it's a great asset. That's the largest contributor to our over $40 billion of 2022 pharmacy spend, and it's a good captive audience for our Medicare Advantage business.\nAll right, back to the Q1 HBR. Our commercial business improved 420 basis points year-over-year reflecting pricing discipline and making progress towards the annual goal we laid out at Investor Day.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 7.7% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations compared to 7.6% last year. The inclusion of Magellan and Circle each increased the year-over-year ratio by approximately 20 and 15 basis points, respectively. We expect our Value Creation Plan to drive SG&A lower over the next few years.\nCash flow provided by operations was $1.2 billion in the first quarter primarily driven by net earnings. Our domestic unregulated and unrestricted cash on hand at quarter end was $68 million as expected after closing the Magellan transaction in early Q1. Our goal continues to be to build cash at parent beginning in the back half of 2022 for share buybacks and debt paydown. This corresponds with the timing of the majority of our health plan dividends.\nDebt at quarter end was relatively flat at $18.9 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was down slightly at 40.7%, excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $16.3 billion at quarter end up $2 billion and represents 53 days in claims payable compared to 52 in Q4 2021.\nAs we begin 2022, we're building momentum both in our businesses and our Value Creation Plan. And as you've heard me say many times, one quarter doesn't make the year. However, we do have a quarter of actuals under our belt, and we all know that the PHE has been pushed out to July and therefore, redeterminations would start after that. So let's go through some changes we made in full year 2022 guidance metrics.\nPremium and Service revenue was up $2.5 billion, including the first quarter results, the Texas item we discussed earlier and an assumption that redeterminations commence August 1, 3 months later than our prior assumption. Since we continue to grow due to the pushback of the PHE end date, we also expect the ultimate run rate revenue reduction to be higher at around $6 billion, up from our previous estimate of $5 billion. That will largely impact 2023.\nContinuing on with 2022 guidance, premium tax revenue, once again, with no impact on bottom line, is up $1.5 billion for 2022. And our HBR and SG&A ranges are reconfirmed and unchanged. Overall, given the results in the quarter and pushing back the commencement of redeterminations, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.40 to $5.55 with a little over 60% in the first half of the year.\nAs we look ahead, I'm pleased with the value creation work so far. And as Sarah said, this goes well beyond cost-cutting. Jim Murray and the team are making operational decisions and changes that are focused on long-term durability of operating excellence.\nYou've heard this company talk for years about quality and STARS, and now better late than never, STARS is a tier 1 initiative of the value creation office with new investments being made in member engagement, value-based contracting, operational functions and clinical initiatives. Given the Star calendar, it will take a couple of years for our investments to show up in Star scores that come out in late 2023, which will drive 2025 revenue. In the meantime, as we said in multiple venues, the Star scores that come out in late 2022 that drive 2024 revenue will show a meaningful drop due to the sunsetting of the COVID era disaster relief provisions and our immature operations during these past measurement periods.\nOn other value creation initiatives, we look forward to giving you more details at the June Investor Day, but let me give you a teaser on one that Sarah mentioned. While we are still finalizing the details, we expect to reduce over half of our domestic leased real estate footprint. Though there will be a onetime cost to this, which we will frame for you in Q2, the run rate benefit will be a nice contributor to our value creation goals. More to come in June.\nIn summary, the business is performing well while we are focused on, enthusiastic about and investing in the future. Thanks for your support.\nOperator, you may now open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nJennifer Lynch Gilligan\n\nSVP of IR, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah London, Vice Chairman; Brent Layton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. .\nAny remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-Q filed on October 26, 2021, and other public SEC filings, including the risks and uncertainties described with respect to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business and results of operations. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.\nThe call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?\n\nMichael Frederic Neidorff\n\nChairman & CEO, Centene Corporation\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir.\n\nMichael Frederic Neidorff\n\nChairman & CEO, Centene Corporation\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nOperator\n\nLoud and clear, sir.\n\nMichael Frederic Neidorff\n\nChairman & CEO, Centene Corporation\n\nOkay. I'll start over. Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Sarah London, Brent Layton and Drew Asher. We had a strong ending through 2021. Our portfolio is performing well as we executed across our 3 major product lines during the fourth quarter, building on our strong foundation and extending our market-leading position in government-sponsored health care. Our membership grew 4% to 26.6 million individuals driven by increases in Medicaid, strong growth in Medicare and good performance in our Marketplace business. We also welcome the Magellan team to Centene earlier than last more with the acquisition successfully closing exactly 1 year after we announced the transaction. We are pleased to welcome the Magellan team led by Ken Fasola and Jim Murray.\nThere is a dire need for mental health care in this country. 2 years into it, this pandemic and the acquisition of Magellan will allow us to expand our reach to provide increased access to the haze. In addition, Magellan will give us the capabilities to innovate and reimagine behavioral health, significantly enhancing our ability to provide integrated physical and mental health care to all our members.\nAlso in January, we welcomed 5 new Board members to our Board as part of our port reflection process, who bring significant industry and various leadership experience. Bob Ditmore, John Roberts and Tommy Thompson have retired from the Board. And I want to thank them for their many years of service and contributions to Centene.\nAs I look back on the onset of the pandemic, I am pleased with how we navigated the uncertainty, served our members and we grow -- and grew the business, a diversified health care enterprise. Just this year, we have added $14 billion. We have accelerated our plans for our value creation and have a clear pathway ahead to expand our margins and deliver strong multiyear earnings growth. We have the right team and the right strategy with significant opportunities ahead. Finally, I want to thank all our employees who continue to step up and serve our members during the surge of the Omicron. I couldn't be prouder of a good role that we have played in ensuring that our -- stay strong and healthy with the highest quality care, particularly during the pandemic.\nAnd you probably hear, I have a little frog in my throat, so I'm going to turn this over to Sarah London, who will help manage us through the question-and-answer period and I'll participate as I want to. Sarah?\n\nSarah M. London\n\nPresident of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology & Vice Chairman, Centene Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As Michael noted, we delivered a strong fourth quarter performance creating positive momentum as we start the new year and successfully executed on key operational objectives, including the introduction of new Marketplace products for the 2022 open enrollment period, repositioning that business for success in a constantly evolving landscape, the delivery of another strong annual enrollment period in Medicare Advantage as the value we provide for beneficiaries continues to resonate in the market and continued progress on our value creation plan, including refining margin expansion opportunities and advancing the execution of our highest priority initiatives.\nOn today's call, Brent will comment on our core businesses. including how we are carrying our Q4 momentum forward into 2022. Then Drew will provide details on our fourth quarter performance and financial outlook.\nBefore I turn it over to them, let me provide a brief update on the value creation progress. From a structural perspective, we have added important talent and leadership to our value creation office. As we announced in early January, Jim Murray, who served as Magellan's President and COO, has transitioned to take on the new role of Chief Transformation Officer, leading the day-to-day management of the VCO. Jim brings experience in operating discipline and a track record for successful execution, adding another important layer of accountability to our value creation program. We are thrilled to have him on board.\nNow to the details. As we mentioned at our December Investor Day, 2022 is largely a year of foundational execution, and we plan to provide guideposts on our operational progress, incremental though some may seem, as a way of bringing you on the journey with us and offering a view into the work underway. And while we are only 1 month into Q1, we have already made progress on some of those key guideposts.\nFirst, our pharmacy platform consolidation project. As a reminder, the strategy here is to outsource administrative PBM functions to an external partner, thereby allowing us to reduce our 3 PBM platforms down to 1 and to focus that technology on the clinical member and provider engagement capabilities that are most important to differentiating the overall member experience. This will drive SG&A savings across the technology footprint and allow for more efficient investment in process automation.\nComing into 2022, we had 8 remaining state-specific programs that had not yet been consolidated on our external PBM platform. We successfully migrated 3 of these on January 1 and another on February 1 as planned. We are targeting the fourth migration for March 1 and the remaining 3 are scheduled for later in Q2. Overall, we are on track to be fully consolidated in time to issue our planned PBM RFP against our full $38 billion of pharmacy spend. I am pleased to say that work is well underway to prepare for the RFP release this summer, and we look forward to maximizing value for the enterprise through that process.\nSince December, we have also made good progress on the efforts we outlined around standardizing and rationalizing core operations. We initiated Phase 1 of our call center standardization, including process mapping as well as beginning the formal enterprise transition of our telephony infrastructure to the cloud. As we mentioned before, this will offer more convenient ways for our members to interact with us and get the information they need. We are starting with our Medicare and Marketplace products and expect this work to be completed in early Q3.\nWe also kicked off Phase 2 of our utilization management work, which involves building an enterprise shared services function to serve all 3 major product lines with a primary focus on enhancing quality and productivity. We completed the Medicare transition and now have the Marketplace transition in motion.\nLastly, back in October, we formally updated our work-at-home policies as we have learned how to deliver the same level of productivity and service to our members in a more flexible workplace environment. The shift to work at home and enhanced flexibility will have a meaningful impact on our ability to recruit and retain talent, but it also means we need to reevaluate our real estate footprint, something Drew mentioned during the December Investor Day. We have already evaluated approximately 25% of our facility locations and see opportunities for material downsizing of our footprint. Expect updates on that work as we get through the full real estate portfolio.\nFinally, I want to touch on the capital allocation pillar of our value creation plan and particularly the portfolio review process. Closing out the story on USMM, we used the proceeds from that majority divestiture to execute $200 million in share repurchases in December. We are aggressively working our way through the noncore portfolio with a consistent, rigorous and strategic evaluation process. We will continue to provide updates on this work as it progresses.\nWhile the value creation work is critically important, it is also complex. Let me assure you that we have full organizational commitment to our value creation objectives and are laser-focused on leveraging Centene's size and scale to unlock significant value for our stakeholders. But let me also take this opportunity to thank our leaders and our teams throughout the organization from our local market CEOs and operational leaders to frontline staff and clinical experts for their enthusiasm, agility and willingness to think differently and work differently in service of our members.\nOverall, our businesses are performing well. We are building on the strength of our core business lines, and we are making meaningful progress on our commitment to margin expansion, all while delivering for our members, state partners, employees and shareholders. I'd now like to turn the call over to Brent for some insights on our core business line performance during Q4.\n\nBrent Davis Layton\n\nPresident & COO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be here today to talk about our performance of our core business lines. Over the past 2 years, we've discussed how Centene's size and scale and our ability to be nimble has allowed us to manage through this pandemic. We remain well positioned to provide quality services in a pandemic environment or a return to more normalized utilization. Government-sponsored health care continues to grow in the U.S., and Centene continues to gain momentum across all of our product lines. Our Medicaid business is still growing with membership increasing to $15 million as we closed out 2021. This growth was aided by the ongoing suspension of redeterminations, which I will talk about more in a moment.\nWe continue to see success in our Medicaid business, such as our new contract in Nevada. In Medicare, we ended the year with more than 1.2 million members across 33 states. As we mentioned last month, we experienced strong growth during the open enrollment period and remain on track to meet our 2022 expectations. We benefited from the combination of WellCare's product expertise and Centene's strong provider network and geographic footprint. In 2022, Centene offers plans in 327 new counties as well as 3 new states. We continue to see significant opportunity within Medicare as our expanding footprint makes Centene's product offering available to more than 75% of the country's eligible beneficiaries.\nFinally, in Marketplace, membership was more than 2.1 million at the end of the year, and we are pleased with our open enrollment results. For 2022, we are excited about our product offerings, which have evolved to meet the demands of our members with greater flexibility, accessibility and affordability. At the same time, we're further expanding our reach, offering Marketplace product in 5 new states. This year, Ambetter is in 49% of all counties in the U.S. This product and geographic expansion translated to solid growth during the open enrollment period. And what makes the sustained momentum in Marketplace more impactful is the fact that we never participated in a race to the bottom with our rates. We remain committed to returning Ambetter margins back to their long-term pretax target of 5% to 7.5%. And I think the initiatives we undertook in Marketplace in 2021 and the pricing discipline showed clear evidence of our ability to execute on our margin goals across all of our business lines.\nBefore handing the call over to Drew, I want to provide a quick update on our thinking of redeterminations. We continue to work closely with our state partners to understand the timing and how to best support the transition. Our current outlook continues to reflect a return of redeterminations in May. But again, this will not be universal and the timing will vary state by state. The continuity of care by members that roll off Medicaid remains a top priority. Our breadth of products and services provide Centene a great opportunity to deliver this continuity of care at a low cost through our Marketplace capabilities. We currently offer exchange products in 25 of our 29 Medicaid states.\nOverall, we are pleased with our competitive position of our portfolio heading into 2022. With that, let me turn the call over to Drew. .\n\nAndrew Lynn Asher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Centene Corporation\n\nThank you, Brent. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2021 results, including $32.6 billion in revenue, an increase of 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.01 in the quarter and $5.15 for the full year. These results are at the top end of our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance provided at our December Investor Day. .\nLet's start with revenue for the quarter. Total revenue grew by $4.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to strong organic Medicaid and Medicare membership growth during 2021. Total membership increased to $26.6 million, up 4% compared to a year ago. Our Q4 consolidated HBR was 87.9%, consistent with our expectations. As promised, beginning with today's earnings release and each quarter going forward, you will be able to see the HBR components that drive the overall consolidated HBR, commercial, Medicaid and Medicare HBRs.\nIn commercial, you can see the high HBRs in the Q2 and Q3 time frame driven by the risk adjustment items we covered at our June Investor Day and the Delta variant in the third quarter, as we discussed on the Q3 call. Structurally, Medicaid in the high 80s has the highest absolute HBR of the 3 business lines. And Medicare, inclusive of our Medicare Advantage and PDP businesses, posted the 2021 HBR in the mid- to high 80s. As we've said before, we believe there's an opportunity to lower the Medicare HBR as we look to 2023 and beyond.\nAt an investor conference on January 10 this year, we provided insights about the Omicron variant and related COVID inpatient authorizations rising in the back half of December. As an update for January, COVID inpatient authorizations continue to climb and peaked, at least for now, in mid-January. Interestingly, with the Delta variant, Marketplace was the highest peak of our 3 business lines and Medicare was the lowest. With Omicron, Medicare was the highest peak and Marketplace was the lowest. But fortunately, the acuity and, therefore, severity we are seeing with Omicron is lower than the Delta variant, and measures like average length of stay and resulting cost per admit are lower than during prior variants. This seems consistent with the lower acuity seen in the national data. One more item on trend, influenza cases so far continue to be very low compared to a typical year.\nMoving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 9.7% last year. This was in line with our expectation that our SG&A rate would be the highest in the fourth quarter of the year because of open enrollment spending in both Medicare and Marketplace. Year-over-year improvement reflects leveraged expenses over higher revenues.\nSome of you have asked about our SG&A rate and our mix of businesses. So let me give you some perspective relative to the midpoint of adjusted 2022 SG&A guidance of 8.05%. First of all, it's important to remember that we have and will continue to calculate our SG&A rate and margin metrics off of premium and service revenue, which excludes the forecasted $6 billion of pass-through revenue. And as we covered at Investor Day, we're breaking out depreciation from SG&A in 2022 and reporting it on a separate income statement line. We expect depreciation to run a little under $700 million for 2022.\nOn an absolute basis, Magellan increases our SG&A rate by approximately 20 basis points. Our international businesses increased by a little over 30 basis points and our other health care enterprise businesses increased it by about 10 basis points, meaning the midpoint of our adjusted SG&A rate for 2022, excluding those businesses would be in the mid-7s. And our value creation plan is focused on driving that lower over time.\nCash flow provided by operations was $675 million in the quarter primarily driven by net earnings. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $2.3 billion of domestic unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Furthermore, we closed our $2.6 billion Magellan transaction right after year-end, which used our available unregulated cash. Our goal continues to be to build cash at parent beginning in the back half of 2022 for additional share buybacks and debt paydown.\nOn that topic, as Sarah mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our stock using proceeds from the sale of our majority stake in U.S. Medical Management. Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 40.9%, excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $14.2 billion at quarter end and represents 52 days in claims payable compared to 51 in Q3. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect it to strengthen even further as we improve margins and generate cash flow.\nAs we begin 2022, we're building on the positive momentum from our fourth quarter results as well as our organizational commitment to the value creation plan. We are reiterating our full year 2022 financial guidance, including expectations for adjusted earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.50.\nAs you think about the seasonality of 2022 earnings, it looks like consensus is about 58% of adjusted EPS in the first half of the year and 42% in the back half, and that's a pretty good proxy for our estimates. And as you heard from Brent, we are pleased with our execution in the annual enrollment periods for Medicare and Marketplace and are well positioned to achieve our 2022 membership expectations.\nOverall, our 2021 performance demonstrates the strength and agility of our organization. As Sarah touched on, we have a lot of work in motion to drive our multiyear financial commitments in the value creation plan. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year. Thank you for your interest. Operator, Rocco, can you please open the line for questions?"

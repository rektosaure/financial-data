Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded today, October 31, 2025.\nI will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2025 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com.\nSome of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in entering and relying on them. We refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the as operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2021 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC.\nHosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone.\nI want to start by talking about something we probably won't get asked about much during the upcoming Q&A, and that's our Q3 earnings growth. For Q3 2025, we grew our AFFO per share earnings by 5.3% and versus Q3 2024. I want to emphasize our Q3 2025 earnings growth rate because I want to emphasize the earnings growth that our model is capable of producing even in periods of continuing uncertainty.\nWith our Q3 2025 results, the VICI team continues to demonstrate its resourcefulness and resilience in growing relationships to grow our revenues and profits without in the case of 2025, significantly growing our capital base. You will hear more in a moment from John Payne about what the VICI team is doing to continue to grow our portfolio and our income, and you will hear from David on our financial results, balance sheet and updated 2025 earnings guidance.\nBefore we turn to John and David, I want to talk about the wider strategic context in which we are producing our results. And by context, I do not mean the state of the market this week is very weak, which has obviously been a rough week for REITs and for gaming operators. If you wish, we can share our thoughts on this week's market reactions and reductions during the Q&A.\nBy strategic context, I mean the larger context of the world we are living and moreover, we'll be investing in, in the years, not weeks to come. As I've told you before, I do a lot of reading. Some days, I do wonder if I do too much reading. Two weeks ago, I read a guest post in one of my favorite daily newsletters, Odd Lots. That particular day, the Odd Lots Pulpit was given order to Victor Schmitt, Head of Global Desk Strategy at Macquarie Capital. Victor starts by quoting Nobel Prize winner Neil's Bohr, who is often quoted as having said, \"Prediction is very difficult, especially if it is about the future.\" Victor does acknowledge that Yogi Berra evidently said something similar. After summarizing the current year state of our world, Victor states, \"In line with many other prognosticators, I do believe that the next decade will be the most critical period in the transition from yesterday's capitalism toward a yet to be defined alternative system. Everything is up for grabs in what is likely to be one of the most profound changes since the invention of agriculture with far deeper consequences than even the industrial revolutions had.\" Victor goes on to ask, \"Then what are rational investment strategies in response to an irrational world caught in violent transition.\" Victor's preferred answer is, \"To have strong views rather than no views. This involves joining the revolution and backing instead of fighting secular themes, basing investment strategy on a new world and avoiding the waging of old battles.\" He states for the last 10 years his firm has valued building portfolios around sectors and companies that are, \"Supported by long-term structural forces rather than investing based on a heavily degraded reading of economic and capital market cycles.\" With portfolio construction based in part on rising returns on digital capital he then continues, \"Included are several disruptive themes such as the replacement and augmentation of humans, the flow on impact to social, political and geopolitical arenas and the corresponding need for balm, both metaphysical and real.\" Okay, did you get all that, these days, it's hard, at least for me, to determine if Victor's view is on the outer or interspectrum of potential outcomes. But a lot of what he says rings true to me and in any case, I believe that in this period, real estate investors should be developing and executing return and risk management strategies that account for the possibility that Victor will be proven right, that we are in a prolonged period of significant change and that those changes could impact people's desire and need for what Victor calls balm, both metaphysical and real. And just in case I'm not pronouncing it as clearly as I should, he is saying B-A-L-M, balm and not bomb, B-O-M-B. And I take balm to mean what people do to seek connection, entertainment, play-based excitement, both psychological and physical wellness and healing. These are the experiential dimensions, the various dimensions of balm we at VICI have been, are and will continue to be examining, evaluating and potentially investing in through our insight-driven approach, depending, of course, on our determination that these experiences have the investment attributes we rely on. We are mindful, very mindful that at a time like this, it's more important than ever to identify as best we can the risks of oversupply, obsolescence and the other factors that can lead to real estate capital destruction. And through that identification process to determine what we will and will not invest in. It's an approach that has driven what we've done at VICI in the last few years, an approach that has led to investments made and investments avoided. And as you can see from our Q3 2025 results, it's an approach that is delivering growth where it most counts growth in AFFO per share.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone who's on the call.\nAs Ed laid out, we face a market environment the 5 easy explanation. But at VICI, we have already faced multiple unprecedented events in our 8-year history. And through disciplined capital allocation, we have been able to strike the balance between investment, quality and growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced that we'll be adding our 14th tenant, Clairvest, in connection with MGM resource agreement to sell the operations of MGM Northfield Park. Upon closing of the transaction, VICI will enter into a new triple-net lease with an affiliate of Clairvest as well as an amendment to the master lease between VICI and MGM Resorts. The Northfield Park lease will have an initial annual base rent of $53 million or if the transaction closes on or after May 1, 2026. And rent under the MGM master lease will decrease by the same amount. Simply put, this transaction will not change the total amount of rent collected by VICI. Clairvest is a top performing private equity firm out of Toronto, and they are a recognized leader in the gaming sector. Clairvest is a sought-after partner with gaming experience across regional casinos, racetracks, suppliers, technology providers and online gaming globally, having made 17 investments in 37 gaming assets over the last 2 decades. VICI looks forward to further diversifying our tenant roster with a well-respected counterpart in the sector.\nNow casino gaming remains the top focus for VICI. We continue to believe in the durability of the sector despite recent noise around Las Vegas. John Decree at CBRE put it well in his research note earlier this week. Las Vegas has experienced the confluence of idiosyncratic headwinds. The slowdown in visitation this summer influenced by decreased Canadian travel and reduced capacity from Spirit Airlines is definitely something to monitor. But Las Vegas has endured cycles before, and operators are expecting trends to improve through quarter 4 and into 2026. Headlines emphasize short-term trends, but at VICI, we take the long view. We are still big believers in Las Vegas as one of the world's best destinations with operators who are willing and able to adapt their business to meet consumer demand. With that said, some operators have experienced recent strength in Las Vegas. The Venetian, one of our tenants, for example, continues to perform remarkably well with record hotel revenues and gaming volumes this summer. Additionally, according to Venetian management, 2026 is on track to be a great year for the Venetians group business, convention sites in and out of cities each year, but Las Vegas continues to draw solid group demand that supports the segment as other conferences rotate locations. For example, Con Expo, ConAg, America's largest construction trade show that draws nearly 140,000 attendees takes place every 3 years is set to happen in Las Vegas in March of 2026. We believe the convention business in Las Vegas is an underappreciated mitigant to the cyclical nature of leisure-oriented business.\nIn 2024, convention visitors spent $1,681 per trip. That is 33% higher than the average leisure visitor, and the strength of Las Vegas as a convention city has continued to gain momentum post-pandemic. VICI owns nearly 6 million square feet of convention of conference convention and trade show at on the Las Vegas Strip, and representatives from several blue-chip large cap companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, attend conferences in Las Vegas every year. VICI continues to believe in the strength and resiliency of Las Vegas.\nOver the last 8 years, VICI has been deliberate with its portfolio construction, and we believe we've made the company better each time we grew bigger, our multidimensional investment evaluation bolsters the quality of our decisions as real estate owners, and we can put rigorous analysis with each opportunity that comes across our desk. At any given time, we consistently have multiple ongoing dialogues with gaming and other experiential operators, and what we want to continue to do, which is what has earned its credibility thus far, is maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy that facilitates quality growth. We do not aim to grow through sakes. We do not seek to compromise creditworthiness to reach for return. We instead engage in selective sustainable capital allocation that can provide long-term growth and withstand potential near-term macro shocks. We are long-term stewards of capital, and VICI aims to make decisions that support sustained and sustainable growth that delivers value to our shareholders.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John.\nTouching on our financial results, AFFO per share was $0.60 for the quarter, an increase of 5.3% compared to $0.57 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. These results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins run in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $16.3 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues, was only 1.6%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs. On September 4, we declared a dividend of $0.45 per share, representing a 4% increase from the prior dividend amount and our eighth consecutive annual dividend increase since VICI's inception. We are very proud to deliver this consistent increase to our owners.\nTouching on liquidity on the balance sheet. During the quarter, we settled a total 12.1 million shares under our forward sale agreements and received approximately $376 million in net proceeds with a portion of these proceeds being used to repay $175 million of the outstanding balance on our credit facility. Our total debt is $17.1 billion, and our net debt to annualized third quarter adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5x at the low end of our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.47% as adjusted to account our hedge activity and a weighted average 6.2 years to maturity.\nTurning to guidance. We are updating our AFFO guidance for 2025 on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025, is now expected to be between $2.51 billion and $2.52 billion or between $2.36 and $2.37 per diluted common share. Compared to our prior FFO per share guidance of $2.35 to $2.37 per share, the raise represents an increase of the lower end by $0.01. Based on the midpoint of our updated 2025 guidance, VICI now expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4.6%. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other nonrecurring transactions or items.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today by going back to what I talked about in my opening remarks during our last earnings call in late April. In those remarks, I spoke of the paramount importance of the VICI dividend in creating value for VICI shareholders. Those remarks struck a cord for a lot of you, as the feedback we received from many of our active management owners was along the line of the dividend is indeed important, and we're glad you're focused on it. .\nToday, I want to build on those remarks by focusing on what the dividend critically contributes to, and that's total return. Total return is, of course, the function of dividend return plus dependent on valuation and incremental return generated by the capitalization of earnings growth. In a recent note, in early July, the BofA equity strategist, Savita Subramanian, wrote this headline, welcome back to a total return world. Savita goes on to say, and I quote, \"We expect a rising contribution to total return from dividends. Dividends contributed 40% of total returns from 1936 to 2021, but just over 16% over the past decade. From here, we think the contribution of dividends to returns could rise demonstrably. With aging demographics and sticky inflation risks, the supply-demand argument for inflation protected income via stocks is, in our view, compelling and bullish.\"\nSavita was recently featured in Wall Street Journal cover story on this topic of total return and the contribution of dividends to total return. In that article as well as in a podcast with The Meb Favor, Savita shares an analysis of nearly 100 years of total return from the Russell 1000. And in that analysis, she finds that the highest total returns over that period have been generated by stocks with higher dividends, specifically by stocks in the second and first quintiles of dividend yield in that order.\nWhile stocks were the lowest dividend yields, this quintile significantly lagged the returns of higher-yielding stocks and not by a little, but by quite a lot, nearly 4x higher return for the second quintile and about 2.5x for the first quintile versus the fifth quintile according to the Wall Street Journal.\nAgain, what Savita stresses is the dividend return is a key driver of delivering superior total return along with the capitalization of earnings growth. In the case of VICI, we see our total return building blocks as having 3 key components: dividend return, capitalization of same-store earnings growth and capitalization of new store growth, whether through new acquisitions or property or new loans on property.\nOur 2025 same and new store growth expectations are embedded in the updated 2025 earnings guidance. David will discuss in detail with you shortly. The midpoint of our revised 2025 guidance now calls for 4.4% growth in AFFO per share versus 2024. We believe this growth rate within the net lease REIT category will put us among the leaders in AFFO per share growth for 2025.\nTo date in 2025, we are generating our earnings growth through a combination of same-store earnings growth and new store external growth. When it comes to same-store earnings growth, VICI's owners benefit from a same-store NOI growth rate that, according to [ Green Street's ] latest published net lease research is over 5x higher than the average projected rate of same-store NOI growth for net lease REITs.\nOur external or new store growth has been funded substantially through the deployment of our retained cash flow, meaning at this point, we are growing our 2025 earnings without significantly growing our share count and without significantly growing our net debt. What you are seeing though this internally funded growth, are the advantages of VICI having achieved our current level of scale with more than $600 million a year of retained cash flow available for investment.\nI will also note that we are converting our revenue growth to earnings growth at a high rate of flow-through given our continuing discipline around our G&A costs, which as percentages of both revenues and assets are among the lowest of large cap REITs. We believe our current use of our internal funding capability or what we call capital markets independence together with exacting cost discipline is a sound strategy for defending our dividend, growing our earnings and creating the conditions that can potentially lead to compelling total return no matter if external funding windows are open or closed.\nTo be sure, we may in the quarters and years ahead to develop investment opportunities require and also accretively support issuance of incremental equity and debt in greater size. But for the time being, we believe we are serving our stakeholders well by generating earnings growth and striving for compelling total return without significant equity and credit market reliance.\nBefore I turn the call over to John, I'll finish by repeating what Savita said. Welcome back to a total return world. Here at VICI, we always live in a total return world, and that's because we always believe in the power of compounding. Total return is the power source of compounding. No matter what the market does, we never lose faith in that power. And now over to you, John.\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. VICI's power source of compounding, our total return, is supported by our disciplined approach to building a high-quality portfolio and cultivating a network of best-in-class operating partners. The investments announced during the second quarter was Red Rock Resorts as well as King International and Eldridge Industries exemplify the relationship-based nature of our capital and the dynamic operators with whom we seek to partner.\nAs we shared on our first quarter earnings call, we entered into an agreement to provide up to $510 million for the development of the North Fork Mono Casino Resort, which will be developed and managed by Red Rock Resorts. Red Rock Resorts is a best-in-class gaming developer and operator with decades of experience across commercial and tribal assets. We are thrilled to initiate our partnership through this project as we have known and have wanted to work with the Red Rock team for years.\nDuring the second quarter, we also increased our investment in the mezzanine loan related to the development of the One Beverly Hills by $150 million for a total commitment of $450 million. We initially launched our strategic relationship with Kane International and Eldridge Industries through our investment in One Beverly Hills during the first quarter, and our incremental investment is representative of the continued partnership.\nWe look forward to continue to support Kane International and Eldridge Industries on the One Beverly Hills development as they work on their next leg of financing for the project. Cultivating new relationships is a key for VICI, but the quality of our existing real estate portfolio and the quality of our operators behind it is the foundation of VICI's sustained growth. While recent headlines around Las Vegas have focused on slowing visitation, dips in gross gaming revenue and a decrease in Canadian travel, we remain confident in the city's long-term trajectory.\nAs Las Vegas has experienced multiple years of record-breaking growth, so it is not unexpected to see a period of normalization, particularly as it laps a Super Bowl year amidst broader economic uncertainty. As Steve Hill, the CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, recently noted, the higher-end consumer remains resilient on the Las Vegas Strip with higher-end properties still running at over 90% occupancy levels.\nThe lower end consumer who is budget conscious is the consumer who has declined recently and the operators of the [ lower-tier ] properties are already making adjustment to attract that cohort. From VICI's perspective, our Las Vegas Strip real estate portfolio continues to be well positioned. Importantly, although these near-term dynamics may impact operator performance, VICI's rental income remains well insulated from cyclical fluctuations in our tenants financial. That is the value of our model.\nLong-term leases, 90% of which by rent roll, include corporate guarantees that serve as a powerful risk mitigant. Guaranteeing rent at the parent level adds cushion to VICI's overall lease coverage, allowing operators to pay rent from the total system, not just brick-and-mortar earnings thus limiting the idiosyncratic risk of any one geography or asset. This structure has also supported VICI's track record of 100% rent collection in cash on time since inception.\nEven as Las Vegas experiences what we believe to be temporary moderation, we have conviction in both the staying power of the city as a global entertainment epicenter and in the creativity of our operating partners. A recent article from the Las Vegas weekly discusses how operators are focusing on attracting new generations as millennials overtake GenX in visitor volume share. The article highlights millennial and Gen Z taste for experiences different than the traditional gambling enjoyed by their parents and grandparents and experiential innovation is evident on the Las Vegas Strip with the starting of date club concepts, elevated food and beverage experiences, increasing popularity of professional sports and more.\nThere are also long-term tailwinds for Las Vegas including the planned construction of the Brightline West high-speed rail line, the extension of the F1 contract through 2027 and the forthcoming addition of the [ Ace ] Stadium. We feel very fortunate to be woven into the fabric of this iconic city and excited about the opportunity we believe continues to be offered in the years ahead.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Greatly appreciate you all joining us today. Starting with the balance sheet and recent activity. In April, we closed our bond offering, where we issued $400 million of 3-year notes at a coupon of 4.75% and $900 million of [ 10-year ] notes at a coupon of 5.625% for a blended coupon of 5.34%, including the impact of our hedging program. We now have no debt coming due until the second half of 2026, where we have September and December maturities, which we plan to address next year.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we settled approximately 9.7 million shares under our forward equity ATM program for $296 million of net proceeds, which were partially used to repay $175 million that was outstanding on our revolving credit facility and to fund the incremental One Beverly Hills investment. Taking this activity into account, we have approximately $2.9 billion in total liquidity comprised of $325.6 million of estimated proceeds now available under our outstanding forwards, $2.4 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility and approximately $233 million in cash as of quarter end.\nTouching on leverage when we account for the revolver repayment, our total debt is $17.1 billion, and our net debt to annualized second quarter adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.1x, well within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.47% as adjusted to account for our hedge activity and a weighted average 6.5 years to maturity.\nOur constant focus on managing our cost of capital, balance sheet and liquidity profile through volatile markets allows our team to remain opportunistic in an effort to continue pursuing our sustained and sustainable return goals for our shareholders.\nAnd turning to the income statement. FFO per share was $0.60 for the quarter, an increase of 4.9% compared to $0.57 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $14.6 million for the quarter. And as Ed mentioned, as a percentage of total revenue, was only 1.5%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs. And finally, moving to guidance. As we announced last night, we are raising our AFFO guidance for 2025 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis.\nAFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025, is now expected to be between $2.5 billion and $2.52 billion or between $2.35 and $2.37 per diluted common share compared to our prior AFFO per share guidance of $2.33 to $2.36, the raise represents an increase at both ends of the range by $0.02 on the bottom and $0.01 on the top end.\nAnd based on the midpoint of our raised 2025 guidance, VICI now expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4.4%. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activities, or other nonrecurring transactions or items. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning.

Over the next few minutes, John will talk to you about our exciting new relationship with Red Rock Resorts and our other growth activities, and then David will discuss our recent refinancing, our results and our increased guidance.\nTo start, I'd like to share my thoughts on what we at VICI anchor to in all times, especially in periods of high volatility and low certainty. And that is working to ensure that we maintain our ability to sustain and grow the current cash income we distribute to our stockholders in the form of our dividend. For a REIT management team, that should, of course, be standard operating procedure. And because of that, one might think that the sustaining and growing of dividends would be top of mind for REIT investors as well.\nAgain, one would think and yet, when we meet with our investors, which we do with great frequency, many of them will end the meeting by asking, is there anything we didn't ask about that other investors are asking about. When we are asked this question, we often answer with, well, you didn't ask about our dividend, but don't feel bad because very few investors do. Call it old fashioned, but I believe strongly that dividends should always be a top-of-mind topic, especially for REITs, but frankly, for most equity investments. As I'm sure you all know, over the long term, the last 100 years, dividends have contributed about 1/3 of the S&P 500's total return, and that's despite the fact that the long-term dividend yield of the S&P 500 has averaged under 2% over the last 30 years.\nGiven the greater dividend yield of REITs, dividends, of course, matter even more to REIT total returns. As of yesterday's close, the trailing 5-year total return of the RMZ REIT Index was 54%, of which 27% was price return and 27% was dividend return. Over that same 5-year period, which I should note started in the spring 2020 COVID drawdown for stocks, VICI has generated 138 percentage points of total return, of which 84 points come from price return and about 54 points come from dividend return. I will also note that during that same 5-year period, the S&P 500 generated 106 percentage points of return, of which 91 points were price return and 15 points were dividend return.\nAs you can see, over that 5-year period, dividends were a major factor in VICI outperforming the S&P 500 by a margin of over 30 percentage points or by about 30%. Over the last year or 2, especially given the MAG 7's dominance of investor mind and market share, dividends didn't get a lot of attention. But it's been interesting in recent weeks amidst the volatility of both equity and credit markets to see dividends being talked about again. One of my favorite readings each week is [indiscernible] weekly flow show Bulletin, which tends to come out late Thursday evening or early Friday morning. In his April 11 bulletin in his imminently cryptic way, Michael made the following points, and I quote, on portfolios, we say, a, own credit, e.g. long-dated, high-quality U.S. corporate bonds, many yielding 5% to 6%; b, on equity income. 71 companies within the S&P 500 have a dividend yield greater than 4%, 41 have a dividend yield greater than 5%, buy stocks that can defend dividend.\nDid you get that? As you get Michael's point that as of his writing on April 11, only 71 companies in the S&P 500 had dividend yields above 4% and only 41 had dividends above 5%. What's notable about those dividend yields, especially the greater than 5% dividend yield, is that those yields are comfortably above the current rate of inflation and then thus generate a meaningful real return in a world where real return matters as much as ever. As a fellow VICI stockholder, it [indiscernible] me to point out that as an S&P 500 stock, VICI currently offers a dividend yield greater than 5%. And we believe that, that dividend yield is, to paraphrase Michael Hartnett, a defended dividend. In the coming weeks and months, equity market volatility may die down or it may not. who really knows. But whether market volatility dies down or not, a well-defended dividend can and I believe likely will be a significant contributor to total return for the market as a whole and for VICI and its stockholders. Everything we do at VICI is ultimately about total return in all of its key components.\nAnd so now I'll turn the call over to John and David, who will talk further about what we're doing to drive total return over the near and long term through our growth activities and through balance sheet and cost of capital optimization. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. VICI is very proud of our core ability to develop relationships and convert them into valuable long-term investment partnerships. Not only were we able to successfully do this with Kane and [indiscernible] teams in connection with One Beverly Hills earlier in the first quarter, but subsequent to quarter end, we closed our first transaction in partnership with Red Rock Resorts connected to the development of a casino on tribal land in Central California. As announced in our earnings release last night on April 4, VICI committed up to $510 million of a delayed draw term loan facility for the development of the North Fork Mono Casino and Resort, which will be developed and managed by Red Rock Resorts.\nRed Rock is a premier gaming, development and management company that operates productive assets in attractive geographies, and they've developed over $9 billion of regional gaming and entertainment destinations. They are also an established leader in native American gaming, have developed and managed tribal casinos for over 20 years. Red Rock broke ground on the North Fork project in September 2024 and expects it to be completed by September of 2026. Upon completion, the casino is expected to feature 2,400 slot machines, 40 table games, 2 restaurants, 3 bars, a food hall and a small retail offering. The 305-acre site located in [indiscernible], California directly adjacent to Highway 99, where 4.2 million people live within a 2-hour drive of the North Oak site.\nThis transaction established a formal relationship between VICI and Red Rock and represent Red Rock's first partnership with a REIT. For VICI, it represents our first gaming investment on tribal land and our second investment on tribal land overall, with the first being our Great Wolf Northeast loan announced in February of 2023. Lending on tribal land in partnership with a high-quality gaming operator in Red Rock demonstrates VICI's ability to drive high-quality opportunities for continued investment in the gaming sector. Another benefit of VICI's relationship-based approach is that it fosters close communication with each of our tenants. Having just 13 tenants and 8 financing partners on our roster allows us to maintain consistent and frequent dialogue with all of them, which is particularly advantageous during this volatile time such as these.\nWe believe this level of communication, coupled with the monthly financial reporting received from the majority of our tenants, provides VICI with strong oversight of our portfolio. Looking across our portfolio, we continue to be big believers in Las Vegas as there are just so many unique demand drivers that continue to fuel the city's activity. For example, over the Easter weekend, Las Vegas hosted WWE's WrestleMania at Allegiant Stadium, drawing nearly 125,000 fans and marking the largest gate for any event in WWE's history. T-Mobile Arena has also hosted -- has recently hosted packed houses for Stanley Cup playoff games and the musical talent at -- the Sphere remains a compelling draw for the city.\nAdditionally, during the first quarter, tens of thousands of guests attending conferences hosted by companies like Home Depot and Adobe flooded the city with activity. While a potential international travel slowdown has come into question, we would note that only 12% of Las Vegas visitation in 2024 was from international travelers. It is also possible that Las Vegas may benefit from a domestic trade-down effect if Americans forego international destinations. In regional gaming, we continue to monitor the landscape and based on prior periods of heightened market volatility, we expect performance to be relatively resilient.\nProperty performance will vary based on geography and asset. And at VICI, we focus on working with our tenants so they feel positioned to continue to successfully operate the properties we own. Like I said, partnership is at the core of what we do. It is one of the key factors underlying our success in building this company as it drives current and future opportunities and allows our team to consistently seek to create value for our shareholders.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we greatly appreciate your time. Starting with our Q1 capital markets activity and balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we very successfully addressed all of our 2025 maturities, and now we have no debt maturing until September of 2026. On March 26, we placed our bond offering and at its peak, our order book was 6x oversubscribed. We issued $400 million of 3-year notes at a coupon of 4.75% and $900 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 5.625% or a blended coupon of 5.34%, including the impact of our hedging program. During the quarter, we also sold 7.8 million shares, raising $254 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward.\nAnd as I mentioned on our last call, in February, we recast our $2.5 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility and extended the maturity until 2029, providing us additional duration and an ample source of liquidity. We have approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity comprised of approximately $334 million in cash, $625 million under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.\nOur net debt to annualized first quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.3x within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5. Taking into account our recent bond refinancing activity, we have a weighted average interest rate of 4.47% as adjusted to account for our hedge activity and a weighted average 6.7 years to maturity.\nOur proactive risk management of our cost of capital, of our balance sheet and of our liquidity profile through volatile markets allows our team to stay focused on building relationships and our investment pipeline. This allows VICI to continue pursuing our sustained and sustainable return goals for our shareholders without having to go pencils down for any period of time. Just touching on the income statement. AFFO per share was $0.58 for the quarter, an increase of 4.3% compared to $0.56 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $14.9 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.5%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector, but across all REITs.\nTurning to guidance. And as we noted in our release last night, we are raising our AFFO guidance for 2025 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025, is now expected to be between $2.47 billion and $2.5 billion or between $2.33 and $2.36 per diluted common share. Compared to our prior AFFO per share guidance of $2.32 to $2.35, the raise represents an increase of $0.01 at both ends of the range.\nBased on the midpoint of our increased 2025 guidance, VICI now expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 3.8%. And just as a reminder, our AFFO per share guidance. Our AFFO guidance, excuse me, does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 21, 2025.\nI'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Please go ahead.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com.\nSome of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, our supplemental information and our other filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC.\nHosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Laurie McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Over the course of the next few minutes, leading into our Q&A session, you'll hear from John Payne on our growth activities, and you'll hear from David Kieske on our financial results, financing activities and initial 2025 earnings guidance.\nI'll start the call with a few words about the announcement we made Wednesday morning, initiating a new VICI strategic and financial relationship with Cain International and Eldridge Industries through an initial investment in the financing of the One Beverly Hills development. Like most of VICI's growth activities, this VICI investment is a result of our growing a new relationship. This relationship began last May when on a trip to London, I spent time with Jonathan Goldstein, the founding CEO of Cain International, a diversified global real estate development and investment company. By the end of our hour, Jonathan and I agreed that we should find ways to work together. Our urge to work together grew out of the recognition that we share convictions and we share values.\nWe share conviction in the secular strength for years to come of experiences. We share cultural and ethical values around partnership. Put another way, the meeting of Cain and VICI is a meeting of minds and a meeting of ambitions, particularly the shared ambition to invest in differentiated place-based experiences when those experiences are entertainment, hospitality, wellness or sport based. For those of you not familiar with Cain, which as of year-end 2024, had nearly $18 billion in assets under management. It was founded in 2014 by Jonathan and his partner, Todd Bowley, and is affiliated with Eldridge Industries, an investment company founded and led by Todd Bowley.\nCain and Eldridge have made investments in iconic experiential brands that include Aman, Delano, St. James Sports Clubs, [indiscernible] and Flexjet. Todd is an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Lakers and both Todd and Jonathan are owners of [indiscernible] in the English Premier League.\nAs 2024 went by, Jonathan asked that Cain's development of One Beverly Hills might be our first opportunity to work together. These discussions enabled Cain, Eldridge and VICI to get to know each other better, and over the last few months, we all came to believe that our shared conviction around place-based experiences could yield as many compelling opportunities to work together in the years to come. And that's why as well as announcing our One Beverly Hills investment on Wednesday, Cain, Eldridge and VICI also announced our joint signing of a letter of intent, expressing our intention to work collaboratively to identify and pursue experiential investment opportunities that meet our respective investment objectives.\nAs you would have seen, if you review the investment deck we posted to our website, One Beverly Hill stands to rank among the most compelling American luxury hospitality, retail and residential developments in recent history. The development is currently rising out of over 17.5 of the best-located acres in Beverly Hills, a triangle bordered by Wilter Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard and the L.A. Country Club. This development is centered on the Aman brand among the world's most venerated luxury hospitality brands. One Beverly Hills will be the largest realization of [indiscernible] branded hospitality, wellness and living to date with an Aman Hotel, and Aman wellness spa and Aman Club and 2 Aman residential towers.\nThe development will also include a full renovation of the legendary Beverly Hilton longtime host site of the Golden Globes and the Milken conference as well as 10 acres of botanical gardens and open space with high-end retail and dining offerings.\nCapital is a key fuel for ambitious placemakers and experienced creators. Cain stands among the most ambitious place makers we have come to know and yet Cain balances that ambition with what we've seen to be strong capability in development risk management. We believe multigenerational, multinational demand for the differentiated experience within the differentiated place will create abundant opportunities for Cain and Eldridge in the coming decades, and we're excited about the prospect of becoming a long-term partner in their growth. This announcement of our new partnership with Cain and Eldridge represents our first new venture in what we hope will be a year of new investment ventures in both gaming and non-gaming. For more on that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. I'll start by reiterating enthusiasm around the new strategic relationship we formed with Cain and Eldridge. As we've said time and time again, deep relationships are at the core of VICI's investment strategy. Through the development of a new relationship with Home field, Kansas City and the strength of existing relationships with Great Wolf and the team from Venetian, we were able to commit approximately $1.1 billion of capital in 2024 at an initial yield of 8.1%.\nThe quality and scale of our existing portfolio also accrues to the value of our platform. Since our last earnings call in early November, the VICI team attended the NAREIT Conference in Las Vegas. The conference provided a great opportunity to physically showcase our Las Vegas Strip assets and convey the incredible scale of operations happening at these properties every single day. For example, the Venetian to which we committed up to $700 million in 2024 through our partner property growth fund strategy, sprawls over 17 million square feet, it is being proactively reimagined across several business verticals, including convention, food and beverage, hotel rooms, gaming floor optimization, entertainment and more to drive the continued growth of the operating business as well as capitalize on the sphere, which sits behind the Venetian.\nIn RJ Milligan's NAREIT recap note, he observed that I quote \"with all the events in and around Las Vegas, it was hard to ignore the quality of VICI's real estate, which we don't think the market is giving them enough credit for. It's just so hard to comprehend that VICI was able to purchase the Venetian at the same cap rate as a well-located dollar general, \" well stated RJ.\nLas Vegas tourism also continues to hit records. According to the LVCVA, 2024 saw record airline passengers through Harry Reid Airport at [ $58 million ] for the year and visitation to the city increased 2% year-over-year to approximately $42 million. Our operating partners recognize the value in proactively investing in and reinventing experiences at our assets to capitalize on demand. For example, MGM Grand recently announced a $300 million remodel of all of their 4,200 hotel rooms to be completed in December of 2025, and launched their Palm Tree Beach Club outdoor music and entertainment venue, which will open in May of 2025. Caesars New Orleans just opened following a comprehensive $435 million renovation and the property hosted many Super Bowl goers a couple of weeks ago.\nAnd in November of last year, Harvey's Lake Tahoe also announced a $100 million all-incumpency transformational project just since the fourth quarter, our operators have announced nearly $1 billion of investments in our real estate. That is reflective of our shared conviction around the value of high-quality experiences at high-quality properties.\nVICI believes that the quality and scale of investment opportunity in our existing properties as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain deep relationships with our partners will provide springboard for future growth.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance.\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'm going to start with our balance sheet. As we begin 2025, 7 years after our IPO in 2018, I want to highlight 2024 reflect on how far our balance sheet has come since well going way back to our pre-emergence in the summer of 2017, when VICI had total leverage of roughly 10.5x debt-to-EBITDA. We were born with a very unnatural balance sheet for a REIT, short tenor, secured debt, second lien debt, a $1.6 billion CMBS loan that matured in 2022, all instruments that we knew were not consistent with becoming the blue-chip REIT, we do we should and could become. .\nAfter we emerged in October of 2017, we got to work on fixing our balance sheet. We started to chip away the second lien notes with our IPO and retired the remaining $498 million in February 2020 in connection with the Eldorado Caesars merger, we retired the CMBS debt. And with our acquisition of MGP, we were able to retire all of our remaining secured debt and received an investment-grade credit rating from S&P and Fitch in April of 2022.\nThere was one straggler at that time, Moody's. Through the leadership of [indiscernible], we put our heads down and worked with Moody's over the next 2 years to educate them on the merits of gaming, the resiliency of our tenants' business and the quality of our balance sheet. That work paid off with the Moody's upgrade we received on November 18, 2024, giving us an investment-grade credit rating across all 3 agencies. The ratings upgrade should accrue to our benefit with an improved access to and cost of capital over time. We believe our balance sheet and unsecured debt complex is one of the more liquid debt complexes across the weak landscape with total debt of $17.1 billion, which we have unsecured debt of $14.1 billion. This creates liquidity in our unsecured notes, and we saw this in our December refinancing where we had several new institutional credit investors coming to our offering.\nThe quality of our balance sheet was also highlighted during our recent recast of our unsecured revolving credit facility, which we closed subsequent to quarter end with a new $2.5 billion facility. We had strong sponsorship from our bank group and want to thank each and every institution that committed to that facility and the conviction they all have in our balance sheet and business.\nWe have approximately $3.3 billion in total liquidity comprised of approximately $525 million in cash, $376 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards and $2.4 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to annualized fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity was approximately 5.3x within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.41% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.4 years to maturity. Again, thank you to Aaron and the entire team for the work that has been completed, but know that we are not done with a continual focus on improving our balance sheet.\nTouching on the income statement, the AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 3.6% compared to $0.55 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. For the full year 2024, AFFO per share was $2.26, an increase of 5.1% compared to $2.15 for the full year 2023. Our results highlight our highly efficient triple net model, given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $20.7 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.1%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector, but across all REITs.\nTurning to guidance. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2025 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025, is expected to be between $2.455 billion and $2.485 billion, or between $2.32 and $2.35 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our 2025 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 3.3%, a very solid starting point as we begin 2025. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact of operating results from any transactions that have not closed interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. With that operator, please open the line for questions."

Good morning, everyone. As you may have figured out by now, I enjoyed putting my thoughts together for VICI's earnings call. I try to hear through these opening remarks, not only what we've done, but what we're observing and learning from the marketplace. I may not always succeed in sharing anything genuinely fresh, but at the very least, I don't want my opening remarks to become repetitive.\nWhen I began putting these thoughts together in early July, the risk of repetitive remarks was high given that, until a couple of weeks ago, for REITs generally and net lease REIT specifically, not a lot had changed since last quarter's earnings call when I spoke of the big tech investing party that we REITs hadn't been invited to. In Bank of America's most recent fund manager survey, Michael Hart showed that fund managers were underweight real estate at a level equal to and not being since the great -- the depth of the great financial crisis.\nThen came a welcome CPI print and REITs have begun to come back that we believe can endure. Before you hear from John and David, and before we field your questions, let me say a few words about the principles that guide us in a REIT marketplace like the ones we've been living through for a while now.\nWe start by asking ourselves is what we're going through, whether for all REITs generally or net lease REIT specifically, cyclical or secular in nature. There are REIT sectors that have secular issues right now. Office is an obvious example of a sector with negative secular trends. Data centers is the obvious sector with positive secular trends. We strong believe that experiential real estate is another real estate category with positive secular trends as evidenced by research recently published by McKinsey showing that indexed back to 1959, the share of consumer discretionary income spent on experiences has grown to an index level of nearly 160, while the share of consumer discretionary income spent on things has shrunk to less than 75.\nCapitalizing on positive secular trends is fun, addressing negative secular trends, not so much. Positive cycles for REITs are fun, negative cycles for our specific REIT sector not so much. But it's always key to remember that cycles begin and cycles end, almost always driven by factors that are beyond the control of a REIT management team and Board.\nIn a period of lagging stock performance, driven by cyclical factors, it can be tempting for REIT management teams and boards to start deviating from the REIT's long-term goals and strategies in hopes that the deviation can somehow overcome the cycle. At VICI, we strive very hard not to deviate. Here's the strategic principle we strive to stay true to in all cycles.\nWe dedicate ourselves to investing in experiential buildings that meet these 3 fundamental quality factors. Location quality, in other words, well located in markets that have sound fundamental demographics and economics. Asset quality, meaning designed and built to serve the distinct needs of experiential businesses that have high economic dynamism and economic durability. Operator quality, meaning occupied by an experiential operator that has high economic energy, ingenuity and expertise, and a strong balance sheet and credit profile.\nWith every investment we make, we, of course, seek accretion as measured in AFFO per share. But that is not the only accretion we seek and measure. With every investment opportunity we evaluate, in addition to AFFO accretion, we ask, is a given investment opportunity accretive to asset quality? Is a given investment accretive to tenant diversity and tenant quality? Is a given investment accretive to geographic and potentially categorical diversity and quality? Finally, can it give an investment be accretive to balance sheet quality and, potentially, our credit ratings?\nWe have not and will not grow for growth's sake, if that growth doesn't continuously improve the quality and intrinsic value of our portfolio and balance sheet. We will not, as some of our net lease peers do, tell you we spend x hundreds of millions of dollars and y percentage cap rate to generate z dollars of new rent, but then never tell you into what we invested that amount of money. We will tell you what we invest in so that you can know what you own. The very good news is that our business development team, led by John Payne, is identifying and developing opportunities to meet our broader accretion criteria.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. We acted on the investment criteria Ed just spoke of when, in the second quarter, we made capital commitments of up to $950 million in the highly differentiated experiential buildings that have expensible value to their occupants, namely the Venetian and a collection of Great Wolf Resorts. These are investments that live up to our quality criteria. And at the same time, the $650 million firmly committed to those investments will generate a blended investment yield of 7.9%.\nOur conviction that we can continue to identify and invest in experiential process that are accretive against multiple quality factors is a key reason that we have decided that we will not be exercising our call right to acquire [indiscernible] Leisure Park in Horseshoe, Indianapolis. We can and are making this decision because of our confidence and conviction that we are actively identifying and pursuing investment opportunities that enable us to generate future AFFO growth and accretion, while furthering the strength and diversity of our portfolio and tenant roster.\nAt this time, we believe that we have the opportunity to create greater portfolio value by allocating VICI's capital to other gaming and nongaming opportunities the team is actively pursuing. This is an approach that we believe will produce 2024 AFFO [indiscernible], bit higher in our net lease category. And with our newly [indiscernible], we're in 2024 growth 2% at the midpoint is nearly 3x the 2024 AFFO per growth rate guided into last week by our one gaming REIT peer. The factor that continues to accrue to our overall portfolio quality and structured tenant credit is the success of the dynamic city of Las Vegas, where COVID collects [ 45% ] of our rent from assets that we own.\nOver the years, I've cited on record-breaking [indiscernible] in the first half of 2024. Harry Read International Airport had back-to-back record months reporting 5.1 million passengers arriving and parting in June. June was the third best month ever. Trailing May, the second best month ever. And October of 2023 was the best month ever. In May, international visitation of Vegas also jumped 23% year-over-year. And in June, it was reported that city officials are contemplating adding a second airport to Las Vegas, with executives from Southwest Airlines stating and I quote, \"It feels like any flight we add in a Vegas gets filled. It's almost this insatiable appetite for people wanting to come and see Vegas.\"\nOur Las Vegas tenants continue to benefit from this momentum as evidenced by our up to $700 million capital investment to extensive reinvestment projects at the Venetian in exchange for increased rent. The size and the success of our gaming properties allows us a unique opportunity to put large dollars to work into assets we already own. There continues to be a variety of opportunities on the horizon [indiscernible] to the growth of our portfolio.\nCasino gaming assets continue to present the largest opportunity, both domestically and internationally, inclusive of investment opportunities into the casino resort properties we already own. The magnitude and consistency of gaming cash flows and the creativity of our gaming tenants continue to drive conviction in this section, and have set the blueprint REIT to extend our TAM and other experiential centers.\nI now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. [indiscernible] liquidity results and our updated full year guidance, which we are very excited about. As we work on the right side of the balance sheet, we are constantly focusing on VICI's balance sheet quality, bringing our leverage further down within our range of 5 to 5.5x, diligently working with the rating agencies to improve our credit ratings over time and ultimately lowering our cost of capital, balancing the right long-term leverage for the company, all while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our owners.\nIn terms of dry powder, as of today, we have approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $347 million in cash and cash equivalents, $566 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards and $2.2 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold 4 million shares and received approximately $115 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds were used to partially fund the Venetian capital investment John mentioned earlier.\nIn terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized second quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled foreign equity is approximately 4.4x -- excuse me, 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into [indiscernible] portfolio at a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity.\nTouching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 5.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We are very proud to deliver this continued consistent growth to our owners. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range [indiscernible] when eliminating noncash items. And we have the highest net income margin in the S&P 500 as noted in an article published by Barron's during the month of July.\nOur G&A was $15.8 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, it was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance. We are raising our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending [ December ] 31, 2024, is expected to now be between $2.35 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.24 and $2.26 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance range, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4.7%.\nAs a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we have mentioned in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis which was its inherent unpredictability leaves us enable forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of productivity on our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 2, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them.\nI refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance.\nThese measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2024 earnings release our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC.\nFor additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Move McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter of 2024 was, shall we say, an interesting quarter in the American equity marketplace. A fair part of the S&P 500 packed into our house and held a magnificent party. One Wall Street shop went so far as to say the party reached the rarified state of euphoria. Euphoria, that sounds kind of fun. But to be clear, American REITs were not invited to this party.\nThose of us who work within REITs were out in the curve outside that party house. From the outside, one could wonder if this was a party in which new Monarch were being coronated for perpetual rule eventually ends with ambulances and/or cops being called and a few of the partygoers, fleeing naked down the street out of their mines like Will Ferrell and Old School.\nThe first quarter of 2024 is now over. The ambulances or cops haven't necessarily showed up yet, but the party inside that magnificent house seems to be running out of steam. The Move Index, which measures U.S. treasury market volatility was relatively high but relatively steady through much of the first quarter and even fell a bit in late March and a flight to safety.\nBut in early April, started acting routing again. And it's much the same to the VICI's equity volatility index, which having slipped through much of the magnificent party recently spiked almost 50% since the start of the year before settling back down. Amidst all this noise, the general investment marketplace is having a hard time focusing on the income and capital appreciation dynamics of good REITs.\nAt VICI, we can deal with all of this. We don't spend a lot of time standing on curves, wondering or complaining about parties we're not invited to. We just keep doing what we do at VICI, and that's working within our resources and capabilities to keep improving and growing our company for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders.\nThat's what we did in Q1 2024. The first quarter of 2024 was a quarter in which we produced 6.1% growth in AFFO per share over Q1 2023 and continue to flow our revenue growth through to the EBITDA line and what we believe is one of the higher rates among S&P 500 REITs. The first quarter of 2024 was also a quarter in which we focused on 3 key strategic imperatives: imperative number one, expanding our scope and TAM and investment with our investment in Home field, Kansas City, a market-leading sports training complex that will also soon feature a Margarita Ville resort.\nThis is an investment that builds on our initial entry into the sports and recreation sector with a late 2023 acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in Chelsea peers, an investment that validates the use of our lending platform to ultimately acquire a real estate interest.\nIn this case, 780,000 magnificent square feet of New York recreational and entertainment space on the Hudson River. Imperative number two, being ready to refinance our maturing 2024 debt at an opportune time, debt that would have come due on May 1 yesterday, in other words.\nDuring Q1, May 1st seemed a fair way off, but given the volatility of market conditions, we didn't want to wait too long. [Audio Gap]\nImperative #3, which we've just announced, capitalizing on the scale and rarity of our existing assets by working throughout Q1 with our partners at Apollo to develop a property enhancement plan for the Venetian, which gives VICI the opportunity to invest up to $700 million of capital into this magnificent Las Vegas Strip asset.\nIn a moment, John and David will give you more color on each of these 3 Q1 2024 imperatives. I'll close out my opening remarks by saying the obvious. The first 16 or so weeks of 2024 haven't been a lot of fun for REIT investors. It's not clear at this point when the marketplace will recognize what we believe to be the total return value that REITs can and do represent at this point.\nMost, not all, but most REIT categories currently offer dividend yields that are materially in excess of current inflation rates. And REIT dividends, unlike money market or bond interest payments have the potential to grow over time as VICI says with VICI posting a dividend growth CAGR of 7.9% since the first quarter of 2018 following our IPO.\nWe've been living through a period in the equity marketplace in which the power of compounding has been somewhat ignored or forgotten. REITs can be powerful compounding tools. As a VICI shareholder, I haven't forgotten or ignored that compounding dynamic can benefit. I look forward to answering your questions, but first, a few words from John and David. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Relationships are at the core of what we do at VICI and the quality of the relationships we have sets us apart. Our team works hard to strengthen existing ones and develop new ones so that we are best positioned for future growth opportunities, whether or not we are invited to what Ed is called The party.\nOur focus on trust in finding mutually beneficial solutions with our partners multiplies the beneficial impact of each relationship and we believe lays the groundwork for future growth through both good and bad market environments. One of the best examples of this is our relationship with Apollo and the team at the Venetian. The opportunity to acquire the Venetian originated during the COVID pandemic, another period of uncertainty with a challenging market backdrop.\nSince that time, the team at the Venetian has outperformed all expectations as Las Vegas has continued solidify itself as the entertainment center of the world. We are thrilled to further expand our close relationship with Apollo and announced our opportunity to invest up to $700 million at the Venetian through VICI's Partner Property Growth Fund. This capital investment will fund several projects that seek to improve the overall guest experience and enhance the value of the property.\nThe impact of our increasingly dynamic Las Vegas has continued to accrue to the benefit of the Venetian since we acquired the property together with Apollo in 2022, particularly with the neighboring sphere events like F1 and Super Bowl and an active convention schedule. The Venetian is set to celebrate its 25th anniversary this Saturday, and we're thrilled to partner with Apollo once again in their efforts to maximize the economic potential of this amazing iconic script asset.\nGaming remains at VICI's core with over 98% of rent coming from our gaming partners, and the sector remains broadly healthy from a tenant credit perspective. Las Vegas continues to enjoy healthy growth with GGR up low single digits following the Super Bowl this quarter, and that is on top of an already impressive baseline, given gaming revenue increased 12% in the first quarter of 2023 over 2022.\nSince the market emerged from the pandemic, there has been 12 straight quarters. I'm going to repeat that. There has been 12 straight quarters of GGR growth in Las Vegas. Additionally, Las Vegas visitation numbers were up 4.2% in the first quarter, demonstrating the continued diversity of the revenue streams and the vast array of consumers enjoying this amazing city.\nIn fact, based on a recent study from the University of Toronto, that evaluated North American cities pre and post pandemic, Las Vegas is the only city that has surpassed pre-pandemic unique visitation numbers. In the regional gaming markets, while we recognize idiosyncratic weather headwinds this winter, we believe fundamentals remain sound, and we see steady consumer discretionary spend driven by the middle and high-end consumers on the casino floor.\nAlthough interest rate volatility has impacted transaction volume in the gaming market, we are active in dialogue around real estate opportunities in the gaming sector. Outside of our embedded growth pipeline, our relationships and gaming focus put us in a strong position when transactions or opportunities to invest in our existing properties arise.\nWe continue to monitor the performance of Harris Horse [indiscernible] Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis, for which we have a call right to acquire the real estate and buildings of these unique assets. This call right expires at the end of 2024 and we continue to work through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies to gain the necessary gaming approvals should we elect to execute this option.\nVICI is also well positioned for incremental opportunities outside the gaming space as we've continued to expand our scope and our TAM of investments. We are committed to ensuring that each experiential sector and potential partner meets our investment criteria of low cyclicality, low secular threat, improving track record of growth and favorable supply and demand dynamics.\nIn January of this year, VICI expanded investment in the youth sports sector, with the announcement of the up to $105 million construction loan agreement with affiliates of Home field, Kansas City to fund the development of a Margaritaville resort that will be embedded within Home field's broader youth sports complex.\nThe use sports training center hosted 115 teams this last weekend for a basketball tournament and the baseball facility is open and in use. The Margaritaville resort is expected to be completed in 2025. Having visited the area a few weeks ago, I can tell you all the facilities are truly amazing.\nThe home field partnership adds to our eSports investment, as Ed said, which we initiated with our 2020 mortgage loan to Chelsea Piers in New York City. And at the end of 2023, we acquired the leasehold interest in the property and converted the initial loan into real estate ownership.\nWhile reach were broadly excluded from this output at the party that took place in the first quarter of 2024. The effects of the transactions and relationships announced at the end of last year and the beginning of this year contributed to our 6.1% growth in AFFO per share. As I stated earlier, our relationships are at the foundation of our business and drive our growth.\nOur standard for prudent underwriting gives us confidence in our roster of existing partners with whom we believe we have many growth opportunities. We look forward to developing new relationships with best-in-class operators so that VICI can continue to grow its quality experiential real estate portfolio. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we greatly appreciate your time. Starting with our balance sheet, as Ed mentioned, in the first quarter, we successfully -- I'll say, very successfully executed our first refinancing of the $1.50 billion May 2024 notes that came -- that would have come due yesterday.\nOn March 7, we launched a bond offering and at its peak, we are 12x oversubscribed. We ultimately issued $550 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 5.75% and $500 million of 30-year notes at a coupon of 6.25% for a blended yield of 5.9% before the impact of our forward interest rate swaps.\nWhen compared to the coupon of 5.625% that we refinanced, we feel really good about the all-in coupon we were able to achieve and at the same time, extend the duration of our maturity profile. During the quarter, we also bolstered our liquidity and sold 9.7 million shares, raising $305 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward.\nCurrently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $515 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, $683 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we sit here today, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current macro environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital.\nIn terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized first quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.4x within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.8 years to maturity.\nTouching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.56 for the quarter, an increase of 6.1% compared to the $0.53 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $16.2 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7% and continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs.\nTurning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we originally highlighted on our Q4 earnings call, AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, is expected to be between $2.32 billion and $2.355 billion or between $2.22 and $2.25 per diluted common share.\nAs a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not yet closed, interest income from any loans that do not have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items.\nAnd as we have previously mentioned, we recorded noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy.\nAccordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused, and we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 23, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning.

Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start this morning with a few words about 2023 VICI accomplishments and the way forward. John Payne will share our 2024 growth approach, and David Kieske will discuss our 2023 financial results and our 2024 guidance.\nLast night, we announced final 2023 AFFO per share of $2.15, representing year-over-year per share growth of 11.8%. VICI's 2023 AFFO growth will likely make VICI 1 of the 2023 income growth leaders among the 29 S&P 500 REITs that report AFFO per share. There are 30 S&P 500 REITs overall, representing approximately 90% of the U.S. REIT equity market capitalization at year-end.\nVICI's 2023 growth is largely the result of work we did in 2022, forging new relationships and new investments in both gaming and on -- both property acquisitions and property credit investments. I'm proud of our 2023 AFFO per share growth but I'm also proud of what the VICI team did in 2023 to continue to produce growth for 2024 and beyond. Our investment activities in 2023 produced growth in our portfolio quality, geographic diversity, tenant diversity and income. Indeed, when it comes to 2024 income growth, as David will discuss in a moment regarding our 2024 guidance, we expect our projected 2024 AFFO per share growth should put VICI well into the top half of the S&P 500 REIT 2024 AFFO per share growth table.\nIt wasn't easy to produce future growth in 2023. It was tough to navigate in 2023. Most days in 2023 and frankly, most days in 2024 and so far, remind me of my days living and working in Whistler, British Columbia, where a very challenging coastal mountain environment could result in days so foggy and whited out that we describe such days as skiing inside a milk model. But even amidst this low visibility, the VICI team kept pioneering in 2023. We invested in new geographies, including 3 new countries and through our Valero acquisition in U.S. noncommercial gaming states such as Texas, California and North Carolina.\nWe invested in new categories such as family recreation and youth sports. We expanded our partnerships with Kilgermi's brands like Cabot and Canyon Ranch. We acquired the primary leasehold interest in New York's in comparable Chelsea Piers through our position as the leading owner of real estate on the Las Vegas Strip. We continue to work with our Las Vegas partners to capitalize on Las Vegas' leadership position in global entertainment and hospitality. I strongly believe VG's investment in Las Vegas is one of the most compelling investments in the current global commercial real estate investing landscape, period, full stop.\nAs we set out in our earnings release last night, in 2023, we announced and closed $1.8 billion of capital acquisitions and investments within the year. Note that these figures do not include the $2.8 billion closing of our Mandalay Bay MGM Grand joint venture in early January 2023, which we announced in early December 2022, including our assumption of the remaining $1.5 billion of CMBS debt.\nA fundamental importance our 2023 investing in gaming and nongaming was accretive. Our announced 2023 capital investments were made at a blended initial unlevered investment yield of 7.7%. Our 2023 investing was also balance sheet enhancing. We funded this $1.8 billion of investment with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and equity and only about $200 million of incremental debt. achieving an equity to debt funding ratio on that investment activity of 8:1, demonstrating our commitment to our long-range net leverage target of 5.0 to 5.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nAs we look ahead within 2024, despite the continued cloudy macroeconomic conditions and outlook we begin 2024 with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and forward equity resources to deploy into continuing accretive growth. Needless to say, in the macro environment of constrained capital conditions, we believe our capital resources can and will be attractive to gaming and experiential operators who want to grow and/or need liquidity.\nFinally, in 2024, we will continue to build a portfolio of quality. You've heard me say before that I believe VICI is the pioneer in bringing Class A real estate to net lease. By Class A, we mean real estate of great scale, great quality and high mission criticality. And VICI enables investors to own Class A real estate within the strong economic transparency and integrity of the net lease model. What we can, must and will do is continue to enable existing and potential VICI investors to understand fully scale, quality and mission criticality of our Class A real estate.\nTo that end, we are proud to announce that we're launching today the VICI Properties photo book, a digital coffee table style book that brings to life the magnificence of the real estate owned by VICI. You can view this book online at our website, www.viciproperties.com. And I thank [ Hays Honey ] of our team for her great work in producing and publishing this book. I strongly encourage you to give this book a good feeling. If you're a VC shareholder, I believe the book will give you great pride in what you own.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. In 2023, VICI was able to navigate a volatile broader market backdrop, particularly for REIT and consistently deploy capital in accretive manners throughout the year. Over the course of 2023, we deployed $1.8 billion at a blended yield of approximately 7.7% and across investments that expanded our geographic reach domestically and internationally, broaden our investable universe across gaming, hospitality and family entertainment and deepen our ability to invest creatively through property-related credit investments.\nOur ability to transact successfully last year was due in part to the multiyear effort I've mentioned before on our earnings calls. Every day at VICI, our team shows up for work and focuses on developing and maintaining relationships with best-in-class growth-oriented operators. While some REITs describes themselves simply as a landlord and position themselves to extract value from their tenants. We view ourselves as a long-term capital partner collaborating with our tenants to create value.\nThis philosophy of serving as a capital partner and prioritizing relationships with operators who pursue growth energetically serves as our compass as we assess and underwrite opportunities in the current environment. an environment that is characterized by low visibility and fluctuating cost of capital. To that end, many of you have heard me speak over the years about our focus on growth. And it's also important to understand that there have been numerous situations in which we elect to not pursue opportunities.\nVICI is in the very fortunate position to have created significant shareholder value over the years. For example, we've grown our AFFO per share at an 8.5% CAGR from 2018 through 2023, while our dividend has grown at a comparable high single-digit rate, and we do not believe we need to pursue growth purely for the sake of growing.\nFor those of you who may be newer to our story, I would like to touch on a few elements of our growth pillars that have allowed us to successfully complete $36 billion of accretive transaction volume in a little over 6 years. Number one, we work collaborate with operating partners investing in growth opportunities and funding high ROI capital projects in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Number two, as the only S&P 500 REIT predominantly invested in the gaming industry, given 90% of our rent roll is derived from gaming investments, our team travels far and wide, visiting properties, studying new markets, assessing the landscape and meeting with operators across regional, Las Vegas and even international locations.\nNumber three, we are supplementing our gaming investments with opportunities in experiential sectors that we believe are positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds. We focus on sourcing transactions with operators who position themselves for growth, including through roll-up in an industry, much as you saw with our Cabot and Valero transactions announced in October of last year.\nAnd finally, number four, we constantly keep our eyes open for opportunities where VICI can get better by getting bigger as demonstrated through the acquisition of MGM Growth Properties in 2022, which significantly expanded our footprint in Las Vegas, added Class A market-leading regional assets to our portfolio, improved our balance sheet to investment-grade and has positioned us for a long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, a world-class gaming, hospitality and leisure operator.\nAs we dive further into 2024, we hold firm at the criteria that has driven much of our track record to date while executing across our strategic pillars. In particular, we are adhering to prudent underwriting standards, ensuring your capital is appropriately compensated as we assess risk and pursue opportunities across different properties, markets and asset classes.\nAnd as I said earlier, we maintain a preference for growth-focused operators with our entire team evaluating a partner's track record and importantly, their use of proceeds, which typically explains intentions time pursuing the transaction. We ultimately believe the right partnerships lead to the right opportunities, which feeds the flywheel value creation through collaboration.\nWe believe our commitment to developing and deepening relationship with great operators of all shapes and sizes, combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will afford us the ability to continue to executing accretive deals during time when other REITs may be stuck \"skiing inside a milk bottle.\"\nNow I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we appreciate your time. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2023 exemplifies the continued discipline we have maintained over 6-plus years of existence by ensuring that we allocate capital accretively, have a balance sheet and liquidity profile designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection of our equity and credit partners deserve.\nDuring the year, we raised over $1.6 billion in forward equity. In January of 2023, we raised approximately $1 billion in gross forward equity proceeds at a $33 price per share. Those proceeds were used throughout the year to accretively fund our transactions. We utilized our ATM program throughout 2023, raising $643 million in gross forward proceeds. That amount includes $390 million, which was raised in Q4 through the sale of 13.2 million shares via the forward and remains outstanding today.\nAnd subsequent to year-end, in Q1 2024, we sold 9.7 million shares raising $306 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. This brings our total outstanding forward equity to just under $700 million, bolstering our overall liquidity. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $523 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, $696 million of proceeds under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we begin 2024, we believe we are extremely well positioned to navigate the current environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital as we sit here today. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA annualized for a full year of activity from our recent acquisitions and excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.5x within our target leverage range.\nWe have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35%, taking into account our hedge portfolio that we utilized in connection with our April 2022 inaugural investment-grade offering and a weighted average of 5.9 years to maturity. As of December 31, we've entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements ahead of our May 1 $1.05 billion bond maturity, which has an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. This portfolio has an effective treasury rate of 4.04%.\nJust touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 8.8% compared to $0.51 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, For the full year 2023, AFFO per share was $2.15, an increase of 11.8% compared to $1.93 for the full year 2022 and as Ed mentioned, making VICI one of the leaders across the S&P 500 REITs.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15.3 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%. this continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs.\nTurning to our guidance. And as you saw in our release last night, we are initiating AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, is expected to be between $2.32 billion and $2.355 billion or between $2.22 per share and $2.25 per share. Based on the midpoint of our '24 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4%, a very attractive starting point as we begin 2024.\nAnd just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other nonrecurring transaction or items. And as we've mentioned previously, we recorded noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 26, 2023.\nI'll now turn the call over to Samantha Callagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC.\nFor additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today is Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Louie McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2023 is a quarter most REITs are happy to be done with. The REIT index in Q3 2023 was down 8%, swinging negative for the year after not a great year last year, and October has only continued a negative trend. But while the REIT stock marketplace didn't have a great quarter in Q3 2023, the key question to ask is what a given REIT did in Q3 and now in October to improve its business for the future.\nAt VICI, our answer to this question has a number of elements to it. We played offense selectively. We played defense. We capitalized on certain current conditions we prepared for potential future conditions. We increased our dividend effective with Q3 2023 and an annualized rate that well exceeds forward inflation expectations and continued rate of dividend growth since 2019 and that is 3x greater than the largest net lease REIT over the same period. And if there has ever been a period in which 1 should value a solidly covered and solidly growing dividend, that currently exceeds the 10-year rate. This is it.\nFinally, in a year in which REIT earnings growth has generally been difficult to come by, VICI's AFFO per share earnings in Q3 grew 10.7% year-over-year. VICI announced within and subsequent to quarter end, about $1.1 billion of new capital commitments. While most of you have seen the strategic and economic merits of these investments, we know there are some of you who feel that we should have left that capital in a stockpile. Some of you feel understandably that volatility is too high and visibility is too low. We agree volatility is high and visibility is low. And with the market movements of especially the last few weeks, we are sober and cautious about what the market conditions for capital allocation could be from here for how long, no one knows.\nBut I can tell you that we continue to have high conviction about the commitments we've recently made with Century, with Canyon Ranch and now with Valero. These commitments represented immediately accretive investments in real estate that should have positive impacts on 2024 earnings. These commitments also represent investments in relationships that can and will be the answer in future years to, okay, now that things are back to normal, how are you going to grow, VICI. Again, none of us know when the all-clear signal will sound, but it will in some way and REITs that continue to invest in relationships we'll be best positioned to resume growing when market conditions and values have stabilized. That's what we at VICI did in the recovery out of COVID. Our situational readiness put us in the position to acquire the Venetian and MGP, investments that are a key driver of our 2023 earnings growth, and we made these investments and many other would be made [indiscernible] been fully readying themselves for recovery.\nWe have been able to undertake our recent investments because of the astute and agile work of [indiscernible] McCluskey and the VICI Capital Markets team. Going back to our nearly $1 billion overnight equity raise in early January 2023, VICI has opportunistically raised a total of approximately $1.3 billion of forward equity in 2023, giving VICI a cost of funds for our recent investments to drive the immediate accretion of which we've spoken.\nWe also made defense this past quarter. During Q3 and subsequent to quarter end, we played defense by using close to $1 billion of equity in cash and only about $55 million of debt to fund our new capital commitments demonstrating our commitment to our long-range leverage targets. David Kieske and the VICI Finance team also played defense by adding a further $200 million of swap protection since Q2 in anticipation of our 2024 refinancing of $1.05 billion of the legacy MGP [ 5/8 ] notes giving us a total of $450 million of swap protection. And while we did all this, our tenants continue to demonstrate the vitality of their businesses as John will speak of momentarily. I'm very proud of the work the entire VICI team did this quarter against a volatile and difficult backdrop, the VICI team working within 1 of the lightest G&A loads of any S&P 500 REIT continue to create a culture of excellence and resilience that I'm confident will serve VICI's stakeholders well for years to come no matter what those years bring.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Payne for an operating and transaction marketplace update, and John will then pass the mic to David Kieske, who will give our financial and guidance update. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. While 2023 has been a volatile year in the real estate sector, as Ed just highlighted, we at VICI have put ourselves in the position on both a capital and relationship basis to not only continue our business but to expand it into new sectors, new relationships and new geographies. In the third quarter, we continued to grow with our partners at Century Casinos by closing our Rocky Gap Casino Resort acquisition in Maryland, our sale leaseback of 4 gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, growing our international footprint.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we were very excited to announce our entry into the family entertainment sector, through our acquisition of 38 bowling entertainment centers with our new partners at Valero, led by Tom Shannon and Brett Parker, the Valero team is a perfect example of a talented growth-minded operator that has a deep understanding of their consumer recreational trends and the value that a VICI relationship and our capital can bring to their growth strategies. VICI's tenants are not only continuing to show strong operating results, but are also continuing to invest in capital improvements all over the United States. Caesars is investing over $400 million into just 1 asset, Harrah's New Orleans. The Venetian just announced a $1 billion plan to further enhance our asset including almost $200 million in just convention center space. MGM spends hundreds of millions of dollars in CapEx each year on assets throughout Las Vegas and the regional markets. And even our smallest operators are investing millions of dollars each year on growth projects, thereby enhancing the quality of our assets and the productivity of their operating businesses. These reinvestment commitments add to our conviction that we are continuing to construct a high-quality portfolio of assets with the best experiential operators for our investors.\nThis high-quality classification comes from not only the quality of the real estate itself, but also from the outsized productivity of these assets. productivity that is hard to come by in almost any other real estate sector. No place highlights the health and productivity of our tenants better than Las Vegas. After meeting with Caesar's CEO, Tom Reeg at G2E, which is the largest gaming conference in the United States, one analyst noted that Caesars is on pace for its best October ever. And this is against the backdrop of current macroeconomic uncertainty. Even during these tough times, Las Vegas continues to open new world-class attractions while diversifying its revenue stream and customer base. The opening of the [ must-see ] entertainment venue, the sphere world famous events like Formula 1 and the 2024 Super Bowl and a diverse and robust convention and conference schedule all helped showcase that there's no city performing like Las Vegas, that has clearly become the entertainment epicenter of the world.\nOutside of Las Vegas, regional performance has continued to be resilient, while many operators in our discussions have cited increased expenses related to items such as insurance or unrated play normalizing against tough comps, regional operations continue to run at very strong profit levels supported by loyal consumers with their respective database. Strategically, we continue to be focused on all fronts: gaming, nongaming, domestic and international to grow our pipeline for VICI's future. In gaming, Danny Valoy and I are in constant dialogue with new potential partners domestically and internationally, and we are just as excited by the ways we can potentially help our current tenants grow through additional tuck-in acquisitions or by utilizing our partner property growth fund in which we seek to fund our tenants high ROI opportunities at our existing assets. Meanwhile, Kellen Floral has been cultivating invaluable connections and relationships across the family entertainment, sport, wellness, leisure and recreation sectors as we continue pursuing our mission to be the real estate capital partner of choice to best-in-class growth minding operators of unique social infrastructure properties.\nDuring this most challenging time of market volatility for everyone, it is more important than ever for our team to continue to grow and deepen our networks and to grow our breadth of opportunities to best position for the years to come. This work is intended to position us to continue to deliver the growth our shareholders have come to expect from the VICI team.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today. The VICI team takes pride in what we've accomplished in 2023, acknowledging the year is not over, but the results we posted last night and last week's Bowlero announcement are exemplary of those accomplishments, as Ed said, we are improving the business, which should benefit VICI and you as shareholders as to 2024 and beyond. Highlighting the transaction we closed last week with Bowlero and we have spoken to many of you about, the deal was immediately accretive to our AFFO given we had prepared by raising forward equity for the transaction many months earlier generating an attractive spread to that cost of capital. From an economic standpoint, the deal is very attractive. But as John mentioned, it also builds a partnership with a market leader that we and the Bowlero team believe will grow together in the future. Subsequent to funding this transaction, we have approximately $3 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $430 million in cash, $250 million of estimated net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility.\nIn terms of net leverage, net debt to annualized Q3 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% accounting for our hedge portfolio and a weighted average of 6.1 years to maturity. Then as we prepare for our first bond refinancing in early 2024, we have entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $450 million to date. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 11% compared to $0.49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $14.4 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, 1 of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share or $1.66 on an annualized basis, representing a 6.4% year-over-year increase. Then turning to guidance. we are updating and increasing AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.18 billion or between $2.14 and $2.15 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11%, one of the highest expected growth rates across all REITs. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transaction items. And as a reminder, we do record a noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, Elliott, please open the line for questions."

A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our second quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC.\nHosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets, and and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk this morning about our Q2 2023 results featuring a year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11.9%, which we believe will be among the higher growth rates for S&P 500 REITs for Q2 2023, and yet at one of the lowest price to earnings growth ratios, PEG or PEG plus yield ratios among the S&P 500 REITs. For the course of the call, John will share with you what we're doing strategically to continue our growth, and David will give you details on our liquidity position, our Q2 2023 results and our updated earnings outlook to year-end.\nI will now spend a few minutes on the exciting news we shared last night with the announcement of our significantly expanded growth partnership with Canyon Ranch, a legendary and leading brand in the place-based wellness sector. Indeed, I'm excited to say that the VICI team is conducting this call from Canyon Ranch Lennox in the beautiful Berkshires in Massachusetts. The key elements of our expanded Canyon Ranch partnership are BG making an up to $150 million preferred equity investment in the Canyon Ranch operating company to support the expansion of the Canyon Ranch operating and digital platforms as well as enhancements to the Tucson and Lenox assets. VICI also intends to provide approximately $150 million of mortgage financing secured by Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox to refinance Canyon Ranch's existing CMBS debt. With this refinancing serving as a bridge to enhancing VICI's embedded growth pipeline by specifically allowing for VICI's conversion of its existing purchase options on Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox, which are converting to call rights, whereby VICI can elect to acquire the real estate assets of Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox in the coming years, subject to certain conditions, with Canyon Ranch continuing to operate the assets under long-term triple net leases. This also includes VICI's previously announced commitment to provide up to $200 million of development funding for Canyon Ranch Austin, which is scheduled to open between 2025 and 2026 with a call right to own the real estate upon stabilization. And finally, the joint development of a strategy of identifying and potentially acquiring conventional resorts that have conversion potential to new Canyon Ranch resorts with Canyon Ranch operating the resorts and VICI owning the resort real estate under a long-term triple net lease.\nCanyon Ranch has nearly 45 years of operating history. It serves a highly affluent clientele that invest vigorously through all cycles in medical and holistic life enhancement experiences and services. With only 2 established destination resort locations, we believe Canyon Ranch is positioned to significantly expand its clientele and its geography domestically and internationally. We are investing in Canyon Ranch to help fund and energize that expansion gaining through our partnership the opportunity to fund the acquisition and integration of new Canyon Ranch Resorts. Under the leadership of CEO, Jeff Kuster, the Canyon Ranch team is poised to grow its brand reach and network breadth, both programmatically and geographically. And of all the elements of our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch, John Goff, Canyon Ranch's [indiscernible] and I are most excited about network expansion in the years ahead. Both John Goff and I believe that the conventional resort sector could see elements of distress in the next few years, less to do with operating performance and more to do with refinancing constriction.\nAs we have pointed out in our transaction deck, which can be found at www.viciproperties.com, more than $37 billion of resort and hotel CMBS financing will come due from 2024 through 2028. And I should point out that, that's only a fraction of the overall mortgage financing on U.S. hotels and resorts during this period. We believe that within those billions of dollars, our resorts that could meet Canon Ranch's conversion criteria.\nThe conversion of a conventional resort to a Canyon Ranch Resort has the potential to be transformative thanks to the capital and operating dynamics of the Canyon Ranch economic model. The Canyon Ranch model centers on maximizing the guest experience of space, indoors and out, and maximizing the guest experience of time through Canyon Ranch's holistic wellness and life enhancement offerings. This maximization of experiences leads to a revenue intensity within the Canyon Ranch model that surpasses the economic intensity of a conventional resort, potentially giving Canyon Ranch and VICI competitive advantage in acquiring and realizing value out of resort locations meeting our criteria. I believe our growth opportunity with Canyon Ranch is a generational opportunity in multiple senses of generational. Wellness is a secular growth trend that is multigenerational in its consumer profile and generational in terms of its secular outlook and growth opportunity. And Canyon Ranch Resorts are real estate built to last for generations.\nAt VICI, we invest in partnerships and real estate assets that will preserve and grow value for many generations to come. As you look across the spectrum of S&P 500 REITs, ask yourself is the real estate of high-quality and generational durability? And does the real estate enjoy the benefit of cultural and demographic tailwinds that will sustain and grow the value of the real estate for generations come? With VICI, I believe you get high-quality enduring real estate occupied by operators serving multiple generations of customers for generations to come. We believe our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch is a superb example of this value proposition.\nWith that, over to you, John Payne.\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Ed makes an excellent point on the quality enduring aspects of VICI's portfolio. Our tenants continue to prove their operational excellence and their ability to innovate and evolve their business. And importantly, for VICI, their assets as well. The results that continue to come out of Las Vegas speak to our tenants' operational quality and the operating credit, which we believe accrues to the value of our real estate. I will touch on Las Vegas in the gaming sector shortly. But I wanted to emphasize the type of portfolio we have built and that the team continues to build at VICI. These characteristics are a core focus of our strategy as we meet potential partners in gaming and nongaming experiential sectors, both domestically and internationally.\nTo recap our second quarter and subsequent activity, VICI continued its international expansion into Canada with our announcement of the acquisition of 4 gaming assets from Century Casino in Alberta. We also closed on the acquisition of the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Maryland this week, again with Century Casinos. Our partnership with Century is a great example of the type of operators we look for as the relationship is a win-win for both businesses as we grow together. Canyon Ranch also exemplifies the type of growth-minded partner with operational excellence and place-based wellness. As as described earlier, we are very excited to deepen and expand the relationship into the future.\nGrowing with our partners as they look to enhance and expand their businesses is a core component of our strategy as we develop and deepen our relationships across gaming and the non-gaming sectors. This approach helps VICI continue to grow a more visible pipeline into our future with operators we value and we trust. It also allows VICI to build a portfolio of assets with each partner that we believe can meaningfully impact VICI's growth over time. In the gaming sector, we continue to be impressed by our tenants. They exemplify the operational excellence we seek to find as we expand into other sectors. In what other sector right now, can you find a headline that reads \"Another all-time record result, but in line with consensus.\" Las Vegas has remained at or near all-time highs in terms of margins and results and is continuing to see record traffic. Regional casinos are performing well as the high-value consumer segment remains quite healthy. We continue to see many domestic real estate opportunities in gaming, including in markets where we do not currently own assets and as the industry expands its footprint into new areas of the United States. We also remain focused on international opportunities with the team traveling the globe this year, meeting new potential partners. As VICI's brand has ascended the funnel of opportunities has expanded in both gaming and non-gaming. We've added resources to meet the expanded funnel of opportunities. And as always, we work closely with our advisers and those in the VICI network to help force multiply our ability to create and evaluate opportunities.\nFor nongaming, we are intensely studying various sectors at a category level and operating level and at an asset level. Notably, in the family entertainment and sports categories, we're moving past the evaluation stage and into constructive discussions on how VICI's capital can fit best with our growing relationships. As you know, our relationships at VICI are at the heart of our success, and they take time to cultivate as we aim to find the best solutions that meet the goals of both sides, especially in an ever-evolving economic and capital markets environment. We're excited about how these relationships are developing.\nThe VICI team has been hard at work this year, building relationships and opportunities for a pipeline of growth across multiple sectors and geographies in the years to come. We are focused on partnering with best-in-class growth-minded operators with whom VICI can continue to grow our high-quality and generational real estate portfolio. We worked tirelessly to deliver results to our shareholders, evidenced by the last 5.5 years.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll keep my remarks brief as we want to leave as much time for everyone's questions, but I do want to touch on our liquidity and our updated full year guidance. We are constantly focusing and at times obsessing on the balance sheet as we work to bring our leverage back down to our target range of 5 to 5.5x, while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our shareholders. We are diligently working with the agencies to improve our credit ratings over time, lower our cost of capital while balancing the right leverage for the company.\nAt quarter end, we had approximately $4 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $740 million in cash, $870 million of net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we settled approximately $190 million in shares under our forward sale agreements to fund the closing of Rocky Gap.\nIn terms of leverage, net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.6x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.4 years to maturity.\nTurning to the income statement. AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 12% compared to $0.48 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.\nTurning to guidance. We are updating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.13 billion and $2.16 billion or between $2.11 and $2.14 per diluted common share. Just to reiterate, based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 10%, one of the highest growth rates across REIT brands.\nAnd as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we've discussed with you in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused and -- as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the product -- productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 2, 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nSecretary, Executive Vice President & General Counsel, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are which are usually identified by use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions.\nDuring the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2023 earnings release for supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties, please refer to the respective company's public filings at the SEC.\nHosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Lara Makoske, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today by telling you how I tend to spend my Saturday mornings espresso in hand. First, I grab the FT, the old-fashioned print edition, to see what Katie Martin has to say about the state of the equity and credit markets in her Long View column.\nKatie can be very funny. But the long and short of it is that the market participants she's quoting these days aren't having a lot of fun. Then I might grab my iPad and catch up on any of Rob Armstrong's unhedged FT columns that I fell behind on during the prior week.\nRob's response to current and prospective market conditions is rather Hamlet in character: to be or not to be, to be a bull or to be a bear or to be neither. But who is he who is neither bull nor bear? That is the question.\nIn my second espresso, I might see with the 2 Michaels and 1 Marco, among others, have had to offer a market commentary and forecasting in the prior few days, Hartnett, Wilson, Kolonovic. I could call them the 3 archdukes of doom, but that would be unfair. Well, actually not that unfair. And if these folks are formulating a rational response to the current state of the macro economy, monetary and fiscal policy and the markets. Visibility is low. Uncertainty is high.\nIn commercial real estate, asset pricing is murky and/or subject to dispute between would be sellers and would be buyers. As a result, there's not a whole lot of trading going on. Commercial real estate trading was down nearly 70% year-over-year in March 2023. And it's not like March 2022 was a barn burner for real estate assets or portfolio trading.\nWhat does all this uncertainty and low visibility mean for how we're thinking and what we're doing at VICI? Our thinking in doing starts with our current state of earnings growth and investment activity. As you saw on last night's VICI earnings release, for Q1 2023, we generated year-over-year AFFO growth of 18.6% per share, a rate that we believe will be among the highest for REITs generally and S&P 500 REITs specifically.\nAnd to take a broader view, so far in earnings season, year-over-year Q1 2023 earnings growth for S&P 500 companies of all kinds is running at negative 4% versus VICI's Q1 AFFO growth again at 18.6%. But it's not only about growth in current earnings, it's about growing our future earnings.\nAlong that line and even amidst this murky trading environment, within Q1, we allocated a total of $1.6 billion of incremental capital to compelling and accretive experiential property and lending investments, which John will have more detail on in a moment. And even with that $1.6 billion of capital having been newly allocated in Q1, we have approximately $859 million of equity dry powder, thanks to our unsettled forward equity and approximately $650 million in cash.\nCombined that with $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, and we have the funding in place to seize on further opportunity if opportunity presents itself in this current environment. Most of all, during an uncertain time like this, we keep doing what we've done at VICI in the beginning. We are always working on our future, growing relationships that have the potential to grow our business. These relationships don't have to turn into deals tomorrow, as John has noted in the past.\nIn that vein, think about the fact that the AFFO growth VICI expects to reduce in 2023 is in good measure the result of relationship building we did many years ago with those who would end up being our partners in our Venetian and MGP transaction, which we announced in 2021. Thus, it is, to reiterate, that much of the work we are doing at VICI in 2023 is about growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond.\nAnd yet I don't mean to suggest that we are not jumping on immediate opportunities when these opportunities are compelling, as evidenced again by the $1.6 billion of capital we newly deployed in Q1 2023.\nFinally, we are working intensely in the present and for our future with one of the lowest G&A loads in American triple net REIT management as a percentage of revenues or of assets. Think of our G&A as a form of asset management theme. Our asset management fee understood in this way, as measured by VICI corporate G&A, runs at about 0.1% of assets under management. That's a fee load you would expect from a passive manager of an index fund. With VICI for 0.1%, you get very active investment management that has historically produced significant outperformance.\nI'll now turn the call to John so that he can share with you what kind of activities we have been up to and are up to. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & Chief Operations Officer, VICI Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. Ed quoted Shakespeare's Hamlet when describing current market conditions. So I thought it would be appropriate to quote another great, Ted Lasso, when describing how the VICI team has functioned through the last 5 years of a rather volatile market. Lasso said, \"the harder you work, the luckier you get.\"\nWe saw the results of that work come together in 2022, which was a transformational year for VICI in which we doubled our size and scale, becoming one of the largest triple net REITs.\n2023, as Ed just noted, is the year in which we are laying the groundwork for VICI's next phase of expansion domestically and globally across gaming and many other experiential sectors. In the first quarter, VICI closed on its first international transaction with pure Canadian gaming in Alberta, Canada, one of Canada's top gaming markets. We are thrilled that our first international transaction was in Canada as we believe the Canadian gaming industry presents a great opportunity for VICI as it is an established industry with many similarities to the U.S. gaming industry.\nThis transaction will be the first of many international investments that the VICI team continues to explore across the globe. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% stake in our Mandalay Bay MGM Grand joint venture with Blackstone. This real estate consolidation was a great example of our high functioning partnership with Blackstone as we both accomplished important goals with this transaction, and VICI now owns 100% of 2 additional Class A resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.\nTo spend a moment on Las Vegas. In February, over 4 million people traveled through Harry Reid Airport for the first time ever, which is 25% above February of 2022. Our operating partners continue to set all-time records and volumes in all segments continue to remain strong. Our operating partners continue to see very strong hotel occupancy and are also experiencing a nice recovery in the group and convention business. These strong operating numbers are the result of tremendous innovation and capital deployment by our tenants and their work is making Las Vegas the gaming, sports and entertainment capital of the world.\nWe're also proud to expand our relationship with Travel Nations, adding Cherokee Nation businesses of Oklahoma to our tenant roster as they enter into the lease agreement related to the Gold Strike Casino and Resort in Tunica, Mississippi. We are also supporting our partners at Hard Rock in the redevelopment of Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada by purchasing a portion of the senior secured notes funding this exciting new project.\nThe American tribal nations are some of the best gaming operators, and we look forward to continue to find ways to help support their growth as they expand in the commercial gaming across the country.\nWithin nongaming experiential industries, the team is intensely studying sectors we believe fit well with our VICI Properties investment criteria. We continue to meet and build relationship with owners and operators in many sectors, including health and wellness, youth, collegiate and professional sports, various forms of family entertainment, theme parks, holiday parks and other destination-based experiences.\nThe team is forging foundational relationships with the market leaders who have ambitions to grow and see VICI as a preferred capital partner for their businesses, similar to those we helped, Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch. For this quarter, we expanded our indoor water park presence with our fourth loan to Great Wolf Lodge to fund the development of their location in Connecticut and in partnership with the Foxwoods Resort.\nThe VICI team will make the most of this year by continuing to build a pipeline of partnerships that we believe will help us achieve our future growth goals, while at the same time expecting to deliver at least 10% of AFFO per share growth in 2023. As you've observed over the past 5 years, our team does not rest very often as we're laser-focused on building the highest quality experiential REIT in the world.\nNow I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. 2023 started off with several very exciting transactions. Our ability to move quickly and close these acquisitions at the start of the year as a result of the liquidity we have maintained and balance sheet that we have built over the years in an effort to be nimble and act on attractive opportunities as they come before us.\nWe will continue to focus on the balance sheet as it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve.\nAs John mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the 4 Pure Canadian gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, the 49.9% interest we previously did not own in the MGM Grand Mandalay Bay JV. And we purchased $85 million of senior secured notes issued by Hard Rock Ottawa LP. This is an exciting transaction for VICI as we partnered with a large financial institution to provide Hard Rock with a complete financing solution for the redevelopment of what will become the Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada.\nIn addition, we announced a $287.9 million construction loan for the development of a Great Wolf Lodge, which sits on land owned by the Mashantucket Pequot tribal nation next to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. This transaction represents our fourth loan with Great Wolf for a total capital commitment of approximately $550 million to support Great Wolf's development pipeline.\nIn January, we bolstered our liquidity raising approximately $965 million of available net equity proceeds through the sale of 30.3 million shares via forward sale agreements. On April 4, we physically settled 3.2 million of these shares for net proceeds of approximately $101.5 million. As we sit here today, we have approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity. As Ed mentioned, this is comprised of approximately $650 million in cash, $859 million of net proceeds available from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility.\nIn terms of the leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x today. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity.\nTurning to the income statement. AFFO was $528.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 73% over Q1 2022. AFFO per share was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% compared to the $0.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. As a reminder, the disparity between our overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from equity raised and shares issued to fund our acquisition of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay JV this quarter and to consummate our acquisitions of MGP during Q2 and the Venetian resort during Q1 of last year.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.\nTurning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.\nAs a reminder, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability, leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, Elliott, please open the line for questions."

Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nCEO & Director, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk to you this morning about our results in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. John will also give you color on our operating environment and business development activities.\nI'll start by talking about VICI's first 5 years. A couple of weeks ago, we reached a 5-year anniversary of VICI's IPO. I want to thank every single VICI team and Board member for the incredible work they've done over this 5-year period, enabling VICI, among other things, to become the first REIT to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in under 5 years. And I want to thank all of our operating partners in and outside of gaming for the amazing work they do in making our building places a great experiential and economic value.\nIn February of 2018, the time of VICI's IPO, I don't think any of you would have been very excited if I told you that the ensuing 5-year period from VICI IPO through year-end 2022 would be a period in which the S&P 500 Index would generate cumulative total return over that period of 48.5% or that their RMZ REIT index would generate cumulative total return of 27.9%. I want to emphasize those are not annual total return figures. Those are cumulative over the entire period.\nAnd that's exactly what the S&P 500 and the RMZ REIT indices produced in cumulative total return over that period. Over that same period since our IPO, VICI produced for its shareholders cumulative total return of 109.7%. I'll repeat that, 109.7%. This cumulative total return by VICI beat the S&P by more than 2x and beat the REIT index by nearly 4x. Over that 5-year period, no other REIT in the S&P 500 produced cumulative total return superior to VICI, [ZIP, Zero, none].\nSince 2018, VICI has produced an AFFO per share compound annual growth of 7.7% and a quarterly dividend per share CAGR of 7.9%. If we look at 2022 by itself, we see another year in which VICI produced significant outperformance. VICI was the only S&P 500 REIT that produced positive total return in 2022. VICI's 2022 13% total return generated 31.1 points of outperformance versus the S&P 500 index overall and 37.5 points of outperformance versus the RMZ REIT index.\nOur stockholders have received the outperformance they've deserved over the last 5 years and in 2022, given the support they have been given VICI throughout our 5-year history of portfolio growth and balance sheet upgrading. What we're most excited about is the opportunity to continue to create value for our stockholders. In a moment, David Kieske will lay out for you our 2023 AFFO guidance. I don't want to steal all of David's thunder, but once David has shared that guidance with you, I encourage you to compare VICI's 2023 guidance to consensus 2023 S&P 500 earnings forecast which are generally trending between (technical difficulty) S&P 500 REITs.\nOnce you've made those comparisons, I believe you'll find that VICI offers what we believe to be one of the more compelling 2023 price earnings growth or PEG plus yield ratios that you will find among all S&P 500 REITs. To help you along in that calculation, I'll give you this starting point. The AFFO growth represented by the midpoint of our guidance plus our dividend yield as of yesterday equals 14.5%. Compare that 14.5% figure to what other S&P 500 REITs are offering in 2023 AFFO growth rates plus dividend yields, and I believe you will see VICI standing out.\nFinally, I'll give you one more comparison. With consensus estimates of S&P 500 2023 earnings per share growth running at 1% and the current S&P 500 dividend yield running around 1.6%, the combination of current estimated earnings growth and dividend yield would be 2.6% for the S&P 500. The combination of VICI's midpoint AFFO growth and our current dividend yield would be over 14%.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John for his remarks. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & COO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 5 years, our team has worked relentlessly to institutionalize our asset class and to deliver value for our shareholders by growing our portfolio accretively. During this time period, we've expanded our roster of tenants from just one at formation to 11 best-in-class operators who manage some of the most complex and profitable experiential assets across the globe.\nOur hard work has also resulted in growing our portfolio from 19 properties at formation to 49 assets today with our portfolio encompassing, what we believe, are some of the most iconic properties across all commercial real estate classes, and our real estate now crosses into international territory. Now none of this would have been possible without the effort of our dedicated team who on many occasions end up working nights, weekends and unfortunately, holidays. For that, we, as an executive management team are very, very grateful.\nIn some ways, 2022 was the hallmark of our achievements. Early in the year, we completed the acquisition of Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, arguably one of the most iconic experiential assets in the world at a very attractive 6.25% cap rate. Those of you who have followed our story may remember that the Venetian was announced during the very unique time period. While decision to acquire that asset may appear simple today, the transaction came together in early 2021 when many believe the recovery of Las Vegas was uncertain.\nDuring our underwriting period, we allocated resources towards studying the market and performing in-depth due diligence. Throughout that process, we grew increasingly confident in our underwriting and ultimately confirmed our very bullish bet on the Las Vegas market. As we sit here today, we continue to see that the Las Vegas market is producing record results. Leisure business remains robust, meetings and conventions have returned and consumers continue to visit the city in record number.\nIn essence, we believe consumers did not find a replacement for the experience offered by the Las Vegas market, nor do we believe they ever will. The Las Vegas economy continues to diversify, catering to a broad array of consumer preferences, and the city continues to leverage vast infrastructure by hosting unique events and events of scale. We remain firm believers in the Las Vegas market and will continue to be vocal about our belief in the outlook for the city.\nFollowing our completion of the Venetian transaction, just a few months later, we completed the strategic acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, adding 15 exceptional assets to our portfolio and beginning a formal relationship with MGM Resorts. These 2 transactions alone deliver growth that would satisfy many companies. However, as the year carried on, we supplemented those achievements with the pending acquisition of Rocky Gap casino in Maryland, an investment in our property growth fund. The acquisition of Blackstone's interest in the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay joint venture, which we closed in January. We closed on the acquisition of 2 additional regional gaming assets with Foundation Gaming. And we invested in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas alongside the renowned Koch Industries.\nIn addition to our achievements in gaming, we deepened our relationship with Great Wolf Resorts, during the year by financing certain growth projects, and we announced partnerships with Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch, widening our university of growth opportunities for years to come.\nLast, but surely not least, as the calendar turned to 2023, we announced our first international investment by closing on the acquisition of 4 casino properties in Alberta, Canada. We have talked about expanding our portfolio internationally on many of these earnings calls before and are thrilled to demonstrate once again that we do what we say. As we look ahead to 2023, we will be planting the seeds of growth for the next 5 years and beyond.\nFirst and foremost, we are going to continue establishing relationships that yield mutually beneficial outcomes. And as always, we intend to focus on opportunities that deliver accretive growth for our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet, our financial results and our guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2022 demonstrated the continued discipline we have maintained over our 5-plus years of existence by ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This focus provided VICI with continued access to the capital markets throughout 2022 to support our growth and just to recap a few highlights from the year.\nIn April, we achieved our goal of an investment-grade credit rating as both S&P and Fitch rated VICI BBB-, allowing us to raise $5 billion of investment-grade debt across a series of 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30-year tenures to fund the acquisition of NGP. VICI's ability to access the 30-year tenure was a first for a first-time investment-grade REIT issuer, and we are thankful for the support we received from our credit partners in this transaction.\nIn June, we were added to the S&P 500 Index, marking the fastest time line, a REIT has been added to the index from IPO to inclusion, deepening our access to equity capital. In November, we raised [$575.6] million of net equity proceeds through a 19 million share forward sale agreement, we utilized the ATM throughout the year, raising equity very efficiently for a total of $696.6 million in net proceeds through the sale of 21.6 million shares via forward sale agreements.\nThose amounts include $208.3 million through the sale of 6.3 million shares via forward sale agreements that occurred in Q4. Then subsequent to year-end, in January, we raised $965 million of net equity proceeds through a 30.3 million share forward sale agreement, which remains unsettled today and available to fund future transactions. Currently, we have approximately $3.8 billion in total liquidity comprised of $426 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. We have the $965 million of net proceeds from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility.\nAs a reminder, in January, we drew down CAD 140 million or approximately USD 103 million under our revolver in connection with our PURE Canadian gaming acquisition. We will look to term out this revolver draw in the future. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of [CMBS] debt that encumbers the MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of activity from our recent acquisitions is approximately 5.7x.\nWe have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.7 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues increased 100.9% year-over-year to $769.9 million in Q4 as a result of the transformative 2022 acquisition activity, John mentioned. AFFO for the fourth quarter was approximately $488 million or $0.51 per share. Total AFFO in Q4 increased approximately 75% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 15.5% over the prior year.\nJust as a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and the AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raised and shares issued to consummate our acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO with the year ending December 31, 2023, is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 per share and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance reflects the full year of 2022 closed acquisitions as well as the acquisitions we completed in January, the PURE Canadian Gaming acquisition and the acquisition of Blackstone's 49.9% stake in the MGM Grand Mandalay Bay JV.\nAdditionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 30.3 million forward shares sold in January of this year. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.\nAnd as we have discussed with you in the past, we recorded a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Secretary, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties described herein, please refer to respective company's public filings with the SEC.\nHosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Acquisitions and Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nCEO & Director, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2022 for VICI was a quarter of both realization and continuing activation. By realization, I mean that in Q3 2022, we realized the full magnitude and impact of our growth activities in 2021. And by activation, I mean that we continue to create incremental capital allocation opportunities for VICI, especially in non-gaming. The key benefits realized in Q3 2022 included growing our revenue by 100% versus the same quarter in 2021, manifesting the full impact of our acquisitions of the Venetian and MGP; growing our AFFO by 83% year-over-year; growing AFFO per share by 8.5% year-over-year; announcing a dividend increase of 8.3%, giving VICI a dividend compound annual growth rate of 8.2% since our emergence in October 2017.\nOur key growth activities in Q3 and early Q4 included announcing an additional $186 million of financings within our partnership with Great Wolf Resorts, announcing our $203.9 million acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort, announcing a $200 million real estate financing partnership with Canyon Ranch. In 2022, we've invested in relationships with high-quality partners operating in high-quality experiential segments. Our year-to-date capital allocation commitments, the ones I just mentioned, plus our Cabot investment announced in June 2022 and are expected to generate a going-in weighted average unlevered yield on investment of approximately 7.4%, as this nearly $710 million of capital is deployed over time.\nBefore I turn the call over to John Payne and David Kieske, who will talk about our outlook, growth activities and financial results, I want to say a few words about our new partnership with Canyon Ranch, which we announced just last week. When we announced our new partnership with Cabot Golf back in June, you heard me talk about our belief in the power and moat qualities of what we call pilgrimage experiences, many experiential categories, especially those with strong elements of expertise and/or knowledge accumulation are pyramidal in shape. And at the apex of these pyramids are the purest rarest realizations of that category's experience. These are experiences that tend to attract within that experiential category, the most valuable and loyal clientele, able and willing through all cycles to pay a premium for the purest realization of the experience to which they are devoted.\nAt VICI, as real estate investors, our thesis is a simple and, we believe, powerful one. Places of pilgrimage are places of great value. We want to and we are investing in these places. Cabot creates and operates golf resorts that represent pilgrimage experiences in golf. We are proud and excited to partner with Cabot on the creation of Cabot Citrus Farms is our next pilgrimage destination, and we believe we can partner on many subsequent opportunities with Cabot.\nOf us note as well the Las Vegas Strip is also a pilgrimage destination for people seeking apex experiences of all kinds. I was just there this week. It is the busiest place on Earth. In the experiential category of wellness and personal performance, Canyon Ranch has been, is, and I believe will be for decades to come, the market leader, creating an operating resort that represents a definition of pilgrimage experiences and wellness.\nThe Canyon Ranch brand was born in 1974. For nearly 50 years now, Canyon Ranch's clientele has traveled to Canyon Ranch Resorts to make the most important investment they can make, an investment in themselves, in the betterment of their lives, body, mind and spirit. The Canyon Ranch clientele, in order to make this investment and trust themselves to the Canyon Ranch team, an active trust that the Canyon Ranch team takes with existential seriousness.\nUnder the leadership of Chairman and Principal owner, John Goff, a legend in American real estate investing through his creation of Crescent real estate and CEO, Jeff Kuster, formerly North American head for Ralph Lauren. Canyon Ranch has built a wellness and human performance team of great strength and authority. This team includes by way of example, a former U.S. Sergeant General; a former Head of Sports Medicine Research and Innovation at the U.S. Olympic Committee; a former Head of Physical Therapy for the U.S. Women's National Soccer team; a former strength coach with the Philadelphia 76ers; a nationally-renowned behavioral therapists; physicians who have pioneered integrated and lifestyle medicine fields; former chef, dietitian at the U.S. Olympic Committee; and a Harvard Divinity School appointed spiritual innovator.\nThe Canyon Ranch clientele is able and willing to pay through all cyclicals premium for the experiences and life improvements they obtain at Canyon Ranch. As many of you know, I've worked across ski resorts, heli-ski resorts, beach resorts, golf resorts and now casino resorts. I can tell you, based on my experience that the Canyon Ranch capital and operating economic model is among the most compelling and productive I have seen in revenue intensity per dollar of capital invested, in margins and in the returns on invested capital.\nCanyon Ranch, we believe, will benefit greatly for decades to come from highly positive demographic and cultural tail. The growth opportunities for Canyon Ranch are manifold, both domestically and internationally, and we are very excited to be Canyon Ranch's capital partner funding this growth.\nYou can hear John Goff speak of the role he sees VICI playing and Canyon Ranch's growth. If you watch the Mad Money segment that John and I did with Jim Cramer on October 17. That clip can be found at our website, www.viciproperties.com.\nFinally, we're particularly excited about our first investment with Canyon Ranch because it enables us to invest capital into and ultimately gives us the opportunity to own high-quality real estate in one of America's most dynamic metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, a region that, at least for the foreseeable future, we cannot invest in through gaming. Let me now turn the call over to John Payne, who will talk about our outlook and growth activities. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & COO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. It's good to be talking to you this morning. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort in partnership with our existing tenant, Century Casinos. Upon closing, rent under our master lease with Century will increase by $15.5 million, representing a 7.6% acquisition cap rate.\nGiven our relationship with Century, we were able to leverage our existing master lease and our combined cost of capital to structure a transaction that work for all 3 parties involved, that being VICI, Century and Golden Entertainment, the seller of the asset. We're excited about expanding our relationship with Century as we've witnessed their relentless operating focus firsthand since we jointly acquired 3 regional assets in 2019.\nAnd upon the closing of Rocky Gap, we look forward to adding another remarkable regional destination asset to our portfolio. Moving to the outlook for growth. We are often asked how the transaction environment appears in real time. I'll repeat something I often say, which is that transactions do not come together overnight. Ed touched on our Great Wolf, Cabot and Canyon Ranch partnerships, and I would simply point out that the transactions we are able to discuss today represent just a fraction of the effort we undertake behind the scenes. Throughout the third quarter, our team remained as busy as ever introducing our company to potential partners and forging relationships across a variety of sectors. In fact, our entire company is actively involved in finding ways to position VICI as the capital partner of choice for gaming and experiential operators.\nAs you can imagine, capital market fluctuations can make it challenging to pinpoint our exact cost of capital at any given time. However, I stress that remaining discipline is core to our underwriting process. The landscape for transactions remains competitive, and it's important to understand that seller expectations do not necessarily adjust in real time. With that said, at VICI, we focus on what we can control, which is, one, our partnership approach. We encourage potential partners to speak to our existing tenants and believe we can position ourselves to ultimately win the ties.\nTwo, disciplined and rigorous underwriting, we strive for accretion in every transaction. And thanks to the work of our team, believe we can remain competitive. And third, finding ways to create our own success. The landscape for propco transaction is not zero sum. We've learned to adapt to a variety of scenarios and believe we can uncover opportunities that may not be obvious to our competitors.\nJust a few weeks ago, we crossed the 5-year mark since we started the company. We wholeheartedly believe that our track record, which includes over $30 billion of transaction speaks to our relentless focus and dedication to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to adhere to the approach that is responsible for our success to date and will strive to grow the company accretively for years to come. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and access to capital. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation and rising interest rates are not only dominating the financial news, but also factoring into the transaction market requiring buyers and sellers to adjust to a market backdrop we have not seen in many years. As John mentioned, VICI turned 5 years old on October 6. And since our inception, we have been disciplined in maintaining a positive spread to our cost of capital. So even in an environment where the 10-year treasury rate is north of 4%, a rate that many younger investors have never seen in their lifetime, VICI is focused on maintaining discipline in everything we pursue.\nWe are fortunate that we have built a balance sheet to weather these turbulent times with no floating rate debt, no maturities until 2024 and ample liquidity to deploy capital accretively with leading operators like we did with Century, Great Wolf and Canyon Ranch since the second quarter.\nIn terms of VICI's liquidity and balance sheet, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $726 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $490 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our outstanding forward sale agreements, $2.5 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw term loan.\nDuring the quarter, we sold approximately 3.9 million shares with an aggregate value of $135 million after fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement and as such, are not reflected on our balance sheet. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our prorata share of the BREIT JV debt.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction, is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.9 years to maturity.\nTurning to the income statement. As Ed mentioned, we doubled our GAAP revenue year-over-year, a feat we are very proud of, and I want to thank the entire VICI team for all their efforts in delivering this growth. AFFO for the third quarter was approximately $471 million or $0.49 per share. Total AFFO in Q3 increased 83% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased 8.5% over the prior year. As a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raised in shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of this year.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $12.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.\nTurning to guidance. We are updating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022, is expected to be between $1.682 billion and $1.692 billion or between $1.91 and $1.92 per diluted common share. Our updated guidance reflects the uncapped CPI lease escalation of 8.1% that VICI will receive under our Las Vegas master lease and regional master lease with Caesars, effective for the lease year beginning on November 1, 2022.\nAdditionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 15.3 million forward shares sold under our ATM program during Q2 and Q3. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.\nAs we have discussed in the past with you, we record a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO-focused, as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nWith that, Maegan, please open the line for questions."

Q2 2022 was a quintessentially VICI quarter. A lot happened, a lot of continuing transformation as we work to build VICI into one of America's highest-quality and large-scale REITs. Here's a quick recital of Q2's highlights.\nIG. In late April, VICI was elevated to investment grade credit status by S&P and Fitch. IG fundraise. In late April, we conducted our inaugural investment-grade debt raise, and that $5 billion raise was the largest debut, the largest single IG debt raise by any REIT in history. It was a debt raise conducted in conjunction with the funding of our MGP acquisition that proved the continuing energy and agility of David Kieske and the VICI finance team as the treasury swaps and locks that David and the team had put in place in late 2021 and early 2022 significantly reduced the net coupon of that debt.\nMGP closure. In late April, we closed on our acquisition of the real estate of 15 MGM assets. Magnificent examples of Class A real estate, thereby adding about $1 billion of new portfolio income and initiating our new partnership with MGM, a partnership, we believe, can grow substantially in the years ahead.\nS&P 500 inclusion. In early June, VICI was added to the S&P 500, making VICI the first American REIT in history to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in less than 5 years.\nPilgrimage experiences. In June, with Cabot Citrus Farms near Tampa, we announced what we believe will be the first of many capital and property partnerships with Cabot, a global leader in creating and operating Pilgrimage resort golf experiences.\nOur third tribal nation partnership. In June, we also announced that Cherokee Nation Entertainment Gaming Holdings will become in due course our new operating partner in Gold Strike in Tunica giving us yet another dynamic partner to grow with. These accomplishments significantly strengthen VICI's growth resources, capabilities and opportunities. But there's one other key Q2 accomplishment, and that accomplishment is the growth of our VICI leadership team. In early June, we added 2 very talented senior officers. Kellan Florio became our new Chief Investment Officer. Moira McCloskey became our new Vice President, Capital Markets. Kellan significantly adds to our ability to grow VICI's relationships in transactional activity with asset controllers, especially across non-gaming sectors.\nAnd Moira significantly strengthens our ability to further develop and sustain our relationships with capital providers, both equity and credit. Additionally, in June, we established the VICI Management Committee to continue to broaden and deepen VICI's strategic resources and reach. This committee of 7 includes Gabe Wasserman, Jeremy Waxman, Danny Valoy, Elena Keil, Cameron Lewis, Kellan Florio and Moira McCloskey. The VICI Management Committee, working with John, David, Samantha and me, will play an integral role in developing, and moreover, ensuring the execution of VICI's cultural ESG portfolio and total return goals and strategies in the years to come. They will be integral to the development of our growth ideas and our growth relationships and from the growth of our ideas and our relationships will come the creation of stakeholder value.\nIn a moment, John will tell you more about our current growth activities and David will talk about our financial results and our financial outlook. But first, let me say a few words about our current strategic outlook.\nAs you will hear further from John, our operating partners are delivering outstanding operating results, especially along the Las Vegas Strip, where we gather about 45% of our portfolio income. But you wouldn't know this from how the equity and debt of our publicly listed partners are trading right now. Granted trading values tend to be based on outlook rather than current performance and both the sell and buy sides (inaudible) understand and little bit concerned about a possible recession in the quarters ahead. But let me offer these 3 points. Point number one, gaming consumer resiliency. As we have discussed in the past, the gaming customer has proven to be more resilient through both garden-variety recessions and full-blown crises than just about any other discretionary consumer out there. That was proven through both the great financial crisis and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPoint number two, gaming operator resiliency. A couple of you on the sell side have produced well-reasoned analyses that show the gaming operators generally and many of our partners specifically will be in very solid shapes in terms of both free cash flow and balance sheet strength, even under fairly draconian recession scenarios in the year or so ahead. Our operators are responsive and agile in dealing with changing conditions. Both gaming consumer and gaming operator resiliency give VICI confidence in our belief that a possible recession will not harm the credit quality of our operators.\nBut in the meantime, and this brings me to my third point, there is absolutely no question that the relative attractiveness of VICI's capital to both our current and potential operating partners in both gaming and non-gaming has only strengthened in the last few months. With our investment-grade credit status and our S&P 500 inclusion, VICI's access to and cost of capital has strengthened on a relative basis at a time when most experiential operators have seen their access to capital severely curtailed and the cost of any incremental capital significantly increased.\nAs we proved with our Venetian acquisition, VICI has the capability to move quickly and decisively in market conditions that may cause others to pause. Current and especially prospective market conditions could yield VICI, we believe, highly attractive growth opportunities in the quarters ahead. And further the topic of growth, I'll now turn the call over to John Payne. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & COO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGP, expanding our portfolio to 43 of the highest quality experiential real estate assets under our triple-net model with a combined 58,000 hotel rooms, hundreds of food and beverage and entertainment outlets and millions of square feet of high-quality meeting and convention areas. Thanks to the tireless work of Team VICI, we've completed over $29 billion of transactions since our company's formation less than 5 years ago. We're very proud of these accomplishments, and at the same time, we're excited that our work has only just started. One of our primary objectives of our company is to work with our existing tenants to provide strategic objectives. As many of you have heard me say before, our team does not take a break after announcing or completing an acquisition. Our development team remains very active, expanding our relationships and sourcing opportunities that we believe will continue yielding accretive outcomes for VICI.\nDuring the second quarter, we entered in a long-term partnership with Cabot, a leading destination golf operator where we would provide funding for the redevelopment of Cabot Citrus Farms in Florida and convert a portion of our loan to real estate ownership under a long-term sale leaseback. We're very excited about this relationship, and we'll look to potentially expand with Cabot over the coming years.\nWhile many of you enjoy asking questions about on-the-ground operating trends, I would like to remind you that we are a triple-net lease landlord. We collect fixed rent streams with annual escalations over very long periods of time. Those who have followed our story will recall that we continue to collect 100% of cash rent when every one of our properties was forced to close due to the government-mandated restrictions in response to COVID-19. There have been many questions about the outlook for consumer spending, and I would simply repeat that our income does not fluctuate based on monthly or quarterly trends.\nNow with that said, in Las Vegas, The Strip continues to produce incredibly strong numbers. For example, gross gaming revenue in May was 41% above 2019 levels and Harry Reid International Airport just registered an all-time record for passenger traffic this past June. While the growth rates are becoming more difficult to surpass given the record activity levels, the gaming industry has proven its resilience over decades. And anyone who researches operator profitability will understand that the business models are leaner and more flexible today as compared to pre-COVID years. The gaming operator successfully navigated a very uncertain period at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and emerged on stronger footing with record-breaking margin expansion as they've created ways to monitor consumer activity and adjust their cost structures accordingly. We are very proud of our track record to date, and our relationship was stable, industry-leading tenant. We will remain disciplined as we evaluate opportunities and ensure future acquisitions satisfy our investment criteria.\nThanks to our exceptional balance sheet, which David will touch on, we believe we're in a very strong position as we evaluate growth opportunities. In an environment where cost of capital fluctuates daily, we will continue to pursue transactions with appropriate underwriting and accretion for our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet and overall liquidity available to VICI to fund future growth.\nTo recap the second quarter events, on April 18, VICI was upgraded to investment grade by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20, we priced $5 billion of investment-grade senior unsecured notes, executing the largest REIT investment-grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the notes was 5%, while the effective interest rate after taking into account our $3 billion hedge portfolio was 4.51%. On April 29, we closed on the acquisition of MGP as well as the $5 billion bond offering. We used $4.4 billion of the proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units.\nThe remaining proceeds plus cash on hand were used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. The company also issued approximately $4.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes in exchange for and with the same interest rate, maturity date and redemption terms as notes originally issued by MGP pursuant to the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations. Following the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations, approximately $90 million of the original MGP notes remain outstanding.\nIn terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 7.2 years to maturity.\nWe have had many accomplishments in our short existence as a public company, but being added to the S&P 500 Index on June 8 is a continued endorsement of our growth. As mentioned, VICI was the fastest REIT to be added to the S&P 500 Index from IPO to inclusion, and we believe being added to the index will broaden our investor base and improve our access to equity capital.\nDuring the quarter, we sold approximately 11.4 million shares with an aggregate value of $367.4 million before fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement and, as such, are not reflected on our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $614 million in cash and cash equivalents, $360 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our forward sale agreement, $2.5 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw facility. In July, the revolving credit facility was amended to permit borrowings in certain foreign currencies up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1.25 billion, enhancing our financial flexibility.\nTurning to the income statement. AFFO for the second quarter was $430.1 million or $0.48 per share. Total AFFO in Q2 increased 67.9% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 4% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raised and shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP. At the end of Q2, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding, and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM, which were received in the merger. A full reconciliation of the share count is included in our earnings release.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\nOur G&A was $11.8 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, was only 1.8%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We believe this represents the appropriate go-forward run rate when accounting for the increase in certain expenses related to the MGP acquisition.\nI just want to touch on CECL, or current expected credit losses. Out of the $552 million noncash charge we incurred in Q2, 80% or approximately $443 million was related to the initial allowance we were required to record upon entering into the MGM master lease. This allowance did reduce our GAAP net income for the quarter. But as previously noted, noncash CECL charges do not impact cash flow or AFFO.\nTurning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. The per-share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 11.4 million forward shares sold from our ATM program in Q2. And as we have discussed, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability, leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022, is expected to be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted common share.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel of VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Secretary, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of the words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.\nTherefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information.\nFor additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties described herein, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nCEO & Director, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Happy Cinco de Mayo. When we held our last earnings call in late February, we had just closed on our acquisition of The Venetian, one of the largest scale and highest quality single assets in American commercial real estate. As we speak with you today, we have just closed on our acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, MGP, one of the largest scale and highest quality portfolios of Class A real estate in American real estate investing. VICI's story over the last 14 months since we first announced our acquisition of The Venetian, is a story of transformation.\nWe have transformed the scale of our portfolio, our tenant and geographic diversity and very importantly, the character and quality of our balance sheet. We've also become the leading real estate owner on what we believe is the most economically productive street in the world, the Las Vegas strip. In a moment, John Payne will talk further about the transformation of our portfolio, and David Kieske will talk further about the transformation of our balance sheet.\nBut let me first spend a few moments talking with you about what's been proven about our business model over the last 2 years and how timely our current transformation may prove to be from both offensive and defensive perspective over a coming period of economic uncertainty. Over the last 2 years, COVID-19 proved the resiliency of VICI's business model because COVID proved the resiliency of our tenants' business models. VICI collected 100% of our rent in cash and on time throughout the COVID-19 crisis because of the operating excellence and operating liquidity of our tenants.\nOur operators have shown their ability to operate through thick and thin. The economic outlook for the next year or 2 may be murky, but we firmly believe that our operators' prepared their operating revenue, cost and liquidity models for whatever may be coming. What about our view on VICI's ability to continue to grow in the coming period? There are 5 key capabilities as we see it to growing as a net lease REIT in all cycles, including whatever cycle may be about doing 2.\nNumber one, same-store NOI growth based on key lease terms regarding escalation and CPI protection; number two, internal funding capability based on cash retention; number three, the capability and opportunity to invest incrementally in existing assets and return for incremental rent; number four, the ability to source acquisitions when the frequency and intensity of asset marketing processes lessen; number five, access to investment-grade credit when high-yield markets may be constricted or costly.\nLet me say a few words about VICI's growth capabilities in each of these 5 areas: point number one, same-store NOI growth. Green Street in the September 2021 analysis showed that VICI generates same-store NOI growth more than 4x higher than net lease rates on average. And in terms of higher -- in times, sorry, of higher inflation, VICI's same-store NOI superiority versus other net lease rates expand when factoring in the CPI owned into our leases. Point number two, internal funding capability.\nPro forma for the annualization of VICI's net income and debt service, having enclosed Venetian and MGP, if we maintain a dividend payout ratio between 75% and 80%, that would leave between $400 million to $500 million of retained earnings available to us for investment annually, a competitive advantage during periods when market may be constricted.\nPoint number three, investing incrementally in existing property in return for incremental rent. Our assets measure, on average, over 2.5 million square feet and sit on many acres of land. That scale of building and land enable us to invest incrementally in our existing properties in ways generally not available to net lease REITs whose stores generally average around 25,000 square feet, 1/100 the size of our assets. Point number four, sourcing acquisitions when asset marketing processes lessen. You've heard us say before that we grow our business at VICI and our portfolio by growing our relationships.\nAs we pursue both gaming and non-gaming investments in the coming years outside of marketing processes, we are confident that our ability to generate new relationships with operators who operate in net lease white space will give us growth advantages. Point number five, in -- just to investment grade with high-yield credit markets tighten. Through the great work of David Kieske, Erin Ferreri and other members of our finance team, we achieved investment-grade status with S&P and Fitch about 2 weeks ago. We may be in the early stages of a challenging period for the high-yield credit markets and CMBS financing.\nWe believe that the relative competitiveness and attractiveness of our capital could increase during the coming period as experiential operators look to refinance their existing businesses and/or fund their growth initiatives. To sum up, VICI has gotten bigger and moreover stronger at a -- we believe advantages will accrue to those REITs that are bigger and stronger. I'll now turn the call over to John, who will talk about our new portfolio and operating conditions and to David, who will talk about our financial results and balance sheet upgrade. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & COO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. The first 4 months of 2022 were very productive for VICI. In February, we completed The Venetian Las Vegas transaction. And just last week, as Ed noted, we closed on the acquisition of MGP adding 15 Class A market-leading assets with over 33,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of convention space and hundreds of food and beverage outlets to our portfolio. As a management team, having the opportunity to acquire the MGP portfolio in a master lease structured where the cash flow is cross-collateralized with inflation protection beginning in lease year 11 and a corporate guarantee from MGM Resorts is something we are very proud to have accomplished on behalf of our shareholders.\nOur 43 asset portfolio is unmatched in size, scope and quality in the triple net sector, and we plan to continue to grow our asset base with our best-in-class tenant roster as well as new operators. As some of you may know from recent data that has been released, Las Vegas continues to be a top destination choice by consumers and the Las Vegas Strip remains one of the most economically productive streets in the world. Gaming revenue in Las Vegas in March alone came in at $746 million, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. I'm going to repeat that. Approximately 35% above 2019 levels.\nAdditionally, the outlook for room revenue is very strong as midweek business continues to normalize with convention business returning to the city. On their first quarter earnings call, both MGM and Caesars cited 90% hotel occupancy in March and Las Vegas room rate surveys published by the Sell Side have pointed to second quarter ADRs that are tracking 30% above 2019 levels. The City of Las Vegas with its diversified entertainment economy that is no longer just about gambling, but centered around business, sports, and entertainment, continues to prove to be the top destination in the U.S. and possibly the world.\nAs a real estate investment trust in the business of owning and leasing integrated entertainment resorts within a triple-net structure, we are big believers in Las Vegas for decades to come and are incredibly excited to now own 10 world-class assets and a total of 660 acres along the Las Vegas Strip. Our regional casino assets with regional markets in general also remained extremely healthy. In case you somehow missed the first 4 months of 2022, I'll give you the cliff note version. In a nutshell, the casino industry is in amazing shape right now.\nSeveral operators, including Boyd Gaming, Churchill Downs, MGM and Caesars have made it quite clear with their quarter 1 earnings releases and conference calls that the reports of the decline of the U.S. regional casino margins have been greatly exaggerated. April results have continued the March strength and not only is the gaming consumer healthy, wealthy and wise, they are still choosing to spend money on gambling despite having many other entertainment options. As we think about what comes next for VICI, we are fortunate to have executed some of the largest and most complex transactions in the net lease industry, and we will continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver accretive value for our shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results, our balance sheet and our guidance. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll start with our balance sheet. At the beginning of 2022, encapsulates the energy we have brought to transforming our balance sheet since VICI emerged in October 2017. We have discussed this relentless balance sheet focus with you over the last 4.5 years. We believe it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners to -- deserve. Not to spend too much time on 2021, but is a good reminder of how we take the long-term view to safeguard our company.\nWe raised a combined total of $5.4 billion of equity at the time of the announcement of The Venetian acquisition and shortly after the announcement of the MGP transaction. These equity offerings derisk the equity funding well ahead of closing on our $21 billion of announced acquisitions and allowed us to repay all of our secured debt last September. These actions set us up for success in early 2022 and for years to come. On February 8, we closed on our new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital.\nOn February 23, we closed on the $4 billion acquisition of Venetian through the settlement of 2 outstanding forwards, bringing 119 million shares onto the balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We also drew $600 million on our revolver, and used cash on hand to fund The Venetian. On April 18, VICI's debt rating was upgraded to BBB- by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20, we priced $5 billion of investment-grade senior unsecured notes, executing on the largest REIT investment-grade bond offering ever.\nThe blended cash interest rate for the senior unsecured notes was 5%. The effective interest rate after taking into account our hedge portfolio, which was comprised of $2.5 billion in notional amount of forward starting swaps and $500 million in notional amount of treasury locks is 4.51%. On April 29, we closed on the acquisition of MGP as well as a $5 billion bond offering. We used $4.404 billion of the bond offering proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. Following the MGP acquisition, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM that were received in the merger. The remaining proceeds from the bond offering plus cash on hand were used to repay the $600 million outstanding under VICI's revolving credit facility.\nIn terms of leverage, we ended Q1 2022 with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.6x. This highlights the fact that we significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As we sit here today, pro forma for the MGP transaction, we have total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt on a run rate net debt to adjusted EBITDA -- excuse me, on a run rate, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 8.4 years to maturity.\nJust touching on the income statement. AFFO for the first quarter was $305.5 million or $0.44 per share. Total AFFO in Q1 2022 increased 19.8% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 5.1% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 26.3% primarily as a result of the regular weight portion of the September 2021 equity offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet, the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement last September, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet and the settlement of the March and September 4 sale agreements in February of 2022, which added 119 million shares to our balance sheet.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $9.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.3%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are updating our AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis.\nAs a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activities or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed in the past, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nOur guidance incorporates the recently closed MGP acquisition, including the issuance of 214.5 million shares of common stock to former MGP stockholders and the $5 billion bond offering we executed subsequent to quarter end. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022 will be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted share. With that, operator, we ask you to please open up the line for questions."

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 24, 2022.\nI would now hand the conference over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\n\nSamantha Sacks Gallagher\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Secretary, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com.\nSome of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them.\nI refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition.

Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Baltazar Pitoniak\n\nCEO & Director, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, let me just say on behalf of VICI that our hearts very much go out this morning to the people of Ukraine.\nToday, I want to begin the call by addressing 2 topics: VICI's growth and total return over our first 4 years, and our closing of our Venetian acquisition and what it signifies about VICI and our asset class. I'll then turn the call over to John, who will talk about our ongoing growth initiatives; and to David, who will talk about our 2021 results and our financing activities.\nThe year we just concluded, 2021, constituted VICI's fourth full year of operations and growth. If measured from our emergence date in October 2017, a bit more than 4 years ago, we've accomplished following: We have announced $29 billion of acquisitions, establishing VICI as one of the most dynamic growth platforms in American REIT management. We have raised more than $12 billion of common equity, more than any other REIT in America over that period. Pro forma for our announced acquisitions, we will have grown our portfolio NOI by more than 4x. We have lowered our leverage from 8.5x adjusted EBITDA at emergence to 3.1x at the end of 2021, and moreover, transformed the right side of our balance sheet from entirely secured to substantially unsecured debt. And by transforming the magnitude and composition of our debt, we have put ourselves, we believe, on the cusp of investment-grade ratings.\nWe've demonstrated the resilience of our assets and of our tenants through 100% on time cash rent collection throughout the COVID pandemic to date. Most importantly, for VICI's stockholders, we generated from October 18, 2017, through December 31, 2021, a total return of 100.5%. This compares to the S&P 500 total return of 100.7% over that period and a total return for the RMZ of 58.9%, meaning VICI outperformed the RMZ over that period by 41.6 percentage points.\nHere's a simpler way of looking at it: $1 invested into VICI at the beginning of that period became $2, $1 invested into the RMZ over the same period became $1.59. An integral part of VICI's superior total return has been VICI's dividend growth over the period, with aggregate dividend per share growth of 37.1% since our first full quarter dividend payment in Q2 2018.\nWe're proud of the value we've created over our first 4 years, but here's what we're really excited about today. We just closed yesterday on the acquisition of one of the most magnificent Class A assets in American commercial real estate, The Venetian. Let me reiterate the features we cited when we announced the Venetian transaction nearly a year ago. The Venetian is the single largest hotel complex in America with nearly 7,100 rooms. The Venetian is the largest private sector meeting convention trade show facility in America. At 13 million square feet of Class A quality, finding another building in America with more marble, we have bought the Venetian at a price per square foot of approximately $300, 82 acres of land that included an estimated 62% discount replacement cost.\nWhen we announced The Venetian acquisition in early March 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was still heavily and negatively impacting Las Vegas visitation and resort performance. Apollo, our new Venetian operating partner, and VICI were both mindful of that. And in a period when most potential Venetian buyers were not willing or able to come out into the heavy weather, VICI and Apollo were able to craft a transaction that a protected against continuing uncertainty, but was fundamentally based in the belief that Las Vegas and moreover, The Venetian would eventually return to 2019 levels of performance.\nWhat VICI and Apollo did not assume when we announced this transaction in March 2021 is that Las Vegas and The Venetian would, over the ensuing 12 months, stage a roaring comeback, achieving run rate profitability levels that are beyond 2019.\nOver the last 12 months, Rob Goldstein and Patrick Dumont's team at Las Vegas Sands, led by George Marcantonis, have done a magnificent job of managing The Venetian. As LBS reported on January 26, The Venetian produced these eye-popping performance figures in Q4 2021. 100% occupancy of The Venetian's nearly 7,100 rooms and doing so without the full return of meeting, convention, trade show business.\nFor the fourth quarter, The Venetian generated $154 million of adjusted property EBITDA at a margin of 34.5%. This amount of EBITDA annualized would mean over $600 million of run rate EBITDA before rent or nearly 2.5x coverage of our initial Venetian annual rent of $250 million.\nAs for value, I just want to remind everyone that we have acquired The Venetian, again, one of the most magnificent and majestic Class A assets in American commercial real estate, at a cap rate of 6.25%, which we believe makes this one of the most compelling Class A single asset transactions in America REIT management in recent years. And if it isn't selling, you need to tell me what comped it.\nAnd here, as much work as I put into preparing these remarks, I actually -- I have to quote one of you who posted last night this statement, which I think says better than anything I've said, what we did in buying The Venetian. To quote, \"Simply put, VICI got a pretty sweet deal. By looking past the short-term disruption in Las Vegas created by COVID, VICI was able to get one of the most iconic real estate assets in the country for a cap rate that today couldn't even buy you a well-located Dollar General.\"\nFinally, not only did we buy Venetian at a 6.25% cap rate, we have leased the Class A real estate of The Venetian to Apollo on a triple net basis with the superior economic transparency and integrity that the triple net lease model generally provides. And that highlights the final point I want to make about our first 4 years at VICI.\nOver this period, one can say that we have brought gaming real estate into the triple net lease sector. But I think what's more important is that we have brought the superiority of the triple net lease model to Class A real estate. Triple net real estate is sometimes criticized for being commodity real estate in low barrier-to-entry locations bought at a premium to replacement cost.\nHere's what we've done in VICI in our first 4 years in real estate investment terms. We've built America's biggest and best portfolio of differentiated noncommodity Class A experiential real estate in high-barrier-to-entry locations bought at substantial discounts to replacement cost. And here may be the most important portfolio attribute of all. Our real estate is occupied by, we believe, the best experiential operators in the world as evidenced by their market-leading resilience during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic and their market-leading recovery to unprecedented levels of profitability.\nThanks for bearing with me while I share my excitement for what we've done at VICI. And now I'll turn the call over to John Payne, who will share our excitement over what we're doing to continue to grow VICI. John?\n\nJohn W. R. Payne\n\nPresident & COO, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. 2021 sure was another successful and transformative year for VICI as we announced over $21 billion of transactions, solidifying our position as the #1 experiential REIT in terms of acquisition volume, significantly increasing our scale and furthering our credibility as one of America's blue-chip REITs.\nAs Ed said, we are very happy to announce that the acquisition of Venetian Las Vegas closed yesterday. And our acquisition of MGP remains on track to close in the first half of this year. Since we announced the acquisition of The Venetian, we witnessed cap rate compression in Las Vegas seemingly in real time, with City Center trading at a 5.5% cap rate and The Cosmopolitan at a 4.97% cap.\nAdditionally, since our announced acquisition of MGP, regional cap rates have continued to compress, with Encore Boston Harbor, a large-scale, high-quality urban asset recently trading at a cap rate in the high 5s. We have been pounding the table about the quality of gaming real estate and its superior investment characteristics relative to many real estate asset classics -- classes since our formation. We believe that in many ways, the most recent trading cap rates are directly applicable to the value of the assets in our portfolio. It is gratifying to see our thesis come to fruition. And we believe there's much more to come as gaming real estate becomes a mainstream real estate asset class.\nUpon closing our MGP transaction, we believe we will have a portfolio of assets with quality unmatched by any other leisure real estate portfolio. Our rental streams and underlying asset cash flow durability has proven through the -- has been proven through the pandemic. We have tenant relationships with industry-leading operators who utilize extensive CRM capabilities to be engaged with the consumers. And as many of you know, these capabilities, combined with our tenants' operational expertise, has led to record profitability in Las Vegas and across the region.\nNow as we think about VICI's future growth prospects, we see a long runway for growth within gaming. Many operators continue to study and understand how VICI's capital can be utilized in their capital stack. And we have regular dialogue with a number of public and private operators that continue to own their real estate. Additionally, we've started allocating capital towards other leisure verticals, which we believe will round out our investments over time.\nWe will approach additional leisure investments in a prudent manner by studying the opportunities and market dynamics in detail and perform an appropriate diligence and risk-reward analysis prior to allocating capital on behalf of our shareholders.\nOne of our fundamental goals as a company is to grow earnings per share accretively on behalf of our shareholders. We believe this aligns our success with the interest of our shareholders, and we do not approach investments blindly in order to just satisfy investment volumes or other arbitrary measurements. To that end, I will repeat the pillars that we believe will drive accretive growth for VICI and create value for our shareholders well into the future.\nWe will strive to execute the compelling opportunities in our embedded growth pipeline. We will study and evaluate open-market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally. We will partner with existing tenants under our property growth fund, through which we will seek to fund high-return growth projects at our existing properties. And we will allocate resources towards studying leisure and experiential investments as well as large-scale M&A opportunities.\nNow I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and our financial results. David?\n\nDavid Andrew Kieske\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, VICI Properties Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2021 continued the relentless focus we have maintained over our 4-plus years of existence on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This disciplined focus was rewarded during 2021 by: first, the depth of the support from the equity capital markets to de-risk the equity funding for our $21 billion of announced acquisitions; and second, from the culmination of one of our most important objectives since emergence, and that is to finally transform our balance sheet into an unsecured borrower. As Ed mentioned, we believe we are on the cusp of achieving an investment-grade rating.\nTo recap, as we look back at 2021, in March, we raised $2 billion of equity through a 69 million share forward sale agreement. In September, we raised $3.4 billion of equity through a 65 million share regular way offering and a 50 million share forward sale agreement. Raising $5.4 billion of equity is not something we take for granted, and we greatly appreciate the support of our equity holders to be able to de-risk the equity funding and take advantage of 2 unique opportunities that presented themselves during the year.\nThe September offering, in fact, was recognized by International Financing Review, or IFR, as the North America secondary equity issue of the year. We are thankful to our underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley as well as a full syndicate of banks, for the support to be able to execute the largest common equity follow-on ever by a REIT.\nIn September, we fully repaid our $2.1 billion secured term loan. This was a critical step on our path towards investment grade. Also in September, we announced the successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events in default under the existing VICI indentures.\nIn December, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into 3 additional agreements with a notional amount of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swap transactions, so far totaling $2 billion, are intended to reduce the variability in the interest expense related to the debt we expect to incur with the closing of the MGP acquisition.\nIn addition, subsequent to year-end, we closed on a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing our overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. The revolver maturity runs to March of 2026 before extension options with grid-based pricing.\nBased on the company's current credit ratings, the revolving credit facility bears interest at SOFR plus 132.5 basis points, an improvement in pricing from 200 basis points over LIBOR under our prior secured revolving credit facility.\nJust to recap The Venetian funding, which we closed yesterday. We settled the March and September outstanding forward sale agreements, bringing 119 million shares onto our balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We drew $600 million on our revolver with the remaining proceeds coming from cash to close the $4 billion Venetian acquisition.\nI also want to highlight that the settlement of the 2 forward sale agreements will all but eliminate the outsized short interest that VICI has been subject to. As of January 31, we had approximately 85 million shares of short interest, which the majority was from the mechanics of the forward sale agreements.\nTo summarize 2021 and the events at the start of 2022 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are to: maintain a long-term target leverage goal of 5 to 5.5x on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis; maintain an unsecured capital structure and an unencumbered asset pool; pursue a disciplined composition and laddering of fixed rate debt, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility; opportunistically accessing the capital markets to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and ultimately, achieving an investment-grade rating.\nWe have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating, and we believe the actions we took during 2021 and at the start of 2022 should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion permitted debt required to redeem the MGM OP units at the time of closing the MGP transaction, all while continuing to maintain ample liquidity, flexibility and optionality to grow accretively.\nTurning to the income statement. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $278.9 million or $0.44 per share, bringing full year 2021 AFFO to $1.0474 billion or $1.82 per share. Total AFFO in 2021 increased 25.3% year-over-year while AFFO per share increased approximately 11% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count and resulting temporary dilution from the March and September forward equity offerings.\nOur fully diluted share count increased approximately 12.9% primarily as the result of the settlements of the June 2020 forward sale agreement in September of 2021, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet in the regular way portion of the September offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet. The proceeds from both of these offerings were used to repay the $2.1 billion secured term loan in September.\nWe refer you to our press release where we've added 2 tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 5 of our release that was posted to our website last night.\nOur results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $9 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenue was only 2.4%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector.\nFinally, I want to touch on our leverage. We ended 2021 with net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.1x. And pro forma for The Venetian closing, our net debt-to-EBITDA is 3x. This highlights the fact that we have significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt required to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction.\nAs I touch on guidance, this will be important. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions, specifically the pending acquisition of MGP or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.\nAs we have discussed, we record a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.\nOur guidance incorporates the recently closed Venetian acquisition and the settlement of the 119 million shares that were subject to the March and September forward sale agreements. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022, will be between $1.317 billion and $1.347 billion or between $1.80 and $1.84 per diluted share. The midpoint of our total AFFO guidance on an absolute dollars represents an increase of 27.2% versus our 2021 actual AFFO.\nOn a per share basis, guidance reflects all of the equity raised to close the transactions we announced in 2021 and thus, the corresponding increase in VICI's share count without the benefit of the corresponding income from the pending MGP transaction. Accordingly, we expect to update guidance in the future to reflect the impact of the MGP transaction when we are in a position to do so.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

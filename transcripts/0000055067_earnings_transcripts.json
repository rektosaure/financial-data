My name is Mark and I will be your conference operator today . At this time , I would like to welcome everyone to the KINROSS GOLD CORP third quarter 2020 results conference call and webcast .\n\nAll lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise . After the speaker's remarks , there will be a question and answer session .\n\nIf you would like to ask a question during this time , simply press star , followed by the number one on your telephone keypad .\n\nAnd to withdraw your question , press star one again . Now I would like to turn the call over to David Shaver Senior Vice President , Investor Relations .\n\nPlease go ahead .\n\nThank you , and good morning . In the room with us today on the call , we have Paul Rollinson , CEO and from the Kinross senior leadership team .\n\nAndrea Freeborough Claude Schimper William Dunford and Jeff Gould . For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward looking information , please refer to page three of this presentation .\n\nOur news release , dated November 4th , 2025 . The mDNA for the period ended September 30th , 2025 and our most recently filed AIF , all of which are available on our website .\n\nI will now turn the call over to Paul . Thanks .\n\nDavid , and thank you all for joining us this morning . I will discuss our third quarter results , provide high level updates across our portfolio , comment on sustainability , and confirm our outlook .\n\nI will then hand the call over to the team to provide more detail . Following an excellent first half , hour portfolio of mines continued to perform well in Q3 .\n\nProduction in the quarter was on plan , delivering 504,000oz at a cost of sales of $1,145 per ounce . The strength of our operating portfolio , combined with good cost management and favorable gold prices , resulted in another quarter of strong operating margins .\n\nAs a result , in Q3 , we delivered another quarter of record free cash flow of nearly $700 million and over $1.7 billion year to date .\n\nOur business is in excellent shape , underpinned by a very strong balance sheet , robust operational outlook and significant cash flow generation . In accordance with our disciplined capital allocation framework .\n\nWe are committed to further strengthening our balance sheet through additional debt repayment and enhancing returns for shareholders . We have returned significant capital through our dividend and share repurchases .\n\nGiven our strong position , we are now planning to increase our return of capital to shareholders beyond the minimum $650 million we committed for this year .\n\nAndrea will provide further details on our capital allocation plans later . Turning to our operational highlights in Q3 . Erika and Cassius delivered substantial production at good costs , generating robust free cash flow .\n\nCaricature was once again the highest producer in the portfolio and remains well on track to deliver close to 600,000oz . At Tasiast . Both the mine and mill continued to perform well , with production in the third quarter , delivering as planned and operations remain on track to beat guidance .\n\nAt performance improved in the third quarter and the site remains on track to meet its full year production guidance . At our US assets , production and costs were on budget in Q3 and also remained well positioned to meet guidance in Alaska .\n\nWe saw consistent production with strong contributions from both Fort Knox and Mancho in Nevada , production from Bald Mountain and Round Mountain were , as planned at Bald Mountain .\n\nMining of Redbird . One continued to ramp up and steady work for Redbird two , along with numerous additional satellite opportunities , is ongoing at Round Mountain .\n\nInitial production from phase S continued to ramp up following the completion of mining at phase W . At phase X , underground development is progressing well , with over five kilometres advanced to date and infill drilling continues to return .\n\nExcellent grades and widths. With respect to our broader project pipeline, we continue to make steady progress at Curlew, Great Bear, and Lobo-Marte.\n\nIn the third quarter . These projects , along with other organic opportunities , continued to be backed by an extensive resource base with excellent long term optionality .\n\nOur strong in-house technical team continues to evaluate these value generating investment opportunities that we may choose to invest in to continue to grow shareholder value .\n\nTurning now to a few remarks on sustainability in Q3 , we continued to provide meaningful impact in our host countries . For example , in Mauritania , we contributed to local educational infrastructure by developing new school facilities in the interior region in Brazil .\n\nPericoptus Tailing facilities recently received the top level Double-A classification from the Engineer of record . This is a strong endorsement of the site's safety practices , reflecting industry leading standards in monitoring , maintenance and risk control , and in Arvada , Bald Mountain earned the Nevada Excellence in Mine Reclamation and Earthworks Award .\n\nTurning now to our outlook . Through the first nine months , we have produced over 1.5 million ounces at a cost of sales , in line with our annual guidance .\n\nOperations remain on track in the fourth quarter , and we are firmly positioned to achieve our full year targets . Looking forward , we will remain focused on rigorous operational and financial discipline to deliver strong margins and cash flow to support strong returns for our shareholders .\n\nWith that , I will now turn the call over to Andrea . Thanks , Paul .\n\nThis morning I will review our financial highlights from the quarter , provide an update on our balance sheet and return of capital programme , and comment on our guidance and outlook in Q3 , we produced and sold 504,000 gold equivalent ounces .\n\nCost of sales was $1,145 per ounce , and with an average realized gold price of $3,458 per ounce , we delivered margins of over $2,300 per ounce .\n\nCost of sales increased quarter over quarter due to planned mine sequencing , and the impact of higher gold prices on royalties , all in sustaining costs .\n\nAlso increased as compared to Q2 for the same reasons , as well as timing of sustaining capital expenditures . In Q3 . Our adjusted earnings were $0.44 per share and adjusted operating cash flow was $845 million .\n\nAttributable CapEx was $308 million , with slightly more sustaining capital versus growth attributable free cash flow was a record $687 million , or $538 million , excluding changes in working capital .\n\nAnd we received an additional $136 million of cash in Q3 from the divestiture of our Torano mine . Turning to our balance sheet , our strong financial position continued to improve in Q3 .\n\nAccording to our guidance, fully your production is on track to be slightly above the midpoint of our Guidance with fourth quarter, production expected to be slightly lower than 500,000 Oz.\n\nOperating costs and ASC remain on track to meet our full year guidance. Despite higher royalty costs from higher gold prices,\n\nall in sustaining costs is expected to be within the upper range of our guidance, as a result of a higher proportion of sustaining Capital with Q4 all in sustaining costs expected to be above Q3\n\ntotal Capital expenditures remain on track to meet guidance of 1.15 billion dollars.\n\nWith respect to our cash flow Outlook next year. As typical for us, we will have seasonal tax payments due in the first half.\n\nGiven the higher gold price. We expect these payments to be higher as they relate largely to income realized in 2025.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nThank you, Andrea.\n\nManagement training.\n\nAnd we have had an enthusiastic response from our Workforce on this initiative.\n\nAnd we will continue to innovate in our we approach, safety at each of our operations.\n\nOur Focus remains on reinforcing, a collective effort to manage costs and capture margin in the strong gold price environment.\n\nGoing beyond our focus on operational performance, we have put emphasis on getting the best value of our of our contracts.\n\nIncreasing Labour efficiencies.\n\nImproving maintenance and right sizing consumables, as part of our broader cost management strategy.\n\nGoing to the summary of our operations.\n\nStarting with parakeet, 2 production of 150,000 Oz was in line with the prior quarter.\n\nOur cost of sales of 933 per ounce, decreased quarter over quarter.\n\nBack to do so strong mining rates more recoveries and higher grades in the third quarter.\n\nAnd paracatu remains firmly on track to meet its guidance storage.\n\nAt Tas we delivered budgeted production of 121,000 ounces and a cost of sales of 889 per ounce.\n\nWith production in line over the prior quarter.\n\nProduction was supported by strong milk performance, including High, recoveries, following the recent em optimization initiatives.\n\nCapital development of the FedEx satellite pit. Also ramped up in a third quarter and remains on plan.\n\nAs is remains on track to meet these production guidance of 500,000 Oz at a Target cost of sales of 860 per ounce for the year.\n\nAt the equation, we produce 58,000 Oz at a cost of sales of 1,199 pounds which improved over the prior quarter as planned.\n\nProduction and cost improved as mining transitioned into the higher grade or from phase 7.\n\nThe production is expected to be stronger in the final quarter as mining continues through this higher grade off.\n\nThe corpora remains on track to meet its full year guidance.\n\nOf 230,000 Oz.\n\nCollectively the US, sites, delivered production of 175,000 ounces and it cost a sales of 1,469 per ounce in the third quarter.\n\nProduction in the U.S. operations was as planned and collectively remains on track to fully meet your guidance of 685,000 oz at a cost of sales of $1,420 per.\n\nIn Alaska, third quarter production from Fort Knox of 96,000 Oz was in line with the prior quarter.\n\nAcross the sales of 1,372 per ounce was higher over the prior quarter due to more operating waste tons. They said,\n\nAt 4 Mountain, we produced 42,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,148 per ounce.\n\nProduction decreased over the pride quarter due to the lower grades as planned, resulting in a higher cost of sales.\n\nAt Round Mountain Production of 37,000 Oz was in line with the prior quarter.\n\nThe cost of sales of 2,095 per ounce for increased compared to the prior quarter, primarily to a more operating waste stuns as phase s transitions from Capital waste into operating waste.\n\nWith that, I'll now pass the call over to William to discuss our projects.\n\nThanks. Claude as Paul noted. Our project pipeline is backed by a significant resource base of 26 million, oz of M&I, and an additional 13 million oz of infer, calculated at $2,000 per ounce.\n\nOur in-house technical team continues to focus on advancing these opportunities into our near- and longer-term production profile. We'll also leverage ongoing exploration to augment our broader resource base and support future production.\n\nWith the significant current resource base, strong exploration results, and the long-term optionality enhanced by current gold prices, we see a number of value-creating investment opportunities merging across the portfolio to leverage the strong gold price and enhance our production profile in the 2030s and beyond.\n\nWe continue to focus on extensive technical study disciplined investment and competition for Capital to ensure the projects. We approve have significant margin return and resilience\n\nWe will provide further information on these investment opportunities and decisions in q1 2026.\n\nAddress with our projects in the US and Canada.\n\nAt Bald Mountain, recent exploration and Technical, work has been progressing well to support and investment decision for Redbird 2 and has also confirmed opportunity to augment the production profile through concurrent satellite hip mining leveraging economies of scale and shared infrastructure at the site.\n\nAt rail. Mountain phase X underground project is well Advanced with underground development engineering, technical study work and permanent progressing to support a project decision in 2026\n\nIt's a similar story at Kuru, where engineering and technical studies on the high-grade resource that has been developed over the last few years are on track to support a project decision in 2026.\n\nWe will provide a separate update for Great Bear, where aex and Main project, engineering are progressing rapidly.\n\nThese are the projects alongside the continuation of our existing operations that support our potential to remain at 2 million oz through the end of the decade.\n\nReturning to our longer-term project pipeline for the 30s. Our resource base has significant optionality both for new projects with large resources, such as Loom, Marte, and Americana, and for further extensions of mine life at our existing operating assets.\n\nWe will be progressing a number of technical studies and permitting efforts across the high-quality portfolio over the next couple years. To advance the significant production potential for the 2030s we see at these assets.\n\nProvide some more detail on exploration, at Kuru in Washington. This year, we have been focused on infill drilling to support the early years of the mine plan.\n\nThe results of that work have been positive, confirming the strong wits and grades that we expected to see which are supportive of high margin underground. Mining potential.\n\nA few notable intersections from this last quarter included, 2 meters true width at 22 grams per tonne at the EVP Zone, and multiple intercepts of approximately 6, metres width, and 8 grams per tonne in the K5 Zone.\n\nWe also completed the initial development of the Roadrunner Decline and further extensions of the north stealth development, this quarter.\n\nThis will provide drill positions to explore for extensions of the high-grade resource at north south and to follow up on high-grade intercepts at Roadrunner, which is not currently in the resource for mine plan.\n\nWe will be focused on this resource extension, Drilling in Q4, 2025 and 2026.\n\nTurning to round Mountain phase X exploration, you can see in Q3 we focused on further, infill of the lower Zone with results, continuing to intersect strong grades and widths, proving out our exploration, thesis of a bulk tonnage underground lining opportunity.\n\nThe extensive infill drilling is now sufficient to support an initial underground resource estimate.\n\nOverall, our infill drilling results have been positive at Phase X supporting potential for a larger initial resource than we anticipated. When we made the decision in 2022 to advance this target.\n\nWe expect to release the initial resource estimate, alongside the project and economics update in q1 2026.\n\nAt Great Bear, both the AXE program and the main project are progressing well, and the main project remains on schedule for first production in 2029.\n\nStarting with updates on aex Earthworks, activities are well, Advanced as can be seen on this slide.\n\nThe natural gas pipeline is now complete and commissioned and the axe Camp is now operational.\n\nWater Treatment Plant building is enclosed with equipment. Installation currently ongoing.\n\nThe initial development of the portal box Cut is progressing. Well with the initiation of the exploration decline. Now forecast, commenced in the summer of 2026, pending receipt of provincial permits Jeff will comment further on permitting shortly.\n\nAs a reminder aex is not on the critical path for first production in 2029 but rather is focused on providing underground drill access for infill drilling of the underground resource and exploration drilling to further delineate extensions of mineralization at depth.\n\nWith respect to the main project which remains on track detailed engineering for key items such as the male Sales Management, Facility and other site. Infrastructure continues to progress. Well, with the 30% design review for the mill completed in Q3\n\nInitial procurement activities for major process of water. Treatment equipment, have commenced with contract Awards plan to start prior to year end.\n\nManufacturing of long lead items is expected to begin next year.\n\nI will now hand it over to Jeff to provide a brief update on Great Bear permitting and timelines.\n\nThanks will permitting of the aex program and the main project continued to advance as we work with the provincial and federal authorities,\n\nWe have 3 of the 5 permits required, including our closure forestry and Wildlife permits, which has enabled us to carry on significant acts activity.\n\nWe continue to work with the Ontario Ministry of environment, conservation, and Parks.\n\nMecp to finalize. The 2 remaining aex water permits that are required to manage contact water for exploration purposes, and in the interim,\n\nPermitted activities continue as planned.\n\nFor those who are not familiar. Contact water is primarily rain water that comes into contact with our site and naturally occurring underground water.\n\nOur first nation, Partners black Sul and wabaskang on Whose traditional lands the project resides continue to support the project and permitting.\n\nThese 2 outstanding permits are taking more time than anticipated as mecp consults with other First Nations.\n\nAs we'll noted axe, is not on the critical path for the main project timeline. Construction activities at the axe site will continue uninterrupted throughout the winter months as current activities and conditions do not require the use of water related permits.\n\nIn terms of the main project which remains on schedule, we continue to work with the impact assessment, agency of Canada to advance the project impact statement.\n\nThe first of 3 phase submissions for the Project's impact statement was filed in September with the second submission on track for filing in December.\n\nThe Final Phase is targeted to be submitted at the end of q1 of next year.\n\nWe also continue to advance our Iva negotiations with black soul and whisking First Nations and the Northwest matey community.\n\nI will now turn it back to Paul for closing remarks.\n\nThanks Joe.\n\nAfter another strong quarter, we are well positioned to meet our market commitments again this year.\n\nLooking forward. We are excited about our future.\n\nWe have a strong production profile.\n\nWe are generating significant free, cash flow.\n\nWe have an excellent balance sheet.\n\nWe have an attractive return of capital through both the dividend and share buybacks.\n\nWe have an exciting organic pipeline.\n\nAnd we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in sustainability.\n\nWith that operator. I'd like to open up the line for questions.\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question at this time, simply press star followed by the number 1 on your telephone keypad."

My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kinross Gold Second Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to David Shaver, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid C. Shaver\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development\n\nThank you, and good morning. In the room with us today on the call, we have Paul Rollinson, CEO; and from the Kinross senior leadership team, Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, Will Dunford and Geoff Gold.\nFor a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 3 of this presentation, our news release dated July 30, 2025, the MD&A for the period ended June 30, 2025, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will discuss our second quarter results, provide high-level updates across our portfolio, comment on sustainability and confirm our outlook. I will then hand the call over to the team to provide more detail.\nFollowing a good Q1, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, establishing an excellent first half and positioning us well to achieve our full year guidance. Our production in the second quarter was on plan, delivering 513,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,074 per ounce. Our strong production and cost management, combined with the gold price, resulted in record operating margins. As a result, we also delivered record free cash flow in the second quarter of almost $650 million and a first half total of just over $1 billion.\nOur financial position and cash flow outlook remains excellent, and we plan to continue to return meaningful capital to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases and our quarterly dividend.\nWith respect to our operations, Paracatu and Tasiast together accounted for more than half of our production and contributed significant cash flow. Paracatu delivered another strong quarter and was the highest producer in the portfolio, generating substantial cash flow. At Tasiast, we delivered our budgeted production in the second quarter. The mill has been performing well and the site remains on track to meet its full-year guidance. At La Coipa, despite encountering some excess groundwater in the pits, production was higher quarter-over-quarter and the site remains on track to meet its full year production guidance.\nOur U.S. assets delivered strong production and costs as planned. In Alaska, we saw another quarter of contributions from both Fort Knox and Manh Choh that were on plan. In Nevada, we saw stronger production from both Bald Mountain and Round Mountain. At Bald Mountain, mining activity for Phase 1 of Redbird is progressing well and study work for Phase 2 is ongoing. At Round Mountain, initial production from the Phase S open pit has commenced and is expected to ramp up throughout the year and into next. At Phase X, underground development is progressing well and we continue to see strong exploration results.\nAll of our projects continue to progress well in Q2. Our brownfields projects at Curlew and Phase X both had positive exploration updates and are showing potential to contribute to our production profile later in the decade and beyond. The greenfields projects at Great Bear and Lobo also progressed well and are expected to contribute to our production in 2029 and 2031, respectively.\nAlso, in the current gold price environment, we are seeing value-generating investment opportunities across our portfolio that capitalize on our significant resource base and our recent positive drill results. We see opportunities to extend mine life while maintaining our focus on margins and shareholder value. The team will comment on our resource optionality later.\nTurning now to a few remarks on sustainability. Our annual sustainability report was published earlier in May. It is a comprehensive document, which I encourage you all to review. Also, in Q2, we made progress across various water management initiatives, which remains a key focus area within our approach to sustainability. For example, at La Coipa, we enhanced water efficiency through an optimization program to reduce the amount of water loss going to our dry stack tailings. In Alaska, at Fish Creek, a historic mining area that Kinross did not operate, but later reclaimed for the benefit of the environment and local communities, fish populations continue to thrive.\nTurning now to our outlook. Following a strong second quarter and first half, we have produced just over 1 million ounces at a cost of sales in line with our guidance. Looking ahead, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full-year guidance. We will continue to maintain our financial discipline and prioritize margins to drive strong cash flow, which will support ongoing return of capital and further strengthen the balance sheet.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. This morning, I will review our financial highlights from the quarter, provide an update on our balance sheet and return of capital program and comment on our guidance and outlook.\nAs Paul noted, we had a strong second quarter. We produced 513,000 gold equivalent ounces with sales of 508,000 ounces. Cost of sales was $1,074 per ounce, and with an average realized gold price of $3,285 per ounce, we delivered record margins of just over $2,200 per ounce. Cost of sales of $1,074 per ounce increased from Q1, largely due to higher royalties. Higher sustaining capital expenditures also contributed to higher all-in sustaining costs compared to Q1.\nIn Q2, our adjusted earnings were $0.44 per share and adjusted operating cash flow was $844 million. Attributable CapEx was $302 million, split relatively evenly between sustaining and growth. Attributable free cash flow was a record $647 million, or $542 million excluding changes in working capital.\nTurning to our balance sheet, which remains in excellent shape and continued to strengthen in Q2. We ended the quarter with just over $1.1 billion in cash and approximately $2.8 billion of total liquidity, both increasing from Q1. We improved our net debt position to approximately $100 million at the end of Q2 and expect to be at net cash in Q3.\nIn Q2, we repurchased and canceled approximately $170 million in shares and subsequently have completed another $55 million for a total of $225 million to date. Including our quarterly dividend, we have returned almost $300 million to shareholders so far, and we're on track for our minimum target of $650 million this year. As we look forward, we expect to continue to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders while also strengthening our balance sheet with a view to repaying our $500 million 2027 notes.\nTurning to our guidance. Following the first half, we remain solidly on track to produce 2 million ounces at a cost of sales of $1,120 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of $1,500 per ounce. Production over the 2 remaining quarters this year is expected to be relatively even at approximately 500,000 ounces each to deliver our full year production guidance.\nOperating costs are budgeted to increase in the second half to meet our full year cost guidance. The expected increase is due to the following reasons: first, planned mine sequencing with costs expected to increase at several sites as we transition from capitalized stripping into operating waste; second, some expected inflation as we progress through the rest of the year; and third, slightly stronger production in the first half, providing a favorable denominator on fixed costs with production in the remaining quarters expected to deliver our guidance of 2 million ounces.\nTotal capital expenditures remain on track to meet guidance of $1.15 billion with a slightly higher weighting towards sustaining versus growth capital for the second half of the year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nClaude J. S. Schimper\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrea. In the second quarter, our safety programs continue to be focused on proactive identification of hazards, people development and leadership training. We have continued to roll out our new safety brand, Safeground, which has included co-design of site-specific and culturally-relevant communication plans of key messages. Our operations continued their strong performance in the second quarter, delivering production of 513,000 ounces with strong contributions across the portfolio.\nStarting with Paracatu, the mine had another steady quarter with strong production driving significant cash flow. Production of 149,000 ounces increased over the prior quarter due to the higher throughput and strong mill recoveries. Our cost of sales of $958 per ounce was in line with the previous quarter. Paracatu remains on track to meet its guidance, producing 585,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,025 per ounce.\nAt Tasiast, we delivered budgeted production in the second quarter, producing 119,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $843 per ounce. Budgeted production was achieved through strong mill performance and recoveries. Pre-stripping of the Fennec satellite pit to the north has also commenced in the second quarter. Tasiast remains on track to meet its production guidance of 500,000 ounces at a target cost of sales of $860 per ounce for the year.\nAt La Coipa, we produced 54,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,397 per ounce in the second quarter. Ore tonnes mined were lower over the prior quarter due to higher-than-anticipated groundwater inflows into the pits, resulting in higher tonnes processed from lower grade stockpiles and leading to higher costs in the second quarter.\nThe team has gained a good understanding of the input water conditions and increased dewatering and made adjustments to the mine plan. Production is expected to be stronger and costs lower in the second half of the year, mining transitions to the planned higher grades from Phase 7 ore. La Coipa remains on track to meet its full year production guidance of 230,000 ounces.\nMoving to our U.S. operations. Production was higher quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from strong contributions from Fort Knox and Manh Choh in Alaska and stronger grades in Nevada. Collectively, the U.S. sites delivered production of 190,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,229 per ounce in the second quarter. Our U.S. operations remain on track to meet its guidance of 685,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,420 per ounce.\nAt Fort Knox, second quarter production of 98,000 ounces was in line with our first quarter. Cost of sales of $1,247 per ounce was slightly higher over the prior quarter due to higher processing costs. At Bald Mountain, we produced 54,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,095 per ounce, improving over the prior quarter due to stronger grades as we were finishing mining at higher-grade LBM pit. Cost of sales of $1,095 per ounce was lower quarter-over-quarter due to the higher ounces sold and a higher proportion of capitalized costs as mining at Redbird Phase 1 continues to ramp up.\nAt Round Mountain, production of 39,000 ounces increased over the prior quarter due to higher grades. Cost of sales of $1,376 per ounce decreased from the prior quarter.\nWith that, I will now pass the call over to William to discuss our project.\n\nWilliam D. Dunford\n\nSenior Vice-President of Technical Services\n\nThanks, Claude. We continue to leverage our strong in-house technical team to advance optionality across our large resource base consisting of 26 million ounces measured and indicated and an additional 13 million ounces of inferred resource calculated at $2,000 per ounce.\nOur technical team is focused on drilling, technical studies and permitting to advance resources into our production profile, while also conducting exploration aimed at identifying new opportunities to augment our resource base.\nHere, you can see updates on a few areas of our resource base. Starting in Chile, at La Coipa, study and permitting work is progressing well for the oxide extensions. In Q2, we submitted our impact assessment, initiating the agency review process for permits to continue mining the next layback at Puren, which sits in our resource. We are already mining an open pit at Puren today, and pending permits, we plan to extend mining through the end of the decade with this next layback of the pit.\nAt Lobo-Marte, the project team continues to advance technical work as well as baseline studies to support our EIA. Project update will be provided with our year-end results.\nAt Bald Mountain, technical studies, optimization work and detailed engineering for the Redbird Phase 2 extensions are ongoing. Recall, Phase 2 would bring in an additional 680,000 ounces to the mine plan beyond Phase 1 and extend production out to at least 2031. In addition, we are also progressing drilling, technical work and studies across multiple smaller quick payback satellite pit opportunities at Bald that sit in our resource and could augment the Redbird Phase 2 production profile.\nProlific land package at Bald with over 40 historic open pits on the property continues to provide strong targets for mine life extensions and is a focus for our exploration and technical teams.\nMoving to Curlew. Drilling in Q2 continued to highlight strong grades and widths, further improving the quality of the project and showing potential for high-margin underground production. This drilling included intersections of approximately 6 meters true width at 14 grams per tonne at Stealth and approximately 5 meters true width at 12 grams per tonne at K5. We have seen impressive growth of the resource size, quality and grade over the last few years at Curlew, and with these exploration results, we continue to see potential for further high-value extension.\nThe underground development has advanced over 800 meters as we extend our decline at depth towards our 2023 discovery at Roadrunner and along Strike at Stealth to target further extensions of high-grade mineralization. Technical studies and detailed engineering are also progressing well. The resource and project update for Curlew will be provided with our 2025 year-end results.\nAt Phase X, development of the underground exploration decline continues to advance with over 4,500 meters developed to date. Infill drilling is also progressing well with good coverage now extending across both the upper and lower target zones. The results are again showing good grades and widths in both areas, further increasing confidence in our initial exploration thesis of a bulk mining target at Phase X.\nYou can also see on the slide, holes DX 162 and 163, which were extension holes drilled down dip of our primary exploration target. With width in excess of 60 meters and grades of around 3 grams per tonne, the results of these extension holes show continuation of mineralization outside of the original target area.\nBeyond the exciting exploration results, engineering work and technical studies to support project execution of a potential underground mine in the main target area are also advancing well, including development of the underground mine design and schedule, extensive geotechnical studies and studies for a paste backfill facility. The completion of the ongoing drill program and technical work will support a planned initial underground resource estimate and a project update for Phase X as part of our year-end results update.\nAt Great Bear, work on the AEX program and Main Project is progressing well. We've made significant progress on construction with the AEX camp nearing completion and earthwork activities in the portal area well advanced. You can also see on the slide that the drop cut for the portal area has advanced well with the high wall for the underground exploration decline now exposed with ground support already in place. We are excited by the progress to date and remain on track to start the initial development of the exploration decline by year-end, subject to permitting.\nFor the Main Project, detailed engineering for all site infrastructure is continuing to advance, including key items such as the mill and tailings facility. Initial procurement activities for major process equipment have begun, with awards planned to start later this year and manufacturing of a few long lead items expected to begin next year.\nI will now hand it over to Geoff to provide a brief update on Great Bear permitting.\n\nGeoffrey P. Gold\n\nExecutive VP of Corporate Development & External Relations and Chief Legal Officer, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Will. Permitting of the AEX program and Main Project continue to advance as we work with the provincial and federal authorities. For AEX, we have the permits we need for our current activities and expect to receive our 2 remaining water permits in the near term.\nIn terms of the Main Project, we continue to work with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada to advance the project impact statement. In order to advance the statement on a timely basis, we are coordinating with this federal agency on a staged filing process. We intend to file the majority of the technical chapters by year-end and the remaining chapters by the end of Q1 2026. This approach will underpin a robust impact statement filing with the necessary technical and indigenous contributions and to help facilitate an efficient review process.\nWe also continue to advance our IBA negotiations with Lac Suel and Wabauskang on whose traditional territory the project resides. Lac Suel and Wabauskang are progressing their independent project impact assessment work, which will help facilitate federal and provincial permitting on the Main Project and the completion of the IBA.\nI will now turn it back to Paul for closing remarks.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Geoff. After another strong quarter and a great first half of the year, we are well positioned to meet our targets in 2025. Looking forward, we are excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant free cash flow. We have an excellent balance sheet. We have an attractive return of capital through both the dividend and share buybacks, we have an exciting organic pipeline, and we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in sustainability.\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

My name is Ian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kinross Gold First Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nI would like to hand the call over to David Shaver, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid C. Shaver\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development\n\nThank you, and good morning. In the room with us today on the call, we have Paul Rollinson, CEO; and from the Kinross senior leadership team, Andrea Freeborough; Claude Schimper; Will Dunford; and Geof Gold.\nFor a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 3 of this presentation, our news release dated May 6, 2025, the MD&A for the period ended March 31, 2025, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will discuss our first quarter results, provide high-level updates across our portfolio, comment on sustainability, and confirm our outlook. I will then hand the call over to Andrea, Claude, and Will to provide more detail.\nFollowing outstanding performance in 2024, we continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter. Our culture of technical excellence and financial discipline, complemented by our consistent operating performance, continues to drive significant margins and cash flow for our business. Our financial position and cash flow outlook remains excellent. And as a result, we are enhancing capital returns for shareholders. Q1 was a great start to the year with production of 512,000 ounces.\nTasiast and Paracatu had another notable quarter and together accounted for more than half of our production and drove significant cash flow. Tasiast saw strong output in Q1, supported by strong grades and recoveries. Claude will elaborate further, but after a brief shutdown due to a fire in April, the mill was recently restarted, and Tasiast remains on track to meet its original full year guidance. Paracatu delivered another excellent quarter on the back of strong grades and improved mill recoveries. La Coipa and our U.S. assets also delivered production and costs as planned.\nTurning now to updates on our projects. Our in-house technical and project execution teams made notable progress in Q1 across our pipeline of mine life extensions and growth projects that underpin our long-term production profile.\nAt Curlew, ongoing resource drilling is returning exciting results with recent assays demonstrating substantial grades and widths supporting future high-margin production. At Round Mountain, underground development at Phase X is advancing well. And as outlined in our news release, we are continuing to see strong exploration results from infill drilling. At Lobo-Marte, baseline studies to support the project EIA are progressing well. At Great Bear, the advanced exploration program continues with construction and earthworks underway. Regarding the main project, we continue to advance our permitting efforts, working with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, and we've also kicked off detailed engineering on the mill and site infrastructure to advance the main project towards construction.\nTurning now to sustainability. I am pleased to say that our annual sustainability report will be published later this month. This comprehensive report, which is in its 17th edition provides an update on all the progress we made in 2024 and what we aim to accomplish this year and beyond.\nIt's an impressive document, which I encourage you all to review.\nMoving to our outlook. Following a strong first quarter, we are firmly on track to achieve our production, cost, and capital guidance for the year. As we did last year and in Q1, we will continue to maintain our financial discipline and prioritize cost management in order to deliver strong margins and cash flow. With this positive outlook, I am pleased to say that in addition to our dividend, we have enhanced our return of capital by reactivating our share buyback. This should provide a substantial year-over-year increase in return of capital to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. This morning, I will review our financial highlights from the quarter, provide an overview of our balance sheet and return of capital plans, and comment on our outlook. As Paul noted, we had a strong start to the year in Q1. We produced 512,000 gold equivalent ounces and sold 506,000 ounces. As per plan, Q1 cost of sales of $1,038 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,355 per ounce were lower than our guidance for the year.\nQ1 costs were also lower than the prior quarter, benefiting from more ounces produced, lower energy, and lower maintenance costs. Q1 margins were strong at over $1,800 per ounce, increasing over the prior quarter and outpacing the increase in the gold price. In Q1, our adjusted earnings were $0.30 per share, and adjusted operating cash flow was $676 million. Attributable CapEx was $204 million, with higher spending expected for the rest of the year to conform with our annual guidance.\nAttributable free cash flow was $371 million or $472 million, excluding changes in working capital. Free cash flow in Q1 was lower compared to the prior quarter, as expected, due to annual tax payments in Brazil and Mauritania.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our financial position continued to improve in Q1. Following the repayment of the final $200 million on our term loan, we ended the quarter with $695 million in cash and approximately $2.3 billion of total liquidity, both increasing from year-end.\nWe improved our net debt position to $540 million and our trailing 12-month net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.2x compared to 0.3x as of year-end. With the term loan now fully repaid and our strong cash balance at the end of Q1, we are increasing our returns to shareholders. Our quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share remains in place. In addition, we have reactivated our share buyback program and to date, have repurchased $60 million in shares. Based on recent gold prices, we are aiming to repurchase a minimum of $500 million of our common shares this year, which would increase our total return of capital to $650 million, representing an increase of over 300% compared to last year.\nOur shares continue to represent an attractive use of excess cash given our favorable relative valuation and strong free cash flow metrics. With our strong cash flow outlook, we expect to continue returning a substantial amount of capital to shareholders while also building cash on the balance sheet with a view to repay the $500 million 2027 notes at or before maturity. At today's gold prices, we expect to be in a net cash position by the end of the year.\nLastly, during the quarter, Moody's performed their annual review, revising our outlook to positive from stable and reaffirming our investment-grade credit rating.\nTurning to our guidance. We remain to produce 2 million ounces at a cost of sales of $1,120 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of $1,500 per ounce. Operating costs are expected to increase throughout the rest of the year for 3 reasons. First, stripping costs at Round Mountain Phase S and Fort Knox Phase 10 are currently being capitalized, and we expect both to be characterized as operating costs for accounting purposes from mid-year.\nSecond, we continue to expect inflation in the range of 3% to 4% on average for the year. And third, we had slightly stronger production in Q1, providing a favorable denominator on fixed costs, with production in the remaining quarters expected to deliver our annual guidance of 2 million ounces. Capital expenditures remain on track to meet guidance of $1.15 billion.\nI will now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nClaude J. S. Schimper\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrea. Delivery of our safety excellence program has now been completed, including at the corporate office, and refresher training has begun at some sites. In the first quarter, we placed significant focus on our leading safety practices. We conducted 54 operational learning teams and over 28,000 field engagements. This quarter, our operations continued their strong performance, delivering production of 512,000 ounces.\nStarting with Tasiast, mine delivered strong results in the first quarter with production of 138,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $811 per ounce. Tasiast performed well during the quarter, driven by strong grades and recoveries following a variety of optimization initiatives in the mill. Production was lower over the prior quarter due to lower throughput as we continue to work through enhancements to improve recoveries. Following the fire incident in mid-April, I'm pleased to see how effectively our site team responded to quickly restart the mill. With critical spare parts already on site, the site team was able to expedite repairs, reducing the downtime and mitigating the impact to production.\nWith the strong mining rates we saw in the first quarter, Tasiast was tracking ahead of its mine plan, allowing for the accumulation of high-grade material. Processing of this high-grade material has commenced and is expected to offset production that was budgeted from lower-grade stockpiles this year. Tasiast is still expected to deliver its production guidance of 500,000 ounces at a target cost of sales of $860 per ounce this year.\nParacatu delivered another solid quarter with production of 147,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $951 per ounce. Production increased over the prior quarter due to the strong grades and the timing of ounces processed. The quarter also saw strong production on the back of improved recoveries, which are benefiting from our continuous improvement initiatives, including the recent implementation of an additional gravity circuit at the plant. The site team were able to mitigate the impacts from the significant rainfall experienced in the first quarter, delivering on budget.\nProduction at Paracatu is expected to be higher and costs lower this year as mining continues within the high-grade portion of the pit. Paracatu remains on track to meet its guidance of 585,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,025 per ounce. At La Coipa, we produced 52,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,147 per ounce in the first quarter. Production was lower over the prior quarter, mainly due to the timing of ounces processed through the mill and lower planned throughput, partially offset by higher grades from the Puren deposit.\nLa Coipa is on track to meet its guidance of 230,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,060 per ounce in 2025.\nMoving to our U.S. operations. Production in the first quarter was as planned. Collectively, the U.S. sites delivered first quarter production of 176,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,246 per ounce. At Fort Knox, first quarter production of 94,000 ounces was higher over the prior quarter as a result of higher processing grades and higher recoveries from Manh Choh ore, driving strong free cash flow.\nOre tonnage from Manh Choh was higher than budgeted in the first quarter due to the timing of and some improvements in the ore transport system. With stronger volumes in the first quarter, the remaining campaigns this year are expected to see slightly lower average tonnages than the 200,000 to 220,000 tonnes per campaign that was outlined at year-end.\nAt Bald Mountain, we produced 46,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,123 per ounce. Production was in line over the prior quarter, while costs were slightly lower due to higher capitalized mining costs. At Redbird, mining activity for Phase 1 commenced in January and is advancing on schedule. At Round Mountain, production of 36,000 ounces was lower compared to the prior quarter due to the mine sequencing as mining transitions from the end of Phase W into Phase S stripping. Cost of sales of $1,585 per ounce was lower due to the lower consumable costs. Mining at the Phases open pit remains on schedule, with stronger production contributions expected towards the end of the year.\nWith that, I'll now pass the call over to William to discuss our projects.\n\nWilliam D. Dunford\n\nSenior Vice-President of Technical Services\n\nThanks, Claude. As highlighted last quarter, we have significant optionality from a number of mine life extensions and growth projects that sit in our resource base and underpin our potential future production profile. Our strong internal technical team is focused on drilling, technical studies, and permitting across the pipeline of growth projects to advance them into our production profile while also progressing exploration to bring new projects into our resource.\nHere, you can see updates on a few of those studies that our team is working on. At La Coipa, study and permitting work is progressing well for the oxide extension opportunities. The extensions being permitted are primarily focused on an additional open pit layback at Puren, an area where we are already mining today. At Bald Mountain, technical studies optimization work, and detailed engineering for Phase 2 is progressing well. Phase 2 would bring in an additional 680,000 contained ounces to the mine plan and extend production out to 2031. We expect to complete our technical work to support an execution decision by year-end at Redbird.\nAt Tasiast, we are progressing both drilling and technical studies to support mine life extensions beyond 2035 through optionality that we can see in our resource, which includes 2.4 million ounces of M&I and 1.6 million ounces of inferred. We are working on both open pit and underground extension options at West Branch, where our mineralization clearly extends at depth alongside exploration for satellite mining targets on the wider property. At Lobo-Marte, baseline studies to support our EIA are progressing well. We are also progressing technical work and will provide a project\n[Audio Gap]\nMoving to Curlew. Drilling in Q1 continued to highlight wider and higher grade zones of mineralization, further improving the quality of the project and showing potential for high-margin production. For example, at Stealth, we intercepted 10 meters at 16 grams per tonne, and at K5, we intercepted 26 meters at 8 grams per tonne. Technical studies and detailed engineering are progressing well to support a potential restart of operations at Curlew using our Kettle River processing facility.\nUnderground development was also reinitiated in Q1 to extend our decline at depth towards Roadrunner and along strike itself to target further extensions of high-grade mineralization. You can see on the slide, we are extending our development along a paleosurface that controls our productive horizon and has produced multiple historic mines, but has been underexplored at depth, providing potential for further extension of mineralization. We expect to provide a resource and project update for Curlew with our 2025 year-end results.\nAt Phase X, underground development continues to advance with over 3,900 meters developed to date. Infill drilling is also progressing well. And as you can see on the slide, we now have good coverage of the upper target zone and are focused on expanding coverage in the lower zone. The table on the slide shows all the results from Q1 in the lower zone. As you can see, the grades and widths further reinforce our exploration thesis of a bulk 3 to 4 gram per tonne deposit at Phase X. The completion of this drill program will put us in a position to provide an initial underground resource estimate and a project update for Phase X with our 2025 year-end results. In parallel, we are progressing technical studies and detailed engineering to support project execution.\nMoving to Great Bear. AEX surface works are progressing, including excavation for the decline infrastructure and construction of pads for the camp and stockpiles. Detailed engineering is nearly complete for AEX, and our procurement is advancing in line with the construction schedule. We remain on track to start the underground decline later this year, subject to permitting. For the main project, we have initiated detailed engineering for the mill and other critical site infrastructure and are continuing to advance our permitting efforts.\nI will now turn the call back to Paul for closing remarks.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Will. After a strong start to the year, we are well-positioned to meet our targets in 2025. Looking forward, we are excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We're generating significant free cash flow. We have an excellent balance sheet. We have an attractive return of capital through a dividend and share buybacks. We have an exciting organic pipeline, and we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in sustainability.\nAnd with that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

My name is Prila, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kinross Gold Fourth Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the conference over to David Shaver, Senior Vice President of Kinross Gold. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Shaver\n\nThank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, CEO; and from the Kinross Senior Leadership team; Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, Will Dunford and Geoff Gold.\nFor a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 3 of this presentation, our news release dated February 12, 2025, the MD&A for the period ended December 31, 2024, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Rollinson\n\nThanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. Highlight our operations, projects and provide an outlook for the business going forward and make a few comments on our achievements in sustainability. I will then hand the call over to Andrea, Claude and Will to provide more detail.\nWith respect to Q4, we delivered a strong quarter, producing just over 500,000 ounces. With respect to the full year, once again, we achieved our market commitments, delivering over 2.1 million ounces. We also delivered on our full year cost of sales and all-in sustaining cost guidance, which demonstrates our strong focus on rigorous cost discipline.\nAs a result, we generated record free cash flow of more than $1.3 billion, which more than doubled against the prior year. This record cash flow generation also benefited from strong operating margin on, which outpaced the relative increase in the gold price.\nOur operating margins increased by 37% compared to a 23% increase in the realized gold price, maximizing the benefit of the gold price for our company. With respect to our operations, our 2 largest assets: Tasiast and Paracatu, were both standouts.\nTogether accounting for approximately 1.2 million ounces or more than half of our production. Tasiast had an exceptional year, delivering record annual throughput, production and cash flow and once again was our highest margin operation in the portfolio. Paracatu delivered a full year production exceeding the midpoint of guidance and exceeding 500,000 ounces for the seventh consecutive year. At La Coipa, we delivered our full year production guidance as work continues on long-term optimization of the mill. And our U.S. operations, we had another solid year with production and costs on plan.\nTurning now to updates on our projects. In 2024, we continue to make excellent progress across our pipeline. In particular, we reached an important milestone at Great Bear with the release of the PEA in September. With the PEA, we have confirmed the top-tier potential of this asset an estimated average annual production of approximately 500,000 ounces at an impressive all-in sustaining cost of approximately $800 per ounce.\nThe Great Bear advanced exploration program, we have received all the necessary permits for our current activities, and we expect to receive the 2 remaining permits when they are required later in the year. The early works activities, including tree clearing and earthworks commenced prior to year-end and construction of the exploration decline is planned to commence later this year. Regarding permitting for the main project, we continue to work with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, and we plan to file the impact statement later this year.\nAt Round Mountain, underground development at Phase X is progressing well with over 3,300 meters developed to date and 21 kilometers of drilling completed last year. As outlined in our news release, we are continuing to see strong exploration results from Phase X, reaffirming our vision for a high productivity and low-cost underground mining operation.\nAt Bald Mountain, we have unlocked additional value from the approximate 4 million-ounce resource base with the conversion of nearly 1 million ounces into reserves. This conversion marks an important first step in extending the mine life of Bald, where we now see a strong case to proceed with initial mining at the Red Bird pit.\nWe are proceeding with a disciplined approach, expecting that Red Bird could ultimately extend production from Bald through 2031. Will is going to discuss more on this opportunity later. We also continue to advance work on Curlew in Washington State and Lobo-Marte in Chile.\nBefore moving to our outlook, I'd like to comment on our year-end reserve and resource pricing update. Given the stronger prevailing gold price environment, we have revised our gold price assumptions, which aligns with industry peers. Our reserves are now determined on a $1,600 per ounce gold price. Our resources on a $2,000 per ounce gold price. Although our price assumptions have moved higher, we are not planning to reduce the cutoff grades to our mills as our focus remains on maintaining strong margins.\nMoving to our outlook. We are reaffirming our stable multiyear production profile. Production of 2 million ounces for 2025 remains consistent with our previous guidance. As previously guided, based on mine plan sequencing, Production from Tasiast will be lower this year, and Paracatu remains on track to deliver higher production this year.\nLooking to 2026, our production outlook of 2 million ounces remains consistent with previous guidance. And we are introducing a new year of production of 2 million ounces for 2027. Beyond 2027, we expect production to remain around 2 million ounces through the end of the decade. Maintaining production at this level will be based on future production from our pipeline of project opportunities, which include Red Bird extensions at Bald, open pit extensions at La Coipa, Phase X underground at Round, Curlew in Washington State and Great Bear to round out the decade. We will continue to invest these initiatives and we plan to update you on our progress as we move forward.\nWith respect to capital allocation, in 2024, when we prioritized debt repayment and we have now fully repaid our $1 billion term loan. Our quarterly dividend remains in place as our baseline return of capital. In the current gold price environment, our business is generating significant cash flow. And if this current gold price holds, we are planning to return additional capital to shareholders later this year in the form of a share buyback. Andrea will speak more on this shortly.\nI'd like to comment on some of our achievements in sustainability. In 2024, we once again demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainability by operating responsibly and advancing our strategy across this important areas. In May, we will publish our 2024 sustainability report, which will provide a detailed review on our sustainability performance and initiatives throughout the year.\nSome highlights from this past year include: Completing more than 15 energy efficiency projects across the portfolio, placing us on track to achieve a 30% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030. We provided flood relief aid to communities in Brazil and Mauritania. We received a Sustainability Award from the Canadian Council for the Americas, and we were the top scoring gold company and top 10% overall in the Globe and Mail's Annual Corporate Governance Survey.\nLastly, I'd like to take a moment to thank Catherine McLeod-Seltzer for her significant contributions to Kinross and the Board over a 20-year directorship with Kinross. Catherine has been an independent Board member since 2005, and share of the Board since 2019. Catherine will be retiring from her role at our AGM in May, and we are pleased to announce Kelly Osborne will take on Catherine's previous role of independent Chair.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Freeborough\n\nThanks, Paul. This morning, I will review our financial highlights from the quarter and full year, provide an overview of our balance sheet and our capital allocation plans and discuss our guidance outlook. As Paul noted, we delivered production in line with guidance in 2024.\nFull year attributable production was 2.13 million ounces with production of 501,000 ounces in the fourth quarter. Q4 sales of 518,000 ounces were slightly above production due to timing. Cost of sales of $1,096 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,510 per ounce in the fourth quarter were higher compared to the prior quarter as expected, mainly due to lower planned production from Tasiast and Paracatu.\nFull year cost of sales of $1,021 per ounce and full year all-in sustaining costs of $1,388 per ounce were also in line with guidance. Margins were strong at $1,567 per ounce sold in Q4 and $1,372 per ounce for the full year. Our adjusted earnings were $0.20 per share in Q4 and $0.68 per share for the full year. Adjusted operating cash flow was $614 million in Q4 and approximately $2.1 billion for the full year. Attributable CapEx was $279 million in Q4 and $1.05 billion for the full year, in line with full year guidance. Attributable free cash flow was a record $434 million in Q4 and was also a record $1.34 billion for the full year.\nTurning to balance sheet. We ended the year with $612 million in cash and approximately $2.3 billion of total liquidity. We repaid an impressive $800 million against our term loan in 2024 and after making a subsequent repayment of $200 million, our $1 billion term loan has now been fully repaid. We have now fully paid for the acquisition of Great Bear on just the third anniversary with fewer shares outstanding than prior to the transaction.\nOver the last 24 months, we have reduced our net debt by approximately $1.4 billion and our net debt to EBITDA from 1.7x to 0.3x as of year-end. Our business has generated strong cash flow in the current gold price environment. And with the term loan now fully repaid, we are well positioned to consider additional return of capital to our shareholders. We are in the process of renewing our NCIB and based on recent gold prices, we expect to initiate a share buyback program later this year.\nAs typical for us, we expect Q1 to be a cash outflow quarter, in addition to the $200 million term loan repayment that we made in February. We also have our annual income tax payments in Brazil and now Mauritania and our semiannual interest payments. As such, we'll provide an update on our return of capital plans with our Q1 results in May.\nTurning to our guidance and outlook. As Paul noted, we're forecasting production in the range of 2 million ounces for 2025 remaining consistent with previous guidance. For costs, we're guiding $1,120 per ounce for cost of sales and $1,500 per ounce for ASIC. Cost of sales and ASIC are both up approximately 10% compared with 2024. The expected increase is driven by 3 factors, which mainly include structural changes to our portfolio this year.\nFirst, production guidance of 2 million ounces relative to 2.1 million ounces last year, resulting in a denominator impact on our fixed costs and on sustaining capital in the case of all-in sustaining costs.\nSecond, with the lower planned contribution from Tasiast this year, we will see a smaller benefit from our lowest cost mines.\nLast, modest overall cost inflation of 3% to 4%. Our capital expenditure guidance of $1.15 billion for 2025 reflects annual inflation and planned higher capital spend as we continue to advance Great Bear. Approximately $615 million of our total CapEx expected to be nonsustaining.\nLooking ahead to 2026, our production guidance of 2 million ounces remains unchanged from our guidance update last year. Beyond 2026, we have introduced another year of production guidance of 2 million ounces for 2027, in line with 2025 and 2026. Subject to ongoing inflation, attributable CapEx is expected to be consistent in 2026 and 2027 in order to continue to bring projects within our pipeline into production.\nI'll now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nClaude J. Schimper\n\nThank you, Andrea. In the fourth quarter, we officially launched our health and safety brand called Safeground and commenced work on establishing Safeground leadership development programs that will be tailored and delivered to 4 specific groups: executives, managers, frontline supervisors and operators.\nIn 2024, our operations delivered on our full year production and cost guidance. And we are encouraged to see our culture of operational excellence, continue to drive strong results from our operations. Production of 501,000 ounces in the fourth quarter [indiscernible] planned.\nStarting with Tasiast, the mine delivered a record throughput, production and cash flow. Record full year production of 622,000 ounces at an impressive cost of sales of $681 per ounce drove record free cash flow from our lowest cost operation.\nIn the fourth quarter, Tasiast delivered production of 139,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $725 an ounce. Production was lower over the prior quarter due to a planned reduction in grade. Production Tasiast is expected to be lower in 2025 as mine continues transitioning into lower grades. Tasiast is expected to deliver 500,000 ounces with the target cost of sales of $860 per ounce and is expected to be our lowest cost operation once again this year.\nParacatu delivered another strong year with production of 529,000 ounces exceeded midpoint of guidance and the cost of sales of $1,039 per ounce, which was below the midpoint of guidance. As planned, mine sequencing continued to transition into higher grades in the fourth quarter. Production of 124,000 ounces was low over the prior quarter as stronger grades were offset by lower throughput resulting from the timing of some mill maintenance and mine sequencing.\nProduction at Paracatu is expected to be higher and costs lower this year as mining continues within the higher grade portion of the pit. Paracatu is expected to produce 585,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,025 per ounce in 2025.\nAt La Coipa, fourth quarter production of approximately 59,000 ounces improved over the prior quarter on stronger mill throughput, which offset lower grades. Full year production of 246,000 ounces was in line with guidance. The site team continues to manage throughput while long-term mill optimization initiatives are being implemented. And La Coipa anticipated to produce 230,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,060 per ounce in 2025.\nMoving to our U.S. operations. Production was stronger in the second half of the year as expected, following the start of production from Manh Choh early in the third quarter. Collectively, the U.S. site delivered full year production of 731,000 ounces at a cost of sales $1,313 per ounce, which was in line with guidance. Production of 179,000 ounces in the final quarter was on plan.\nIn Alaska, fourth quarter production of 92,000 ounces was lower compared to the prior quarter and cost of sales of $1,320 per ounce was higher due to the timing of the processing of Manh Choh ore.\nAt Bald Mountain, we produced 45,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $1,144 per ounce. And production was in line over the prior quarter, while costs were slightly lower due to the timing of sales.\nAt Round Mountain, production of 43,000 ounces was in line compared to the prior quarter. Cost of sales of $1,764 per ounce was higher due to the accounting of higher cost ounces from the leach pads. Mining at the Phase X open pit remains on schedule with initial production expected to begin in the second half of the year.\nWith that, I'll now pass the call over to William to discuss our projects.\n\nWilliam Dunford\n\nThanks, Claude. We've just released our annual reserve and resource. So I'd like to start out by providing that update and then I'll discuss the growth projects that sit in our resource and underpin our potential future production profile.\nWe are currently in a phase where we are focused on drilling and developing our earlier stage, higher-grade growth projects like Great Bear, Phase X, Lobo-Marte and Curlew. As a result, the majority of our additions this year came in the inferred category where we saw a 1.7 million ounce increase. We did also see some additions in the M&I category, which were largely offset by conversion of 1 million ounces out of M&I into reserve at Bald Mountain. We have updated our reserve and resource gold price assumptions from $1,400 to $1,600 and from $1,700 to $2,000 respectively. The intention of this was to be more reflective of the current gold price environment.\nWith the increase in our gold price, we're taking a balanced approach and our objective was not to drop cut-off grades to grow resources. Instead, we are focused on margin and quality of our resource additions to extend our mine lives and bring on higher-grade growth projects, as you can see by the overall increase in resource grade.\nTo that end, you can see on this slide an overview of the significant resource optionality for both mine life extensions at our existing mines and new production from growth projects. With 26 million ounces in M&I and another 13 million ounces in inferred. These resources form the pipeline of potential opportunities that we are progressing to support our production profile through the end of the decade and into the 2030s.\nThis slide gives an indication of the level of study of these opportunities. We have our base case, which includes reserves and already approved projects and provides the production in our guidance window through 2027.\nSecond, we have several growth projects at an advanced stage of study that offer potential to add production both through the end of the decade and beyond into the '30s.\nAnd third, we have several opportunities within our project pipeline that are at an earlier stage of study and offer potential to contribute to our 2030s production profile. We remain excited about our internal prospects which are further augmented by today's strong gold price, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach progressing these projects into our production profile with a focus on margin and return.\nBald Mountain offers a recent example of bringing these pipeline opportunities into our production profile. In mid-2024, we received our permits for the Juniper package and on the back of this, we have converted approximately 1 million ounces of resource to reserve in the Red Bird pit. We have split Red Bird into 2 phases. We have approved and already started mining Phase 1, which contains 270,000 ounces and will take production into 2028.\nPhase 2, containing approximately 690,000 ounces of M&I could begin in 2026 and extend production from Bald Mountain through 2031. This phased approach lowers the initial CapEx and risk and pulls forward earlier production from Phase 1 into 2027, while we continue to optimize our desired execution plan for Phase 2. The initial CapEx of 120 million for Phase 1 is primarily pre-stripping costs as Phase 1 leverages the existing leach pad capacity, thereby minimizing our initial capital risk. Project has an all-in sustaining cost of $1,500 per ounce and a strong return at today's gold price.\nWe also continue to focus on additional optionality at Bald Mountain outside of Red Bird, including looking at small satellite pit opportunities that could be combined with Red Bird 2. At Tasiast, we have completed a new mine plan on the back of the 2024 reserve update. Tasiast's production over the next 3 years is expected to be lower, driven by mine plan sequencing and lower mill grades as we focus on stripping in West Branch 5. It has been a focus for the Tasiast's team to increase production in the '25 through '27 window through operational improvements, design optimizations and unlocking satellite opportunities. This work has added approximately 100,000 ounces over this 3-year period as compared to the mine plan update we provided in 2023. Optimization at Tasiast is ongoing with additional satellite opportunities being evaluated. Studies to explore underground potential are also progressing with recent drilling at West Branch intersecting wide mineralization, 700 meters down plunge of the existing resource.\nMoving from our operations to our growth projects. The Curlew team has been successful in adding high-quality resources over the last couple of years, further enhancing the potential of the project. As part of our year-end resource update, we are pleased to report a high-grade resource addition at Curlew. This is the addition of 125,000 ounces at 9 grams per tonne in the South Zone, which continues to be open both along strike and depth. Not only are we seeing strong grades in this zone, but it's also coming in at a very mineable width averaging just over 5 meters. This focus on high-grade extension in South will continue in 2025 with an expanded drill program target further extensions at depth.\nNow shifting focus to Phase X where development and drilling continues to progress well. We have now expanded drilling into the upper zone of the exploration target and you can see the results continue to support our thesis of a bulk underground operation in the range of 3 to 4 grams per tonne, providing potential for higher-margin supplemental production at Round Mountain. In 2025, we will be completing our initial infill drilling program at Phase X, and we anticipate the release of an initial underground resource with our '25 year-end resource update.\nAt Great Bear, early works construction for advanced exploration commenced in November. As can be seen on the slide, tree clearing is now complete, and earthworks for excavation for the exploration infrastructure has commenced. We are excited to have broken ground and are focused on progressing civil works and permitting over the coming quarters to allow us to start the exploration decline later this year.\nMoving to the broader exploration update. Our team had another strong campaign in 2024 with approximately 320 kilometers of drilling completed across MINEX, brownfields and greenfields. As detailed in our press release, this program produced notable results across several locations. We provided an update on Great Bear back in September, highlighting the successful addition of over 500,000 ounces of high-grade inferred resource at depth and the strong results of our PEA. We also highlighted the drilling at depth below the PEA inventory and resource that demonstrates the significant upside potential for further resource additions.\nFollowing the success of this 2024 drilling and the results of the PEA, we've shifted our focus at Great Bear to regional exploration work on the 120 square kilometer land package. We've already provided updates on Curlew and Phase X, so I will move on to our other U.S. assets.\nAt Fort Knox, the program focused on 2 main areas: growth around the Fort Knox pit around the [ Gill channel ]. We saw some good intercepts across both areas, indicating potential for additional mill feed and this work will be followed up on in 2025. At Bald Mountain, with near-term mine extensions established through the approval of Red Bird 1, the 2025 exploration campaign will focus on conversion of the inferred resource in Red Bird 2 and on generative projects.\nAt Tasiast, we added 110,000 ounces to reserves in 2024 through the addition of the Fennec Satellite pit. Exploration in 2025 will focus on further expanding mineralization at the underground target and drilling out additional satellite pit opportunities on the wider land package.\nMoving to Chile. Our Brownfields program further delineated porphyry mineralization, and in 2025, we will follow up on these results and also progress exploration of known trends on La Coipa license. In Brazil, our Brownfield program focused to testing targets along the Northwest corridor from Paracatu, with results showing similar style and grade of mineralization to the Paracatu deposit.\nMoving to our Greenfield program. Approximately 45 kilometers of drilling was completed on targets located in Canada, the U.S. and Finland. In Manitoba, our drilling Laguna continue to define high-grade share-hosted vein systems. And in 2025, we will focus on increasing the critical mass of mineralization to support further work.\nIn Nevada, drilling was completed across several prospective properties with the potential for Carlin and low-sulfidation gold mineralization. This drilling included an initial diamond drill hole, at the PWC JV project in September which successfully intersected lower plate carbonates associated with Cortez district at depth.\nIn Finland, we progressed both base of till drilling for target delineation and follow-up diamond drilling, which shows some high-grade intercepts at Launi East. In Finland, we will follow up on these successes in 2025 and continue our exploration of this underexplored Greenstone Belt.\nOverall, we are encouraged with our success identifying and progressing earlier-stage opportunities, such as Phase X, Curlew and Great Bear.\nI will now turn it back to Paul for closing remarks.\n\nJ. Rollinson\n\nThanks, Will. After delivering on our commitments in 2024, we are well positioned for a successful 2025. Our business is in great shape both operationally and financially with a number of key milestones for the year ahead, including: repayment of our term loan; pre-stripping at Red Bird; advancing permitting across Great Bear, Curlew, La Coipa and Lobo-Marte; advancing exploration decline infrastructure at Great Bear; reinstating our share buyback plan; initial production from Phase S; satellite mining at Fennec; and an anticipated year-end resource at Phase X.\nIn summary, we are excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant free cash flow, we have an excellent balance sheet, we have an attractive dividend and plan on returning additional capital, we have an exciting pipeline of both exploration and development opportunities. We're very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in sustainability.\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

My name is [ Jaylen ] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2024 results conference call and webcast. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn, the conference over to Chris Lichtenheldt, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nChris Lichtenheldt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, CEO, and from the Kinross Senior Leadership Team, Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, Will Dunford, and Geoff Gold.\nFor a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 2 of this presentation. Our news release dated July 31, 2024. The MD&A for the period ended June 30, 2024, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will discuss our Q2 margins and cash flow, provide high-level updates on our operations and projects, update you on our sustainability initiatives, and reaffirm our outlook. I will then hand the call over to Andrea, Claude, and Will to provide more detail.\nFollowing a strong start to the year in Q1, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, establishing an excellent first half and positioning us well to meet our full year guidance. In Q2, our operating margins grew by over 20% compared to the prior quarter, once again outpacing the relative increase in the gold price over the same period. As a result, free cash flow more than doubled in the second quarter, $346 million.\nThe first half total just under $0.5 billion. Now to operations. Production in the second quarter was on plan, delivering 535,000 ounces at a cost of sales of just over $1,000 per ounce.\n2 largest assets, Tasiast and Paracatu, both performed well in production and costs, improving over the prior quarter. Tasiast had an excellent quarter and was once again the highest margin mine in our portfolio, driving significant free cash flow.\nParacatu continued its consistent contribution with strong throughput and recoveries, helping drive a steady quarter of production and cash flow.\nAt La Coipa production remains on track for the full year and we continue to use strong mill grades and recoveries to optimize throughput in order to address some maintenance opportunities. In our U.S. operations, production was on plan, notably stronger performance from Fort Knox.\nTurning now to our development activities in the second quarter. At Round Mountain, the Phase S open-pit and the Phase X underground development work continues to advance well. Stripping at Phase S, and the expansion of the heap leach pad are progressing on schedule to support initial open-pit production next year.\nAt Phase X, the development of the exploration decline is progressing on plan. As outlined in our press release, we are excited that the expansion drilling at Phase X intercepted mineralization with strong grades and widths, outside of the primary exploration target.\nThese results demonstrate the potential for expansion of the primary resource target and are expected to support high productivity bulk mining.\nMoving to Alaska. Consistent with our guidance, I was recently at Fort Knox to celebrate the first gold ore from Manh Choh. This important milestone represents the hard work and dedication of our project team and partners to bring this hybrid mine into production, both on budget and on schedule.\nMining operations at Manh Choh are performing as planned, and the Fort Knox mill modifications are on track for final commissioning in Q3. As a result, we look forward to delivering several years of strong production at attractive costs from the combined operations in Alaska.\nAt Great Bear, we continue to make strong progress in the second quarter. The ongoing exploration drilling campaign continues to focus on targeted extensions to the resource at depth. And in Q2, we drilled the deepest hole on the property to date. This whole intersected attractive grades and widths at a vertical depth of nearly 1.6 kilometers down plunge of the main LP zone.\nThis intercept is outside of our current resource and demonstrate significant potential for further resource growth. Drilling at Hinge and Limb also returned attractive results for depth extensions in both zones, indicating strong upside potential to supplement the main LP zone from these satellites.\nIt's important to note that this recent deep drilling will not be reflected in the upcoming PEA because the PEA is a point-in-time estimate and will only include drilling up to April. The PEA will provide visibility on the open pit and a window into the initial production scale, cost and margins for the underground.\nGiven the depth of the mineralization, the long-term potential of the resource will need to be drilled off from underground as we progress development ahead of mining. However, this deep drilling to date shows the continuation of high-grade mineralization beyond the current resource in the PEA indicating the potential for significant resource growth over time.\nWe look forward to outlining more project details when we released the PEA in September. For the AEX, the start of surface construction is targeted for later this year. Regarding permitting for the Main Project, the federal impact assessment is underway.\nBaseline studies, permitting and engineering for both the AEX and Main Projects are all progressing well. In summary, we are very pleased with how things are progressing at Great Bear.\nBefore I make a few comments on sustainability, we would be remiss to not address the recent incidents that have occurred around heap leach facilities within the mining industry. Will is going to discuss why we are confident in the quality of our heaps in more detail later on this call.\nTurning now to sustainability. Last night, we published our fourth annual climate report, which provides our latest comprehensive climate-related disclosures. The report also outlines our progress towards our climate-related goals and provides details on our climate change strategy, including our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity.\nIn 2023, we implemented 15 energy efficiency projects across our sites with combined greenhouse gas reductions of more than 29 kilotons of CO2. As a result, our percentage of renewable energy increased 23% of total energy consumed last year.\nLooking forward, we are on track to achieve our targeted 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission intensity by 2030. In summary, we continue to be very proud of our work in the area of sustainability, and I encourage everyone to read our recent climate report to learn more.\nTurning now to our outlook. Year-to-date, we have produced over 1 million ounces at a cost of sales in line with our guidance. Looking ahead, we remain on track to achieve our production and cost guidance for the full year.\nOur continued focus on costs is driving strong margins and significant free cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. This morning, I'll review our financial highlights from the quarter, provide an overview of our balance sheet and comment on our guidance and outlook.\nOur second quarter performance was strong with production and cash flow exceeding the prior quarter. We produced 535,000 ounces with gold sales of 521,000 ounces. Cost of sales was $1,029 per ounce and with an average realized gold price of $2,342 per ounce, we delivered strong margins of over $1,300 per ounce. All-in sustaining cost was $1,387 per ounce.\nFirst half cost of sales of $1,006 per ounce is in line with our full year cost guidance range of $1,020 per ounce. First half all-in sustaining cost of $1,348 per ounce is also in line with our full year guidance range of $1,360 per ounce.\nIn Q2, our adjusted earnings were $0.14 per share and adjusted operating cash flow was $478 million, both improving over the prior quarter. We generated $346 million of attributable free cash flow in the quarter or $237 million, excluding working capital changes.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our financial position continued to improve in the second quarter and remained strong. After repaying $200 million of debt against the term loan in Q2, we ended the quarter with $480 million. We currently have approximately $2.1 billion of total liquidity.\nOver the past 12 months, we've reduced our net debt by approximately $450 million and our net debt to EBITDA from 1.3x last year to jumped under 0.8x as of Q2. Looking forward, we plan to continue allocating excess free cash generated against the remaining $800 million due on the term loan in 2025.\nTurning to our guidance. Following Q2, we remain solidly on track to meet our guidance to produce 2.1 million ounces at a cost of sales of $1,020 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of $1,360 per ounce.\nCapital expenditures are on track for our full year guidance of $1.05 billion, split roughly easily between sustaining and non-sustaining capital. I'll now turn the call over to Claude.\n\nClaude J. S. Schimper\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrea. In 2023, we launched our global Safety Excellence Program. And I'm pleased to say that we have now shared this program with over 60% of the workforce, including both employees and business partners. We are proud of the program's impact to date and look forward to continuing to share it with the rest of the organization.\nThis quarter, we remain focused on continuing to implement our human and organizational performance program and our operational lending teams. This program is improving our team collaboration and operationalizing by putting people first to core value.\nResults today are very positive, and it will continue to be a focus through the remainder of 2024. Moving on to our operations. We saw continued strong performance in Q2, with our mines delivering as planned in the quarter and the first half of the year.\nAt Tasiast, production of 162,000 ounces was higher quarter-over-quarter. The cost of sales of $656 per ounce, improving over the prior quarter. Tasiast was once again the lowest cost asset within the portfolio, driving significant free cash flow.\nFollowing a strong first half, Tasiast remains on track to meet its full year production guidance of 610,000 ounces. At Paracatu, production of 130,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $1,039 per ounce were unplanned and also improved over the prior quarter. The mine continues to see steady performance on throughput, grades and recoveries in line with the mine plan.\nMine sequencing continues to transition through the lower grade portions of the pit as planned before moving back into the higher grades by year-end into 2025. Paracatu remains on track to meet its 2024 production guidance of 510,000 ounces.\nAt La Coipa, Q2 production of 66,000 ounces was lower over the prior quarter, whilst cost of sales was higher mainly due to higher mill maintenance costs and timing of sales. Production at La Coipa remains on track for the full year target of 250,000 ounces as strong performance on grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. We continue to perform reliability and optimization work on the plant. As part of this work, the team is actively managing throughput levels to enhance the reliability of the plant, while the plant optimization continues.\nMoving to our U.S. operations. Production was higher quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from improved contributions from Fort Knox, while Round Mountain and Bald Mountain were lower as planned due to mine sequencing.\nBeginning with Fort Knox, production of 70,000 ounces was significantly higher compared to the prior quarter as mill throughput, deepish performance, grades and recoveries all improved.\nCost of sales of $1,345 per ounce was lower over the prior quarter, primarily due to the higher production. At Manh Choh, mining continues on schedule and more transportation has ramped up to planned volumes. Processing of Manh Choh ore began in early July and is tracking to plan. The full commissioning of the Fort Knox mill modifications is expected to be completed in Q3. At Bald Mountain, production of 46,000 ounces was slightly lower than the prior quarter as planned. Cost of sales of $1,271 per ounce was higher quarter-over-quarter.\nAt Round Mountain, production of 62,000 ounces was lower over the prior quarter due to lower mill throughput and grades as planned. The cost of sales of $1,564 per ounce was higher quarter-over-quarter due to the lower production. In Phase S, mining activity continues to progress as planned.\nMeanwhile, the heap leach pad expansion is progressing on schedule. Earthworks and procurements are all complete and the initial production from Phase S remains on track to begin in the second half of next year.\nWith that, I'll now pass the call over to William.\n\nWilliam D. Dunford\n\nSenior Vice-President of Technical Services\n\nThanks, Claude. I'll start out by providing a brief overview of our operating heap leach facilities before moving on to an update on our projects. We are currently operating heap leach facilities across 3 types in the U.S.\nAs Paul mentioned, we are confident in the quality and safety of our heap leach facilities for a few reasons. First off, our facilities are primarily run-of-mine heap leach pads, meaning they have larger rocks and crushed heap leach pads, which significantly reduces the risk of liquefaction and increases the structural stability of the pads. The only heap leach we have with crushing is Round Mountain, where we are only crushing a portion of the ore we are placing on the pads.\nSo overall, we still have larger rock sizing and a fully crushed pad. Second, topography. Both Round and Bald Mountain are built on relatively level ground rather than hillsides or valley fills, increasing their stability. Fort Knox is our only valley-fill heap leach operation. And again, the 2 pads there are 100% run-of-mine ore.\nFinally, it is also worth noting that the embedment of the toe of the valley pads at Fort Knox are designed, engineered, operated and monitored as dams based on state regulation in Alaska, which ensures strong governance on construction and stability.\nSo overall, we are confident in the quality of our heap leach facilities. And as always, we will maintain safety and environmental impact of these facilities as our top priority.\nMoving to updates at Round Mountain. At Phase X underground, the development of the exploration decline continues to progress well, with over 2.2 kilometers developed so far. Exploration drilling has also progressed well as we have started infill drilling as the primary Phase X target and continued opportunity drilling outside of the target to extend the mineralization.\nAs you can see on Figure 1 on the top of this slide, we have received multiple strong assay results on intercepts outside of the Phase X target. Of particular note, you can see in the bottom of Figure 2, an impressive intercept of approximately 30 grams per tonne over 32 meters above the lower portion of our primary exploration targets shown in purple.\nThere is also a link to a video on the slide and our press release that can give you a better sense of the location of these intercepts. We are pleased to see these results and confirmation of the potential to extend the mineralization that we are targeting for underground mining. We will continue our exploration program at Phase X through the remainder of this year and into next as we advance technical studies in parallel.\nMoving to Curlew Basin, exploration continued to advance in the second quarter. Results from the underground drill program continue to confirm thicker zones of high-grade mineralization near the cell zone where a recent assay returned approximately 14 grams per tonne over 19 years.\nDrilling from both surface and underground also continued on the Roadrunner vein zone, with the recent hole returning 12.5 grams per tonne over 2.4 meters. We are encouraged by these higher-grade results, which indicate potential to expand the resource and improve the overall resource quality.\nAt Great Bear, drilling continues to focus on demonstrating that high-grade mineralization continues well beyond our current resource. As Paul mentioned, in Q2, we drilled the deepest hole on the property to date. This hole returned 3.8 meters at a grade of 9.5 grams per tonne at nearly 1.6 kilometers vertical depth, demonstrating the impressive continuity of this system that will ultimately need to be drilled out from underground.\nDrilling in the second quarter also showed good grades and widths at depths well beyond our current resource at the Discovery Yaro, and Oro zones, as can be seen on this slide. Similar to Yuma, these zones continue to show potential for significant resource [ upside ] and growth at depth.\nLastly, drilling at Hinge and Limb this quarter has returned promising results for depth extensions at both zones. At Hinge, we had multiple strong intercepts at around 850 meters, including 9.3 grams per tonne over 3.1 meters and 22.7 grams per tonne over 3.1 meters. We are excited to be seeing confirmation of depth extensions to mineralization across the board at Great Bear, continuing to support our original thesis of a long-life, high-grade mining complex.\nMoving to a few other updates at Great Bear. Through the AEX decline, detailed engineering, execution planning and procurement continue to progress well. We are targeting a start of early works later this year and start of the underground decline in mid-2025. For the Main Project, in Q2, we continue to advance technical studies, field work and comprehensive baseline studies.\nBeyond the strong exploration results, we're encouraged to see the in-depth technical work continuing to show positive results across the board, including simple metallurgy, high recovery and competent geotechnical conditions. Work on the initial project PEA is well advanced, and we look forward to releasing these results from the study in early September. I will now turn the call back to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Will. Following a strong first half, our business remains in great shape and on track to deliver our full year commitments. There is much to look forward to for the remainder of the year and beyond that, we remain excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant cash flow. We have an investment-grade balance sheet that is continuing to strengthen. We have an attractive dividend.\nLooking forward, we have an exciting pipeline of both exploration and development opportunities, and we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in sustainability.\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, provide high-level updates across our portfolio, highlight some of our ESG achievements, and confirm our outlook. I will then hand the call over to Andrea, Claude, and Will to provide more detail.\nFollowing our strong performance in 2023, our operations continue to perform very well, and we are generating significant cash flow. The strong gold prices so far this year are providing a tailwind for our business, which continues to be underpinned by a focus on cost discipline, and margins. Our production in the first quarter was on plan, delivering 527,000 ounces. Tasiast, Paracatu, and La Coipa contributed just over 2/3 of our production at strong margins, with an ASIC below $1,000 per ounce. Our U.S. operations also performed well in the first quarter, delivering on-plan and remain on track for their full year targets.\nTurning now to our development activities in the first quarter. At Round Mountain, the Life of Mine Extension Strategy that we announced last year is advancing well. We are making significant progress at Phase S and with our underground opportunities at Phase X and Gold Hill. I was recently at Round Mountain and was very impressed by the progress at Phase X where we have completed approximately 1.8 kilometers of underground development. In Alaska, the Manh Choh project is proceeding well and is on schedule to contribute to production in early Q3.\nTransportation of ore to Fort Knox continues to ramp up, and the mill modifications remain on track. At Great Bear, we continue to make excellent progress across several work streams. We had a highly productive few months with nearly 38,000 meters of drilling completed. As outlined in yesterday's press release, drilling continues to return significant results extending beyond our year end resource update.\nIn addition to drilling, other areas of the project such as permitting and engineering for the advanced exploration decline are progressing well, as our technical studies permitting an engineering work on the main project. We are on track to release our results from the ongoing work in the form of a PEA in the second half of the year.\nI want to provide some additional context around the level of study we plan to release. The PEA will provide a more fulsome view of the project, including both the open pit and underground resource. Publishing a PEA allows us to include some of the underground inferred resources. This will provide better visibility into our anticipated path forward for both underground and open pit mining. While it will be a PEA level study, we are putting substantial effort into our capital and operating cost estimates to provide additional confidence on the ASIC and margins.\nIt is also important to note that our PEA will incorporate a subset of the ounces in our measured, indicated and inferred resources. It will not include the deeper mineralization that we will not yet have drilled sufficiently to bring into the inferred resources. Our deep drilling has shown that the mineralization continues to depth well below the current resource in attractive widths and grades. As we continue drilling out the underground and commence underground drilling from the AEX decline, we expect the ounces in the mine plan to continue to grow.\nOn permitting for the main project, the detailed project description was submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada in Q1. The federal impact assessment is underway and We expect to file our impact statement in the first half of next year.\nTurning to sustainability. Our long-standing annual sustainability report will be published later this month. This report, which is in its 16th edition, will provide a comprehensive update on the progress we made in 2023 and what we aim to accomplish this year and beyond.\nTurning to our outlook. Following a strong first quarter, we are on track to achieve our 2.1 million ounce of production and our cost guidance for this year. In light, of the recent strong gold prices, we will continue to maintain our financial discipline and prioritize margins. With respect to capital allocation, our plan is to use excess cash flow to repay debt. Our first quarter is setting up 2024 to be another strong year. We believe that delivering on our guidance, coupled with our strong free cash flow to continue to support strong share price performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. This morning, I will review our financial highlights from the quarter, provide an overview of our balance sheet, and comment on our guidance and outlook.\nAs Paul noted, we had a strong start to the year. We produced 527,000 ounces with gold sales of 522,000 ounces. We held our cost of sales in line with the prior quarter at $982 per ounce. With an average realized gold price of $2,070 per ounce, we delivered strong margins of $1,088 per ounce. ASIC of $1,310 per ounce was slightly lower, compared to the prior quarter on comparable cost of sales and lower sustaining capital.\nAverage realized gold prices since Q1 have been notably higher, driving strong ongoing margins and free cash flow. In Q1 our adjusted earnings were $0.10 per share and adjusted operating cash flow was $425 million. We generated a $145 million of attributable free cash flow in Q1 or $194 million excluding changes in working capital.\nTurning to the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong. We ended the quarter with $407 million in cash and approximately $2 billion of total liquidity. Our trailing 12 month net debt to EBITDA ratio also improved as of quarter end to just below 1x. At current gold prices, we expect our debt metrics to continue to improve throughout the year. As Paul mentioned, we plan to allocate excess free cash against the term loan due in 2025 and expect to start debt repayments this quarter.\nTurning to our guidance. Following Q1, we remain solidly on track to meet our guidance and produce 2.1 million ounces at a cost of sales of $1,020 per ounce and ASIC of $1,360 per ounce. Capital expenditures are on track for our full year guidance of $1.05 billion, split roughly evenly between sustaining and non-sustaining capital. Cash flow is expected to be stronger in the second half as a result of timing of tax payments made earlier in the year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Claude.\n\nClaude J. S. Schimper\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrea. We have achieved significant progress with the implementation of our Safety Excellence Program, which reached over 50% of employees and business partners globally. This year as part of our health and safety blueprint we are taking additional steps to further improve engagement across the global team with a focus on human and organizational performance and operational learning teams. We will continue rolling out this program globally and look forward to providing further updates over the coming quarters.\nMoving to our operations. We saw a strong performance in Q1 with our mines delivering the planned production for the quarter. At Tasiast production of 159,000 ounces was in line with the prior quarter with a cost of sales of $660 per ounce being the lowest in the portfolio. At the Tasiast solar plant, commissioning is now complete and the plant is generating power to full capacity. Tasiast remains on track to meet its 2024 production guidance of 610,000 ounces.\nThe Paracatu, production of 128,000 ounces, at a cost of sales of $1,059 per ounce, were both in line with the prior quarter. Production at Paracatu this year is expected to be lower and costs higher, compared to last year as mine sequencing continues to transition through the lower grade portions of the fixed before moving back into higher grades next year. Paracatu remains on track to meet its 2024 production guidance of 510,000 ounces.\nAt La Coipa, Q1 production of 71,000 ounces was on plan. The mine delivered strong free cash flow driven by higher margin production from a cost of sales of $733 per ounce, the second lowest in our portfolio. Production is tracking well against our plants, a strong performance on grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. In light of strong current grades and recoveries, we took the opportunity to perform maintenance to improve the long-term reliability of the mill, while maintaining our production target of 250,000 ounces.\nAt our U.S. operations, the first quarter performance was on the plan, with total production of 169,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,312 per ounce. Beginning with Fort Knox, in part due to a significant weather event in Alaska at the beginning of the year, Q1 production of 53,000 ounces was lower quarter-over-quarter, due to lower mill throughput, grade and recoveries, and lower ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. Cost of sales of $1,466 per ounce was higher over the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower production.\nAt Manh Choh, mining activities including ore mining and stockpiling has commenced and transportation of the ore to Fort Knox continues to ramp up. At Fort Knox, mill modifications and site preparation is progressing on plan. First production for Manh Choh is on track for early Q3. At Gold Mountain, production of 47,000 ounces improved over the prior quarter, driven by higher ounces recovered from the past. Cost of sales of $1,103 per ounce was lower quarter-over-quarter on higher production and a higher proportion of capitalized development.\nAt Round Mountain, production of 68,000 ounces was higher quarter-over-quarter on stronger mill grade throughput and recoveries. Cost of sales of $1,329 per ounce improved over the prior quarter on higher production and a higher proportion of capitalized mining activity related to the ongoing stripping at Phase S.\nAlso at Phase S, procurement and construction activities for the heap leach pads expansion remain on track and first production remains on schedule to begin in the second half of next year.\nWith that, I'll now pass the call over to William.\n\nWilliam D. Dunford\n\nSenior Vice-President of Technical Services\n\nThanks, Claude. I'll start by continuing on Round Mountain and then provide a few updates on progress at Curlew and Great Bear. At Round Mountain Phase X, as Paul mentioned, the underground decline has progressed well with over 1,800 meters developed thus far. Decline has now reached the point where we can begin drilling off the target mineralization from underground and we will be doing so in Q2. As we progressed the decline in Q1, we took the opportunity to drill in between the open pit and the underground target.\nAs you can see on the slide, this drilling hit multiple higher grade intercepts, including 9.9 grams per tonne over 21 meters and 16.6 grams per tonne over 8 meters in an area where we had not previously modeled mineralization. We remain excited by the potential for higher margin production from the underground of Phase X and are pleased to see these higher grade drill results supporting that potential. We look forward to updating you with additional drill results from the main target later this year.\nAt Gold Hill we are progressing infill drilling of the underground targets from the bottom of the open pit, and we are also continuing surface exploration, targeting extensions at depth and along strike.\nMoving to Curlew Basin, underground drilling continued at the recently discovered Roadrunner vein zone. Multiple zones of stockwork veins were intersected, while testing strike and dip extents over a broad area. Assays from this drilling are still pending. Team has also been working on optimizing the potential mine designs to improve margins and we are encouraged by the results to-date.\nAs Paul mentioned, we had a very productive first quarter of drilling at Great Bear, completing approximately 38 of the planned 120 kilometers of drilling budgeted for the full year. Our drilling at Great Bear continues to focus on defining zones of inferred mineralization at greater depths at LP Central, Discovery and Viggo.\nIn Q1, we saw further high grade intercepts around 1,000 meters vertical depth at Yuma, building on the resource we already have in that area, including 18.6 grams per tonne over 10 meters. Our drilling also showed good grades and widths at depths well beyond our current resource at Discovery, Yaro, and Oro, as you can see on the slide. These zones continue to grow at depth, similar to what we saw with resource growth through deeper drilling at Yuma.\nAlthough the PEA will be limited to MINI resources, this drilling continues to demonstrate our thesis that this orogenic deposit extends at significant depths with strong continuity, providing the potential for a long life, high grade mining complex. As with many underground, the long-term potential will become more visible as we progress deeper with development to provide efficient drill access to the deeper mineralization, which is why we are now focused on progressing AEX.\nAs a reminder, we are advancing Great Bear across 2 key project streams, the AEX underground decline through which we plan to obtain a bulk sample and perform definition drilling and infill-drilling. And the main project, which includes the mine, mill and related infrastructure required for production. For the AEX decline subject to receipt of permits, we are targeting a start of the surface construction in the second half of the year and start of the underground decline in mid-2025. Detailed engineering, execution planning, and procurement for AEX continue to progress well.\nInfrastructure such as the camp and water treatment plant has now been purchased and we are planning to contract major civil works in Q2. For the main project, we continue to advance technical studies, field work, and comprehensive baseline studies. Work on the PEA is progressing well and we look forward to releasing it in the second half of 2024.\nIn Q1, we also conducted substantial geotechnical work to help inform project studies and to de-risk the project builds. We look forward to continuing to provide updates as we progress all work streams towards advancing AEX in the main project.\nI'll now turn it back to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Will. Our business is off to a strong start this year. There's plenty to look forward to this year and beyond that, we remain excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant cash flow. We have an investment grade balance sheet. We have a competitive dividend. We have an exciting pipeline of exploration and development opportunities. And we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in ESG performance.\nWith that operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kinross Gold Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Lichtenheldt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin your conference.\n\nChris Lichtenheldt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, President and CEO; and from Kinross senior leadership team, Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, Will Dunford, and Jeff old. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results different from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 2 of this presentation, our news release dated February 14, 2024, the MD&A for the period ended December 31, 2023, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, discuss our outlook for the business going forward and review our achievements in the area of ESG. I will then hand the call over to Andrea to discuss our financial performance and guidance, on to review our operating performance and will to discuss our projects, exploration initiatives and resource update. Looking back, we have a strong 2023 and successfully delivered on our targets and are well positioned for another strong year ahead. Our operations are performing well. Our projects are advancing on schedule at all budget. Our exploration program is delivering value. We are generating substantial free cash flow, and our balance sheet is in excellent condition and continues to delever.\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, we had a strong finish to the year, resulting in full year production in the top half of our guidance range and costs at the low end of our guidance range. The strong performance on cost was primarily driven by transparency on inflation that was incorporated into our targets. Our focus on operational performance with strong production contributing to cost results and favorable trends on grade within our portfolio as we ramped up higher grade operations. As always, we will remain focused on cost control in 2024.\nHowever, we are expecting a modest increase, which Andrea will discuss shortly. The strong performance on cost was underpinned by our 3 highest margin assets, Tasiast, La Coipa and Paracatu. Tasiast and Paracatu, are 2 top-tier assets together accounted for approximately 1.2 million ounces. Adding in La Coipa, these 3 assets accounted for just over 2/3 of our production and an ASIC of approximately $1,000 per ounce. At Tasiast, we delivered record throughput and strong production in Q4, driving record full year production. Tasiast was our largest production contributor for the full year. Tasiast was also our highest margin mine and largest free cash flow generator in 2023.\nAt La Coipa, we also saw very strong margins and free cash flow, and we are pleased with how the operation is performing. At Paracatu, we had another year of steady production highlighted by strong mill performance and record recoveries. And while Q4 grades were lower as flat, it was the highest throughput quarter in recent years. In the U.S., we delivered a successful year with both production and costs across the U.S. operations performing well against our targets. At Round Mountain, we approved the Phase S open pit expansion, securing strong production through the decade and bringing clarity to the future at Round Mountain. Also at Round Mountain, we are making good progress on our planned next stages of production, Phase X Underground and the Gold Hill satellite opportunity.\nTurning now to projects. Our mill expansion at Tasiast and restart of La Coipa were completed in 2023 as well as the construction of our solar power plant at Tasiast. In Alaska, construction of the Manh Choh project is essentially complete and is on budget and on schedule for initial high-grade production in the second half of the year. At Great Bear, we continue to make excellent progress. Looking back to the time of the acquisition just 2 years ago, we started with no declared resources.\nToday, we have approximately 2.8 million ounces of high-grade M&I, and an incremental $3.3 million of high-grade inferred ounces. In 2023, we added more than 1 million ounces of growth to the LP underground resource from the initial resource we declared last year, which continues to support our view of a large, long-life, high-grade mining complex. Additionally, we continue to hit new high-grade intercepts. As outlined in yesterday's release, we recently intersected nearly 390 grams per ton across a true width of 3.5 meters at a vertical depth of nearly 1 kilometer. I would note that this hole was not captured in our year-end resource update. Ongoing drilling on the property continues to demonstrate that this is a world-class deposit in a Tier 1 location. In addition to drilling success, other areas of the project are also advancing well, which Will is going to elaborate on later on this call.\nBefore moving to our outlook, I'd like to comment on our year-end reserve and resource update. As expected, our year-end reserves decreased over the prior year primarily due to depletion. As work advances on our new projects, we are upgrading the quality of our resource through the addition of higher-margin ounces. Our measured and indicated resources remained stable at year-end at approximately 26 million ounces, while our inferred resources grew by approximately 1 million ounces driven by the substantial increase at Great Bear. Moving to our outlook. We are reaffirming our stable production profile. 2024 is expected to resemble last year with production and CapEx at similar levels. However, costs are expected to increase modestly as a result of inflation, production mix and mine sequencing.\nOur production outlook for 2025 of 2 million ounces remains consistent with previous guidance, and we are introducing another year of production guidance at 2 million ounces in 2026. Looking further ahead, we continue to expect production to remain around the 2-million-ounce level through the end of the decade. Maintaining production at this level will require the approval of some of our pipeline projects, including underground opportunities at Round Mountain and Carlo and open pit mine life extensions at La Coipa. We will continue to advance these initiatives, and we'll update you on our progress as we move forward.\nWith respect to capital allocation, we remain focused on debt repayment. We reduced our debt level in 2023 and our balance sheet is in excellent shape. We believe the continuation of debt reduction remains an optimal use of excess cash. We will also continue paying our competitive dividend of $0.03 per share quarterly. Before turning over to Andrea, I'd like to comment on some of our achievements in ESG. In 2023, we once again demonstrated a strong commitment to ESG by operating responsibly and advancing our strategy across this important area. Our 2023 sustainability and ESG report, which we will publish in May, will provide a detailed review on our ESG performance and initiatives throughout the year.\nSome highlights from this past year include the construction of the solar power plant at Tasiast, which helps move us closer to our goal of reducing emissions intensity by 30% by 2030. In the area of social, we made approximately $10 million of monetary and in-kind contributions through site investments, including to the University of Atacama Research Station near our La Coipa mine in Chile and establishing the Kinross Alaska future leader scholarship at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The goal of this scholarship is to advance the inclusion of underrepresented people within the resource industry. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. This morning, I'll review financial highlights from the quarter and full year, provide an overview of our balance sheet and discuss our guidance and outlook. As Paul noted, we finished the year with production of just over 2.1 million ounces, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. In the fourth quarter, we produced 547,000 ounces. Q4 sales of 565,000 ounces were slightly above production due to timing. Our Q4 cost of sales of $976 per ounce and ASIC of $1,353 per ounce were higher compared to the prior quarter as expected, primarily due to lower production at Paracatu.\nFull year cost of sales of $942 per ounce was below the $970 guidance midpoint, driven by strong cost performance across the portfolio. Concept Paracatu were on plan in 2023 and are expected to increase in 2024 due to lower planned production. Margins were strong at $998 per ounce sold in Q4 and $1,003 per ounce sold for the full year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.11 in Q4 and $0.44 for the full year. Adjusted operating cash flow was $407 million in Q4 and approximately $1.7 billion for the full year.\nAttributable CapEx was $298 million in Q4 and $1.05 billion for the full year. Attributable free cash flow in Q4 was $117 million and for the full year was $560 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year having further strengthened our financial position. After repaying $190 million of debt in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $350 million in cash and approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity. Our net debt improved to $1.9 billion at year-end from $2 billion at Q3. We repaid the $50 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility in October and then the $140 million balance on our Tasiast loan in December.\nThe Tasiast loan was repaid early with cash generated from the Tasiast operation, resulting in interest savings of approximately $35 million, assuming current rates over the original term to 2027. Our trailing 12-month net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued to trend lower as we finished the year just above 1x. In 2023 as a whole, we reduced our total debt by approximately $360 million. As Paul mentioned, we aim to further delever our balance sheet in 2024 as we plan to allocate excess free cash generated this year against the 2025 term loan. The term loan will be reclassified to current in our Q1 financials given its maturity in March 2025.\nTurning to our guidance and outlook. As Paul indicated, 2024 is expected to look similar to 2023 as our portfolio continues to generate strong and stable returns. We are forecasting production in the range of 2.1 million ounces remaining consistent year-over-year. For costs, we're guiding $1,020 per ounce for cost of sales and $1,360 per ounce for all-in sustaining costs. Expected cost of sales of $1,020 per ounce is up approximately 5% compared with our $970 per ounce guidance from 2023. The expected increase is driven by 3 factors: modest inflation, which has subsided compared with recent years, but has not gone away. Sales mix was slightly more of our production coming from our U.S. operations, which operate with higher costs and a temporarily lower production and, therefore, higher cost year prepared to choose mine plan.\nAttributable capital expenditures guidance of $1.05 billion for 2024 is in line with 2023. Approximately $550 million of this CapEx is expected to be nonsustaining in 2024. Production is expected to be higher in the second half of the year as Manh Choh comes online. Cash flow is also expected to be stronger in the second half as a result of the protection profile as well as our typical timing of payments related to taxes in the first half of the year.\nOur 2025 production guidance of 2 million ounces remains unchanged from our guidance update last year. Looking ahead to 2026, as Paul noted, we've introduced another year of production guidance of 2 million ounces, in line with 2025 and in line with our expectation for production of approximately 2 million ounces through the decade. Based on currently approved projects, attributable CapEx is expected to be $850 million in 2025 and $650 million in 2026. However, as we continue to approve additional projects to sustain our production level, we expect CapEx will ultimately remain stable around $1 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nClaude J. S. Schimper\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrea. Last quarter, I began by sharing the details of our homegrown Safety Excellence program. We will take a genuine bottom approach to fostering our safety culture. The program has now been delivered to over 6,000 employees and business partners worldwide with 44 different nationalities participating. We are proud of this program, and we'll be relentless in keeping safety as our core piece of our operating floss. Moving on to our operations. As Paul highlighted, we delivered a strong end to the year, achieving our full year targets on both production and costs. I'm pleased to say this is a testament to the strong focus and dedication to operational excellence that our team demonstrated over the course of the year. Our 2 cornerstone operations, Tasiast and Paracatu had another year of significant production. These 2 assets provided over half of our ounces and drove meaningful cash flow for our business. In 2023, we continue to advance our projects at Tasiast and La Coipa, which was successfully completed prior to the new year.\nAt Tasiast, we achieved record full year production of 621,000 ounces, benefiting from strong throughput and grades. In the fourth quarter, the mill demonstrated higher throughput over the prior quarter, reaching a quarterly average rate of approximately 22,000 tons per day, driving a strong final quarter of production of 161,000 ounces. Cost of sales of $645 per ounce in the fourth quarter was the lowest in the portfolio. And this was our lowest cost producer in 2023 with a cost of sales of $661 per ounce. We are anticipating another strong year from Tasiast with production guided to be around 610,000 ounces as higher throughput is offset by lower plant grade. Margins are anticipated to be robust again this year with cost of sales expected to be $670 per ounce.\nAt the Tasiast power plant, construction is now complete, with the first power being delivered in December. We will be ramping up part 2 with the first half of the year. Paracatu had another year of substantial output with full year production of 588,000 ounces. Production in Q4 was lower than in Q3 as previously indicated, due to mine sequency resulting in lower growth. The strong performance in Paracatu continues to be a standout with excellent throughput and recovery performance in Q4. Production in 2024 is expected to be lower across higher as the mine sequencing continues to transition through lower grade portions of the pit before moving back into higher grades next year.\nAt La Coipa, strong operating performance continued in Q4 with record quarterly production of 74,000 ounces, which was driven by higher throughput and strong grades. The full year production of 260,000 ounces exceeded the top end of guidance, while costs of $681 per ounce came in below the low end of guidance, driving strong free cash flow. La Coipa is expected to have another strong year with a target of 250,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $800 per ounce. Moving to the U.S. assets. We had a strong final quarter with production of 184,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $1,304 per ounce, both improving over the prior output. Full year production of 684,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,318 per ounce was achieved. Production across the U.S. assets is expected to increase this year to 750,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $1,330 per ounce.\nThe increase in production is due to the expected contribution from Manh Choh in the second half of the year and higher production from Bald Mountain on higher planned ore stacking rates and higher grades. For Knox, Q4 production of 84,000 ounces increased over the prior quarter, mainly due to higher mill throughput. At Manh Choh, construction is essentially complete, and the mining activities, including ore mining and stockpiling have commenced. Construction of the mine modifications at Fort Knox also continues to progress. Construction of the conveyors and associated buildings, along with the interior piping and mechanical installations will continue throughout the first quarter. Decommissioning and operational readiness team is preparing for pre-commissioning activities.\nAt Bald Mountain, Q4 production of approximately 44,000 ounces to improve over the prior quarter on higher grades, helping drive lower cost of sales. In 2024, Bald Mountain is expected to have a stronger year with grades increasing in the back half of the year on mine planning. At Round Mountain, production of approximately 56,000 ounces was lower over the prior quarter due to fewer ounces coming from the leach pads, while costs decreased due to the lower input costs and timing of inventory movement. As Paul mentioned, our work at Round Mountain is advancing on plan. Stripping on Phase S has commenced, and the operations team is in place.\nDetailed engineering of the pad expansion has been completed and construction activities are on track. Production from Phase S remains on schedule to begin in the second half of 2025. Round Mountain is expected to produce at a level similar to 2023 with production coming from ongoing mining at Phase W2. With our projects complete and the operational momentum we are seeing across all our mines, we are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2024. With that, I will now pass the call over to William.\n\nWilliam D. Dunford\n\nSenior Vice-President of Technical Services\n\nThanks, Claude. I'll start by expanding on Round Mountain, provide updates on Carlo, Great Bear and our exploration initiatives before ending with a few comments on our year-end resource update. At Round Mountain, in addition to our ongoing work on the open pit phases that Claude discussed, we continue to focus on exploring and studying our higher grade, potentially higher-margin underground opportunities of Phase X and Gold Hill. We are progressing well with the exploration decline of Phase X, having developed 1,475 meters to date, which is over half of the planned development to the initial exploration decline.\nThis has put us in closer proximity to the target mineralization for Phase X, allowing us to commence exploration drilling along the periphery of the target earlier this year. This drilling has already hit a high-grade narrow vein with course visible gold, something we have seen throughout our history at Round Mountain, which has ultimately led to positive reconciliation, and we are pleased to see this trend continuing at depth. We will continue development of the exploration decline in parallel with the exploration and definition drilling and we'll be in a position to start definition drilling of the primary Phase X targets by Q2.\nAt Gold Hill, infield drilling from the bottom of the open pit and exploration drilling from surface continue to advance as planned. Stepping back, we remain excited about the underground opportunities at Round Mountain. We see the potential for Phase X to come online in late 2026 or early 2027 and Gold Hill to come online towards the end of the decade, extending production at Round Mountain into the next decade. Moving to Carlo Basin. Our results continue to trend well and support further work on the assets.\nThrough 2023 exploration, we increased the size of the inferred resource by 34% as we confirmed extensions and continuity within several key zones of mineralization. We have now delineated approximately 400,000 ounces of measured and indicated, and 700,000 ounces of inferred resources with strong grades of around 6 grams per ton. You will recall that last quarter, we released results of full 11.68 with 14 meters at 16.5 grams per ton down debt at the Road Runner zone, which was both wider and higher grade than our existing resource.\nAs you can see on the slide, at the end of the year, we received assay results from a few more standout intercepts, showing higher grade and wider potential in the stealth some, including ST-1312, which showed 27 meters at over 12 grams per ton. These higher-grade results are not included in this current resource update. Our focus this year will be to follow up on this higher-grade wider mineralization encountered both at Roadrunner and Stealth and to continue advancing exploration efforts to expand the higher margin, wider, more continuous sales within our existing resource. We continue to study Carlo to optimize the potential value and determine the best path forward for this asset.\nMoving on to Great Bear. As Paul indicated, our 2023 drilling program exceeded our expectations, delivering a significant resource addition of more than 1 million ounces. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher grade underground additions to the inferred resource at depth enabled by the success of directional drilling. This resulted in a 45% increase in the inferred resource and a 28% increase in the inferred grade.\nThe significant inferred rate increase was driven by the new underground resource, having come in at a higher average grade of 6 grams per ton, driving the overall inferred resource grade to 4.5 grams per ton. The total project resource now stands at approximately 2.8 million ounces of measured and indicated, and 3.3 million ounces of inferred resources. As a reminder, the scope of 2023's drilling program was primarily to add underground resources at depth and the main LP Zone. To execute on this plan, we introduced directional drilling, which was very effective, allowing us to meaningfully increase the underground resource at LP. As you can see on the slide, our primary resource additions came from new higher-grade underground resources between 500- and 1,000-meter levels, showing a significant extension to the LP Zone. These extensions clearly continue to demonstrate our thesis of this orogenic deposits continuing with strong rates of tax.\nYou can also see on the slide that we continue to intercept high-grade mineralization beyond our current resource additions at that. A particular note is full VR843, shown with a star just to the left of center, which intersected 389 grams per ton over a minable web of 3.5 meters. Given the timing of this drilling, this intercept didn't make it into this resource update. But this whole, along with all the other assays we see, continues to support our view that this will be a high-quality long-life underground mine following the initial open pit. While the LP Zone represents the bulk of our resource expansion, we also saw some growth at Hinge and Limb, more classic Red Lake style deposits.\nAnd as noted last quarter, we saw multiple high-grade intercepts at Hinge from the directional drilling well below the current resource, again, showing potential for future extensions at depth. Hinge and Limb continue to show potential to supplement production from the LP Zone in the future and demonstrate the significant optionality of our land package. Looking to this year's exploration program, our strategy will be similar to last year's, with our primary focus on further expanding the mineralized zones at LP, including both the Central LP area and extensions of Discovery in Vigo. We will also continue to look for additional deposits along strike and for expansions of our Red Lake style mineralization at Hinge and Limb.\nThe 2024 program will be comprised of approximately 120 kilometers of drilling. Our program will continue to target expansions of the underground resource. However, it's worth noting that as planned drilling will be deeper, progress on resource additions is expected to be more modest than realized in 2023. Moving to other areas at Great Bear. As a reminder, we are advancing across 2 key streams; the AEX underground decline through which we plan to obtain all sample and perform definition and infill drilling in the LP Zone and the main project, which includes the mine mail and related infrastructure required for production.\nFor the AEX decline, the mining lease for the main AEX surface footprint has been received, providing us with the necessary surface and mining rights to develop AEX, subject to obtaining the required provincial permits. Feasibility-level design and engineering is now complete. The service design for AEX is shown here on the slide and detailed engineering for the AEX infrastructure is well underway. Provincial permitting of the AEX remains on track. Procurement for long-lead items such as the camp, power infrastructure and water treatment is underway, and we are targeting a potential start of the surface construction for AEX in the second half of the year, subject to receipt of permits and potential start of the underground decline in mid-2025. For the main project, we continue to advance technical studies, including engineering and field test work campaigns. The results of this work will be outlined in our PEA plan for the second half of the year.\nThe initial project description has been submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, formally commencing the federal assessment process. The detailed project description is expected to be formally submitted shortly. The comprehensive baseline study program encompassing air and noise, hydrogeology, geochemistry, archeology, water quality and several other categories continues to advance. These studies underpin our indigenous consultation and permitting efforts. Our exploration team was very active in 2023. In addition to the drilling success at Great Bear, we also saw strong developments from within our portfolio of Brownfield and Greenfield prospects.\nOur Brownfields program, which accounts for approximately 90% of our exploration budget, consisted of more than 200 kilometers of drilling last year, taking place primarily within the footprint of existing mines and projects where we are targeting higher grade, potentially higher margin deposits and possible extensions within our current debts-. As detailed in our press release, this program demonstrated notable results across several locations. Having already discussed Round Mountain, I'll start with our other U.S. assets.\nAt Fort Knox, program focused primarily on 2 main areas; Oxide growth around the Fort Knox Oxide and on deeper underground targets within the Dandelions zone. At Manh Choh, near mine exploration work took place at 6 targets, and the exploration program was expanded to include several new targets identified near the mine road corridor. At Bald Mountain, drilling focused on near-term resource growth, which resulted in an addition to the reserve.\nMoving to Tasiast RC drilling testing for extensions of the North satellite area, successfully intersected mineralization and prove the continuity of a Nola structure along with primary Greenstone Belt. Drilling this year will look to further explore on trend of the mineralization. In addition, deep drilling plan for this year will begin targeting extensions at West Branch, amend and prolongation with the aim of supporting an underground mining scenario at Tasiast.\nMoving to Chile. Our Brownfield drilling program uncovered potential porphyry mineralization, approximately 8 kilometers due north of our mine facilities. At La Coipa, we completed approximately 15 kilometers of drilling to test the extent of near surface oxide mineralization proximal to current and historic cuts. In Brazil, recent drilling of soil anomalies, primarily to the Northwest of Paracatu have revealed similar style mineralization and grades in the same post packages. Further drilling at several untested soil targets will take place this year.\nMoving to our Greenfield program. Approximately 52 kilometers of drilling was completed across Manitoba, Nevada and our JV project in Northern Finland. Our large snow Lake land package in Manitoba continued to show exciting potential for high-grade gold mineralization associated with share-hosted courts panic. In Nevada, RC drilling was completed across several prospective properties with the potential for low sulfidation epithermal and Carlin style gold mineralization. In Finland, we continue to advance exploration on the Lane East property alongside our joint venture partner.\nMoving to our broader reserve and resource update. As Paul mentioned, our reserves declined this year as we are in a phase of resource growth focused on adding higher-grade ounces at earlier stage projects such as Great Bear, Carlo and the Round Mountain undergrounds. Our measured and indicated resources remained stable at approximately 26 million ounces and inferred resources were up more than 1 million ounces, driven by the previously discussed high-grade additions at Great Bear and Furloughs. We are excited by the significantly higher grade of these inferred resources, increasing the quality of our overall resource base and providing potential for future high-margin production. I will now turn it back to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Will. After delivering on our commitments in 2023, we intend to carry this momentum into 2024. Our business is well positioned to deliver another strong year, both operationally and financially. And looking forward, we remain excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant cash flow. We have an investment-grade balance sheet. We have a competitive dividend. We have an exciting pipeline of exploration and development opportunities across several attractive jurisdictions. And we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in ESG performance within the industry. With that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

I would now like to welcome Chris Lichtenheldt, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin the call. Chris, over to you.\n\nChris Lichtenheldt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, President and CEO; and from the Kinross senior leadership team, Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, Will Dunford and Geoff Gold.\nFor a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 2 of this presentation, our news release dated November 8, 2023, the MD&A for the period ended September 30, 2023, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will provide an overview of our third quarter and update you on our ESG initiatives. I will then hand the call over to Andrea to discuss financial performance, Claude to highlight our operating performance, and Will to discuss our projects.\nOur operations continued to deliver strong performance in the third quarter, and we remain well positioned to meet our full year guidance. Our focus on delivering on our targets continues to drive strong results. By the end of Q3, we had produced just over 3/4 of our full year production at costs that are tracking in the lower half of our guidance range. The business is performing well, and we generated strong cash flow. In the first 9 months, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, and after reinvesting in our operations and project pipeline, we generated over $400 million of free cash flow.\nWith respect to our operations, in the third quarter, Tasiast, Paracatu and La Coipa all continued to deliver excellent results, accounting for approximately 70% of our production with an AISC of just over $1,000 per ounce. Tasiast had a record production quarter, producing 171,000 ounces, was once again our highest cash flow operation. Paracatu also performed well in the third quarter, and as planned, had its highest production quarter of the year. La Coipa was once again our lowest cost operation and also generated strong cash flow.\nSwitching to the U.S. Our operations performed well with production at each site higher than the prior quarter. Fort Knox had a strong production quarter, while also making no modifications to accommodate the higher-grade Manh Choh ore. We recently celebrated the commencement of mining activity in a groundbreaking ceremony at the local native village of Tetlin and the governor of Alaska. Manh Choh remains on budget, on schedule, can begin contributing ore to Fort Knox in the second half of next year.\nAt Round Mountain, work has progressed on several fronts. As outlined in our release, we are pleased to report that we have now approved Phase S, making the future at Round Mountain more clear. Our plan is to progress from the current Phase W to Phase S, which is the next phase of open pit mining. These two phases will take production at Round until the end of the decade. In addition to Phase S, we also see potential to add higher-grade underground ore first from Phase X and later from Gold Hill. You'll hear more on this later from Will.\nAt Great Bear, we continued to make strong progress in the third quarter. Resource definition drilling is ongoing with 11 rigs currently operating on site. We are seeing excellent results from our directional drilling program, which is allowing us to increase our underground resources more cost effectively. As I noted last quarter, we are expecting a meaningful increase to the LP underground resource as part of our year end update.\nAdditionally, directional drilling in other areas of mineralization are also showing promising signs of growth. In particular, at the Hinge zone, located adjacent to the main LP zone, a recent high-grade intercept returned 2.8 meters true width with grades of approximately 260 grams per tonne at a vertical depth of 870 meters.\nAt the Great Bear project, we have both a provincial and federal permitting process. In the third quarter, we continued to progress studies and provincial permitting for the advanced exploration decline, which is what we refer to as the AEX. With respect to the main project, we progressed permitting with IAAC, Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, on federal matters. We are continuing our work on environmental baseline studies applicable to the main project as well as indigenous consultations. We also continued to advance technical studies, including engineering and field test work. We plan to provide an update on this work in the form of a preliminary economic assessment, or PEA, in the second half of next year.\nI'd like now to switch gears and highlight some of our latest work at ESG. In the third quarter, we advanced our ESG efforts across 3 main areas. Number one, we completed a comprehensive review of our community management system, leading to the development of a new social performance management system for implementation at all of our operations. And two, we advanced our natural capital strategy focused on land use, water management, biodiversity, air quality, waste management and reclamation. And three, we continue to deliver on our climate strategy. Construction of our 34-megawatt solar facility at Tasiast is nearly complete. For context, 34 megawatts of clean energy will reduce our carbon emissions by over 0.5 million tonnes over the current life of mine. This project is one of the key contributors to achieve our 2030 emissions reduction goal.\nSo to recap, with strong year-to-date performance, we are well positioned to meet our guidance. With our projects at Tasiast and La Coipa complete, we look forward to these assets continuing to generate strong cash flows. Our financial position is strengthened as we have continued to repay debt. We continue to return capital through a competitive dividend, and we are advancing the next round of projects that will contribute to our future.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. I'll discuss financial highlights from the quarter, provide an overview of our balance sheet and comment on our guidance and outlook.\nAs Paul noted, our strong performance continued in the quarter with production on track for 2.1 million ounces and costs tracking in the lower half of our guidance range. In Q3, we produced 585,000 ounces, anchored by strong production from our 2 top tier assets, Tasiast and Paracatu, continued solid performance at La Coipa and increased production over the prior quarter at each of our U.S. sites.\nGold sales of 571,000 ounces were slightly above production due to timing of sales. In Q3, our average realized gold price was $1,929 per ounce, in line with the average spot gold price. Cost of sales of $911 per ounce in Q3 was relatively stable with the prior quarter. Also sales at Tasiast, Paracatu and La Coipa advanced $735 per ounce, once again underpinning strong performance and free cash flow.\nMargins were strong in Q3 at $1,018 per ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs were $1,296 per ounce in Q3, which was in line with the prior quarter.\nYear-to-date cost of sales of $931 per ounce were below the midpoint of our full year cost guidance range. Costs are expected to increase in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower expected grades at Paracatu as a result of planned mine sequencing. For 2023 as a whole, we now expect to finish the year in the lower half of our guidance range, so below $970 per ounce.\nIn Q3, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.12 and adjusted operating cash flow per share was $0.38. Attributable CapEx in the third quarter was $272 million. We remain on track for our full year guidance, but we do expect to finish the year towards the top end of our range.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $123 million, or $187 million excluding working capital changes, and over $400 million for the 9-month period.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong in the third quarter as we continue to delever. We ended the quarter with $465 million in cash and approximately $2 billion of total liquidity. Our net debt declined during the quarter as we repaid $50 million of the $100 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid the remaining $50 million balance. Our 12-month net debt to EBITDA ratio continued to trend lower as we finished the quarter at 1.1x.\nAs mentioned, following the 9-month results and a good start to Q4, we're in a strong position to achieve our guidance. I'll now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nClaude J. S. Schimper\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrea. I would first like to begin by discussing the significant progress our team has made on our journey to a more progressive, people-centric health and safety philosophy in the last year.\nAll our employees and business partners play a major role in shaping how we operate safely across our operations. Our homegrown safety excellence program stands out for its genuine bottom-up approach, leveraging the collective experience of employees to foster a culture of ownership, collaboration and shared purpose. This has begun to influence how we operate, and safety excellence is an integral piece of our operational excellence approach.\nNow moving on to Q3 and our operations. As Paul said, we are well on track to meet our annual guidance. Our expansion projects at Tasiast and La Coipa are complete, and all our mines are performing as planned. Tasiast delivered record quarterly production of 171,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $666 per ounce, benefitting from strong throughput and strong grades and recoveries as we continued mining in the higher-grade section of West Branch 4. We remain on track to achieve our full year production guidance in the range of 610,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $680 per ounce.\nConstruction at the solar power plant is nearly complete, and we are on plan for first part of the grid by year end. Installation of the photovoltaic panels, inverters and transformer stations are now complete, and the battery system installation is well-progressed. Electrical works and the completion of the grid connection are continuing with recommissioning testing underway.\nParacatu had a strong quarter, producing 172,00 ounces at a cost of sales of $845 per ounce. As indicated, fourth quarter production at Paracatu is expected to be lower and costs slightly higher due to the location of mining in the pit. We remain on track to achieve our full year production guidance in the range of 580,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $890 per ounce.\nAt La Coipa, strong operating performance continued during Q3, driven by strong grades and recoveries. La Coipa was the lowest cost mine in our portfolio in Q3, producing 66,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $629 per ounce and contributing strong free cash flow. We remain on track to meet our full year production guidance in the range of 240,00 ounces, and costs are tracking below our guidance.\nNow moving to the U.S. operations. Production improved over the prior quarter at each of our sites while costs remained in line. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance range of 670,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,370 per ounce.\nBeginning with the Fort Knox operations, Q3 production of approximately 72,000 ounces was slightly higher quarter-over-quarter. At Manh Choh, activities remain on schedule and on budget, and we are on track for initial production in the second half of next year. Construction is now 90% complete, with commissioning activities well underway as well as the preparation to transition the project to operations.\nConstruction on the mill modifications at Fort Knox to process Manh Choh ore is progressing on plan with all the concrete works now completed and work is now progressing primarily inside the mill on tanks and piping components. Further work is scheduled to take place over the next several months per plan, ahead of production in the second half of next year.\nAt Bald Mountain, production of approximately 41,000 ounces improved over the prior quarter as the result of higher heap leach stacking rates as all mining activity ramped up considerably against the second quarter.\nAt Round Mountain, production of approximately 64,000 ounces was higher over the prior quarter with the milling of high-grade ore from Phase W 2. Costs at Round Mountain were better than initially planned due to favorable grades, stacking rates and the timing of the leach inventory.\nWith that, I will now pass the floor over to Will.\n\nWilliam Dunford\n\nThanks, Claude. I'll start by discussing Round Mountain and then provide updates at Curlew and Great Bear.\nAs Paul mentioned, we have approved moving forward with mining at Phase S, securing meaningful production scale at Round Mountain through the end of the decade. As you will recall, we made the decision at the end of last year to defer the mining of Phase S, given our focus on ensuring strong economic margins and returns on our capital investments. Since that time, we have been working on optimizing the design and are pleased with the outcome of that work, which has yielded a lower-strip, higher grade and significantly lower CapEx plan. This was achieved by stepping in the pit design, removing higher-strip, lower-margin ounces and by identifying opportunities to add some near-surface, lower-strip ounces earlier in the mine sequence to offset our stripping costs. This optimized design has yielded a high-return, resilient opportunity with a significantly lower CapEx that can now be funded by production at Round Mountain over the next 2 years and provide a bridge to our future underground opportunities.\nTo provide clarity around our mine plan sequence at Round Mountain, we are mining W2 now, and we'll see similar production next year before W2 starts to taper off and Phase S starts to ramp up in 2025. By 2026, we will be at full production of Phase S, and we'll continue to produce through the end of the decade. We anticipate adding approximately 750,000 ounces of total production from Phase S. The combination of W2 and Phase S are expected to average production of 215,000 ounces annually over the 2024 to 2028 time frame.\nAs we continue to mine these open pit phases, we are focused on exploring and studying our higher-grade, potentially higher-margin underground opportunities at Phase X and Gold Hill. We see potential for Phase X to come online in late 2026 or early 2027 and Gold Hill to come online towards the end of the decade. The exploration decline at Phase X is progressing well with approximately 1,000 meters developed to date, keeping us well on track to start definition drilling early next year. At Gold Hill, we will continue drilling in Q4 of this year and into next year.\nMoving to Curlew in Washington State. In Q3, we intersected a new vein zone as we continue to follow the interpreted paleosurface to depth. You can see this intersection on the slide, full 1168, which returned 14 meters at 16.5 grams per tonne. While it is only one hole, this intercept is both wider and higher grade than our existing resource, which we can see on the slide, higher up to the left. The existing resource averages just over 6 grams per tonne and is generally narrow vein, offering potential to add production to our portfolio later in the decade. Exploration next year will focus on the wider and more continuous areas in our existing resource and will follow up on the new zone of higher-grade mineralization that we recently intercepted.\nMoving on to Great Bear. In Q3, we moved 1 of our 6 directional rigs across our LP to the Hinge zone which, as Paul indicated, results in the highest-grade intercept we have seen since acquiring the property, showing approximately 260 grams per tonne at a minable width of 2.8 meters. The Hinge zone, which is classic Red Lake style mineralization, is approximately 700 meters away from the LP zone, and we expect to be able to easily access it from our exploration decline, which will be located midway between the two. This high-grade intercept at approximately 870 meters vertical depth is about 600 meters below our inferred resource. Along with other drill results, this confirms our view that the Hinge zone can provide additional high-grade ore to supplement the LP zone.\nIn addition to the high-grade intercept at Hinge, you can see on the slide our latest intercepts at the LP zone where the other drill rigs have been primarily focused. The directional drilling has increased the density of our intercepts at depth, allowing us to target a meaningful addition to the underground resource. We continue to see wide, high-grade mineralization, reinforcing our thesis that this system continues at depth and provides potential for a high productivity, long life of mine. We will be updating our resource estimate on the back of this drilling and our year-end update in February.\nIn addition to the drilling campaign, we are advancing in two key areas at Great Bear. The AEX decline, through which we will be able to complete definition drilling at depth and bulk sampling, and the main project, which includes the mine, mill and related infrastructure required for production. For the AEX decline, feasibility level design and engineering is now complete. You can see the surface design for AEX here on this slide. Provincial permitting is on track and procurement for long lead items such as the camp, our infrastructure and water treatment is underway. Surface construction is planned for the second half of next year.\nFor the main project, design and engineering is well underway. Baseline studies and field work campaigns are also progressing well. Notably, we have progressed an extensive test work program of soil and overburdened geotechnical conditions to provide increased certainty as we progress the design of our project infrastructure. The recent bedrock geotechnical drilling has also continued to demonstrate composite ground and favorable rock characteristics for both the open pit and underground.\nPermitting work at the main project is ongoing. We expect to release a PEA in the second half of next year.\nIn summary, we are excited by the continued success of our drilling campaign and by the progress we are making to bring this cornerstone project into production. I'll now turn it back to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Will. In closing, we have delivered a strong third quarter and first 9 months, and we are well on track to meet our annual guidance. Looking forward, we are excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant cash flow. We have an investment-grade balance sheet. We have an attractive dividend. We have an exciting pipeline of opportunities. And we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that has made us a leader in ESG performance within the industry.\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\n\nJohn P. Renwick\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Planning, Kellogg Co.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2023. I'm joined this morning by Steven Cahillane, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.\nSlide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com.\nAs always, when referring to our results and outlook today, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Kellogg Co.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter featuring 2 key elements depicted on Slide #5. Not only did we sustain top line growth that remain better than our long-term targets but we did so across our portfolio and geographies with growth in all major category groups in each of our 4 regions. And we did so even as we lapped the prior year's retail inventory replenishment and particularly strong in market performance. We also continue to experience a sooner-than-expected recovery in our gross profit margin. Much of this is related to bottlenecks and shortages diminishing.\nThis recovery is ahead of schedule, and it was a principal driver behind our better-than-expected profit and earnings this quarter. Also encouraging is the momentum we've continued to see in our biggest, most differentiated brands shown on Slide #6. These advantaged brands made up half of our net sales in 2022. And and they continue to outpace our overall growth, creating both top line momentum and a favorable margin mix. So when we put it all together, the earlier-than-expected margin recovery and the sustained top line growth across our portfolio, you can see why we feel comfortable raising our full year sales, profit and earnings guidance again.\nWe also remain very active on our social and environmental program, Kellogg's Better Days promise. Slide #7 shows just a few examples of actions we took during the quarter, including donations and volunteering in the area of hunger and tie-ins to important commercial programs with customers. This slide also shows another wave of recognitions that we have received, simply confirming what we already know that doing what is right is in our DNA. In the center of the slide, you can see that we have published an update regarding our progress toward our better days targets.\nOn social goals like addressing hunger or environmental goals like reducing our admissions or in diversity goals, like gender representation and management, we remain ahead of pace on our better days goals. And of course, we remain very busy in getting ready for our pending separation. Indeed, on Slide #8, most of what you see under the Q1, Q2 and the Q2, Q3 phases are now complete. The team has done an exceptional job of digging into every detail, every brand, every process, every role to make sure we have left no stone unturned in our quest to create 2 successful value-creating companies. And as you look to the Q3 phase, you can see a few milestones that are very much upon us.\nOn July 24, W.K. Kellogg Co's Form 10 was filed publicly, providing you with important information about management, strategy, capital structure and carve-out financials. On July 30, just this past Sunday, we began to run W.K. Kellogg and Kellanova in parallel. By running the water through the pipes, so to speak, we can identify and address any process gaps and other opportunities well before the separation takes place. Employees and new roles can transition properly. Services under the transition services agreement can be ironed out more completely. And while this requires incremental expenses, they are already incorporated into our guidance.\nAnd then less than a week from today, on August 9, we will host our day at K investor event at which leaders of both W.K. Kellogg and Kellanova will present to the strategies, the capital structures and the financial outlooks for both companies. Now we still expect the separation transaction to take place during the fourth quarter. Because we can't know the exact timing of the various customary approvals, we can't be more specific than that quite yet, but we have every confidence that it is on track.\nIn sum, the second quarter was another very good quarter in terms of financial results, sustainability actions and progress toward our spin-off. And now let me turn it over to Amit to take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\n\nAmit Banati\n\nVice Chairman, Senior VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide #10 provides a summary of our second quarter and first half results. Net sales growth in quarter 2 was 7% on an organic basis. Importantly, this growth remained broad-based across category groups and regions and paces us a little ahead of our previous full year outlook. Operating profit grew 14% on an adjusted basis. This growth came on top of last year's 10% currency-neutral growth, and it featured the sooner-than-expected recovery in gross profit margin that Steve discussed. This operating profit performance puts us a little ahead of our previous full year outlook.\nEarnings per share grew 5% on an adjusted basis. sustaining mid-single-digit growth in spite of macro-related headwinds versus last year on below-the-line items such as interest expense and pension income. Cash flow through the first half is down year-on-year because of outlays related to the pending spin-off but on track for the full year.\nLet's now discuss each of these in more detail. Slide #11 splits our year-on-year net sales growth into its components. Price/mix growth was sustained in the mid-teens with growth in both developed markets and emerging markets. As expected, price elasticities continued to move higher around the world, and this weighed down our volume. Also contributing to our volume decline was lapping last year's replenishment of trade inventories, particularly as we recovered from the cereal strike.\nForeign currency translation continued to negatively impact net sales growth by nearly 3% year-on-year in the quarter. If today's exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar were to hold, we would expect to see a similar impact in the second half as the favorable impact of lapping last year's dollar strengthening is offset by the recent devaluation of the Nigerian naira. So our top line growth in quarter 2 supports our long-standing planning assumptions for elasticities to rise and for revenue growth management actions to begin to anniversary.\nNext, let's discuss gross profit shown on Slide #12. As we've discussed numerous times, our objective in this high inflation environment has been to protect gross profit dollars via productivity savings and revenue growth management. In quarter 2, our adjusted gross profit increased by 9% year-on-year on top of a year ago quarter that itself was up more than 6% on a currency-neutral basis. From a margin perspective, Recall that our expectation was for a gradual improvement as the year progresses. But as Steve mentioned, we are ahead of pace in this recovery with year-on-year expansion coming sooner than expected. Much of this is driven by bottlenecks and shortages receding, which eliminates many of the inefficiencies and incremental costs experienced over the past year or more.\nIn addition, productivity and revenue growth management continue to catch up to a high market-driven input cost inflation. So while we have a ways to go before we get back to pre-pandemic levels, this performance gives us increased confidence in our ability to recover margins. For 2023, there is no change to our outlook for expansion in the second half, but Q2's better-than-expected performance moves up our full year outlook for gross margin to be somewhere around 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year.\nOperating profit, as shown on Slide #13, grew 14% year-on-year in quarter 2, even as it laps a robust 10% gain in the year earlier quarter and even with advertising and promotion investment increasing year-on-year. Through the first half, our operating profit was up 16% year-on-year. Our second half comparisons get a little tougher, and we have begun to run W.K. Kellogg Company in parallel requiring incremental expenses year-on-year that are already baked into our guidance. Net, we are ahead of pace, and this gives us the confidence to raise our full year operating profit guidance.\nMoving down the income statement, Slide #14 shows that our earnings per share growth has been attributable to operating profit, which has grown enough to more than offset what are severe macro-related headwinds within our below-the-line items. These below-the-line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year due to higher interest rates. In the second half, we expect to see modestly lower interest expense than we recorded in the first half owing to the timing of cash flow.\nOther income decreased sharply year-on-year in each of the first 2 quarters this year. reflecting the accounting of pension and postretirement plan asset values and interest rates stemming from last year's declines in financial markets. Going to favorability in some other items in this line, Q2 came in higher than both Q1 and the run rate we would expect for the remaining quarters.\nOur effective tax rate in quarter 2 was back to the kind of 22% rate we would expect for the full year after being a bit above that in quarter 1. Average shares outstanding were up slightly year-on-year in both quarter 1 and quarter 2 and we would expect that to be the case for the full year as well.\nForeign currency translation turned slightly positive to EPS in quarter 2, finishing the half with about a negative 1% impact. We leave foreign currency translation out of our guidance because it is out of our control and difficult to predict. But if we took today's exchange rates, including a substantially devalued Nigerian Naira partially offset by the lapping of other currencies year ago weakening, we would estimate a similar impact for the full year as that of the first half. A key message here is that these below-the-line items are collectively weighing down EPS as expected, but it is important to remember that the operational side of our P&L through operating profit remains very strong.\nTurning to Slide #15, we see that cash flow is below last year's high level. This is due to 3 factors: first, onetime cash outlays related to the spin-off amounting to roughly million. Secondly, lapping unusually strong inflows in the year ago period, including some related to derivatives. And thirdly, timing of capital expenditure which last year was much more weighted to the second half due to supply disruptions early that year. So while it is down from a high level last year, we believe cash flow is right on track to achieve our full year guidance. Meanwhile, we continue to reduce our debt leverage year-on-year, further enhancing our financial flexibility.\nAll in, our second quarter performance puts us slightly ahead of pace for the full year. Accordingly, we are once again moving up our full year guidance, as shown on Slide #16. We are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to approximately 7%, which is the high end of our previous guidance range. Our quarter 2 performance was consistent with our assumption of decelerating growth as the year progresses, which reflects a likely return of elasticity towards historical levels as well as lapping of particularly substantial revenue growth management actions in the second half of last year. This 7% organic growth is well above our long-term target.\nWe are raising our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth to 9% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis, which is the upper half of our previous guidance range. This raise reflects a stronger-than-expected quarter 2 performance particularly our earlier recovery in gross profit margin and yet still accounts for some investment shifts into the second half as well as incremental costs in the second half for operating W.K. Kellogg Company in parallel as a company within a company. We expect to improve margins this year, which combined with our above-target net sales growth, will deliver operating profit growth that is also above our long-term target. Based on the improved operating profit outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance as well.\nNow looking for a year-on-year decline of 1% to 2% and the upper portion of our previous guidance range. Remember that all and more of this decline is explained by the year-on-year reduction in pension and post retirement income, a nonoperating, noncash item that is expected to have a negative impact of nearly 7% on EPS this year. The negative impact of higher interest expense due to higher interest rates in the economy is another negative impact of more than 4%. If it weren't for these 2 macro-related impacts, our guidance for EPS growth would also be well above our long-term growth rate. Our guidance for cash flow remains at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Recall that within this guidance, we are expecting a year-on-year increase in our underlying cash flow, offset by onetime cash costs and capital related to the spin-off.\nA couple of elements to keep in mind regarding this guidance. First, while we expect the spinoff to be transacted during quarter 4, our guidance assumes it takes place at year-end purely for simplicity reasons. And secondly, the impact of our recently completed divestiture of our Russian business does not have a material impact on our guidance.\nSo to summarize our financial position on Slide 17. I Quarter 2 was yet another quarter of over delivery, and we have plans in place to sustain our earnings momentum. Accordingly, we are again raising our full year guidance for 2023. Our profit margins have expanded sooner than anticipated, and they should continue, particularly as our service levels return to normal. Our net sales growth remained strong. And while we are keeping our assumption of rising elasticity in the second half, along with lapping sizable revenue growth management actions, we are confident enough in our top line growth to raise our full year outlook.\nOur financial flexibility is strong, marked by a solid balance sheet and cash flow that remains in good shape even with some adverse timing in the first half. We continue to make good progress on setting up both Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg for operational and financial success, and we are looking forward to sharing with you the 2 companies' exciting strategies, capital structures, and financial outlooks next week. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to walk you through our individual businesses.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Kellogg Co.\n\nThanks, Amit. With the spin-off approaching, we'll once again organize our discussion around the businesses that will comprise Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg. Slide #19 reminds you of the composition of the 2 businesses. And on this slide, you can see how both remain in good form with good top line growth. Let's start by discussing the Kellanova businesses, leading off with our emerging markets regions.\nSlide #20 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. This region sustained its outstanding underlying momentum in the second quarter, posting mid-teens organic net sales growth on top of extremely strong comparisons. It again expanded its operating profit margin year-on-year in the second quarter, and it again posted exceptional 19% operating profit growth. and this performance came in spite of exceedingly high cost inflation and reinvestment into the business. Drilling down into its key category groups we see on Slide #21 that EMEA snacks sustained double-digit organic net sales growth in quarter 2, with this growth coming on top of exceptional growth in the year ago quarter.\nIn markets, snacks category growth rates remained elevated and have even accelerated slightly from the previous quarter. Pringles this year has outpaced the salty snacks category that is growing in the high teens or better across key markets and during the second quarter, we continued to gain share in markets like Australia, Japan, Korea and Thailand.\nEMEA cereal is also sustaining strong growth momentum, as shown on Slide #22. This business delivered growth on top of last year's strong growth with particular strength in Australia, Africa and the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey subregion. And in market, we've outpaced the category this year that has grown in the mid-single digits collectively across key markets, which brings us to noodles and other and Slide #23. Led by Multipro in Nigeria, this business continued to deliver organic net sales growth in excess of 20% in the second quarter. Multipro continues to execute extremely well, widening its competitive moat and staying on an impressive growth trajectory in an always exciting market. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our Kellogg Noodles business outside of Nigeria.\nIn the second quarter, net sales of Kellogg's Noodles grew significantly year-on-year in both South Africa and Egypt. As you know, the Nigerian Naira has been officially devalued recently but our team has been proactively managing through de facto currency devaluation for some time in order to protect our margins. Much of this proactive pricing, which has contributed to the 20% plus growth you see on the slide, is behind us now. This reflects the experience and savvy of our local team and the strength of this business, and we expect continued if moderated top line growth going forward.\nClearly, EMEA is a growth engine for Kellogg Company and soon Kellanova, and it is performing extremely well so far in 2023. For the full year, we continue to expect sustained momentum across all 3 category groups delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth and while improving our profit margins.\nLet's turn to our other emerging markets region, Latin America, starting on Slide #25. Kellogg Latin America in the second quarter delivered another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of equally strong growth last year. This growth was led by our 2 largest markets, Mexico and Brazil. We again expanded our operating margin in the second quarter, leading to another quarter of operating profit growth of 20% year-on-year.\nAs shown on Slide #26, our Snacks business in Latin America was up against an unusually high comparison in the second quarter, but its organic net sales growth was a solid 6% year-on-year through the first half. In market, we saw sustained double-digit growth for the salty snacks category in Mexico and Brazil, and Pringles has gained share in both of these key markets. We also outpaced a very strong portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico and stabilized our share in cookies in Brazil.\nOn Slide #27, you can see that Kellogg Latin America again recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal. This growth was broad-based with good growth across each of our subregions. In markets, cereal category growth rates remain robust in the region, and in the second quarter, we kept pace in Mexico, and we gained share in Brazil and Puerto Rico. So Latin America continues to perform well and remains right on track. For the full year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong top line momentum with growth in both snacks and cereal and continued recovery in its profit margins. all while working on separating its Caribbean cereal business as part of the spinoff. Once again, we can see that both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects.\nNow let's turn to our developed markets, starting with Kellogg Europe and Slide #29. The region posted sustained top line growth accelerating to 11% organic growth in the second quarter. Operating profit declined once again due to Russia, which we divested just after the end of the quarter. Excluding Russia, Kellogg Europe's operating profit increased in the mid-single digits in spite of extremely high cost pressures. So our underlying European business is performing very well.\nOn Slide #30, you can see that snacks, which represent just over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe continue to lead our growth in this region. In fact, quarter 2 marked the eighth quarter in the last 10 in which we have posted double-digit growth in our European snacks business. This was growth on top of strong year-ago growth, and it was driven by both volume and price mix. The growth was also broad-based with double-digit gains in all subregions, except for suspended shipments into Russia.\nIn market, the salty snacks category remains in strong double-digit growth across key markets with Pringles gaining share in key markets like Italy and France and sustaining strong consumption growth in spite of lapping notably robust year ago performance in markets like the U.K., Germany and Spain. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are experiencing double-digit consumption growth overall in the region paced by a 2-point share gain in the U.K. led by Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe, shown on Slide #31, also sustained growth in the second quarter. Growth has slowed as we've discussed previously, owing to category elasticities rising, but we continue to execute well in a challenging market.\nSo it was another good quarter for Kellogg Europe, keeping us right on track for another good year. For the full year, we continue to expect the region to post yet another year of solid top line growth, led by Snacks. We'll continue to navigate through cost pressures, which were particularly heavy in the first half, and we have a plan to gradually improve margins during the second half. And as we mentioned, we have closed on our divestiture of our Russia business.\nWe'll now turn to Kellogg North America and Slide #33. As anticipated, net sales growth decelerated in the second quarter as elasticity continued to move higher and as we lapped last year's sizable replenishment of trade inventories. However, mid-teens price mix growth was sustained and we delivered solid organic growth in net sales. Importantly, we continue to recover gross profit margin, reflecting productivity, revenue growth management and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages. This enabled us to increase investments in our brands and still deliver 14% operating profit growth year-on-year. This region again generated organic net sales growth in all 3 category groups in the second quarter. Slide #34 shows snacks, which represents over half of our North American net sales. In the second quarter, it grew net sales by 5% on top of a notably strong year earlier quarter, which had included retailer inventory replenishment.\nWe also grew in frozen foods, shown on Slide #35. In market, Eggo's consumption growth improved in the second quarter, continuing to moderate its share losses as our supply has improved. And Morningstar Farms gained share in the quarter as its supply is improving as well. All of the regions and categories we have discussed up to now will be part of Kellanova, and all of them are showing continued net sales growth to go with progress towards recovering margins.\nNow let's turn to our North America cereal business which forms the vast majority of what will soon be W.K. Kellogg Co. As shown on Slide #36, this business continues to recover, growing its net sales in the second quarter despite lapping substantial retailer inventory replenishment last year. In the U.S. the category remained in high single-digit growth in spite of gradually rising elasticities. Led by brands like Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and Raisin brand, we continue to gain share year-on-year and we continue to activate more commercial support, increase our distribution and increase our velocities. A similar recovery is happening in Canada, where we also continued to gain share in the second quarter. So this business is back on solid footing with more to come.\nTurning to Slide #37. Our North America region had a very strong first half, giving us confidence in our full year expectations. Snacks should remain solidly in growth while Frozen is expected to continue to show improved performance, and our North America cereal business continues its recovery. We are off to an earlier-than-expected start to margin recovery in this region even as we reinvest more in our brands. So North America is in good shape as we set up for the spin-off of W.K. Kellogg Co. later this year.\nSo let me summarize on Slide #39. We continue to put up better-than-expected results. Our first half featured top line growth across our regions and across our categories with notable momentum in snacks around the world and our businesses in emerging markets. It also featured an earlier-than-expected recovery in profit margins, which enables us to reinvest in the business and sustain strong earnings and cash flow growth.\nThanks to the passion and skill of our organization, we have not allowed the spin-off work to prevent us from delivering and even overdelivering on our plans. In fact, we're halfway through the year, and we've already raised our full year outlook twice. And the work we are doing for the spin-off will pay off. We are separating this great company into 2, even better companies, one with enhanced focus and the fit-for-purpose strategy and resourcing it deserves and the other with a portfolio-oriented solidly towards growth. And we'll share with you our plans for both companies at our Day 8-K investor event next week. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\n\nJohn P. Renwick\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Planning, Kellogg Co.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2023. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as project performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. And concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring -- to for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Kellogg Co.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be able to report a very strong start to the year. In fact, it was stronger than we had anticipated and puts us in the enviable position of being able to raise our outlook for the full year. Our top line growth momentum continues, as shown on Slide #5. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. And beneath the magnitude of our Q1 growth are promising trends. We continue to deliver above our long-term growth target.\nWe continue to deliver broad-based growth across each of our 4 regions and across each of our 4 major category groups. Our soon-to-be Kellanova businesses continued to grow strongly, led by snacks in emerging markets all paced by our highly differentiated world-class brands. Our soon-to-be W.K. Kellogg Co businesses continue to show recovery in net sales, consumption and share. We have continued to execute revenue growth management actions across our businesses right through the first quarter in order to keep up with high input.\nAnd we have supported our growth with sustained innovation and with the supply improving, increased brand-building investment. So we feel very good about our top line growth momentum and outlook. We also feel good about restoring our profit margins. We said that this would be a year in which we stabilize and even improve our margins after being pressured the last couple of years by soaring input cost inflation, and inefficiencies and costs related to bottlenecks and shortages.\nThe chart on Slide #6 shows that margins are indeed stabilizing. In fact, better-than-expected margins are what drove most of the first quarter overdelivery versus our expectations. Aside from what we're lapping -- underlying margin performance is what gives us increased confidence in the full year. Firstly, we continue to execute well on productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions both of which are starting to more fully catch up with our input cost inflation.\nSecond, we continue to improve our service levels and the bottlenecks and shortages that had created\n[Audio Gap]\nare finally receding. So while costs remain high, we are pleased with the profit margin recovery. And it's not just the financials that are off to a good start in 2023. Kellogg's Better Days promise, our social and environmental program continues to be a strategic priority for us. And as shown on Slide #7, we were as active as ever in these areas during the first quarter. From actions visible in the marketplace, the philanthropic and sustainability activities in the middle column action-oriented approach. And the far right column shows that these actions continue to be recognized.\nWe believe ESG is one of Kellogg Company's differentiating strengths and will continue to be when we are Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg. And speaking of Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg, we are very pleased with how our spin-off work is progressing. Slide #8 offers a high-level time line of the work we are doing in order to be able to set up both companies for success, provide you with the strategic and financial information you need and execute the transaction. Everything is progressing well. The announcement of new company names has been well received by stakeholders.\nThe organizational design work is finishing up with leadership team members already announced and the remainder of talent placements coming later in the second quarter. The design and setup of systems and processes for W.K. Kellogg is underway and various post-spin transition services continue to be ironed out. Prior year carve-out financials are being prepared, and we expect to have them audited in the next couple of months.\nDuring the third quarter, we plan to test run W.K. Kellogg on its own from procurement to manufacturing to invoicing to financials and best of all employee sentiment and engagement remain very high. We expect to be able to provide you with information via a Form 10 sometime in late summer, followed by an investor event likely in late third quarter, during which we will be able to share with you the strategies, capital structures and financial outlooks for both companies. That will all lead to the transaction, which takes place in the fourth quarter.\nAgain, some of this is dependent on timing of regulatory and other customary approvals, but it should give you assurance that the information and transaction are not\n[Audio Gap]\nand most importantly, all of this preparation work has only that this spinoff creates value for shareowners. We are setting up both companies for success. W.K. Kellogg co will benefit from focus and resource prioritization. And Kellanova will be a higher-growth company with 80% of sales coming from snacks and emerging markets. Now let me turn it over to Amit, who will provide you the financial details of our first quarter and full year outlook.\n\nAmit Banati\n\nVice Chairman, Senior VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide #10 -- quarter financial results. Obviously, it was a very strong start to the year. Our 14% organic net sales growth was driven by sustained growth in price and mix. Net sales were better than expected, principally because of volume.\n[Audio Gap]\nOn profit margins than we had expected leading to a very strong 18% operating profit on a currency-neutral basis. This higher operating profit drove adjusted earnings per share to be 3% higher than last year on a currency-neutral basis. Remember, this growth is in spite of significant macro-related headwinds items. In fact, higher interest expense and lower pension accounting income pulled EPS down by about 5 and 8 percentage points, respectively, year-on-year in the quarter.\nCash flow in the first 3 months decreased year-on-year as expected. This is related to the payout of 2022's incentive compensation in quarter 1, cash outlets related to the spin-off and the timing of certain working capital items and capital\n[Audio Gap]\nNow let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide #11 lays out the components of our strong net sales growth in quarter 1. Price mix growth was sustained in the mid-teens, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives around the world -- in 2022 and right through quarter 1, 2023 as we -- set high input cost inflation. Volume declined, reflecting price elasticity though not as much as we had expected for quarter 1. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales by about 3 points, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar against key currencies versus the prior year.\nAs we'll discuss in a moment, we are raising our organic net sales guidance for the year. Our outlook continues to prudently assume that price elasticities will sustain their upward move towards historical levels. And depending on the direction of input cost inflation, that price mix will begin to lap last year's sizable revenue growth management actions. Nonetheless, there's no\n[Audio Gap]\nposting better-than-expected growth yet again in quarter 1, indicating momentum in our business, giving us good confidence in our outlook. Next, let's review our gross profit performance on Slide #12. As we've discussed numerous times, our objective in this high inflation environment has been to protect gross profit dollars via productivity savings and revenue growth management. As you can see good job at this, even and transitory impact in quarter 4, 2021 and quarter 1, 2022 of a fire and strike. And we've done this in spite of economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, which have created significant inefficiencies and incremental costs.\nIn the first quarter, we made our most progress yet. Productivity and revenue growth management continue to catch up to a high market-driven input cost inflation. Bottlenecks and shortages did diminish in the quarter a little sooner than we had projected. We did lap a negative residual impact from the fire and strike, but even excluding that estimated impact from last year, our gross profit dollars increased year-on-year. We also improved gross profit on a percentage margin basis as we lap the fire and strike and narrowed our underlying margin decline by more than we expected.\nOur plan was always to have a better second half than first half due to gradually improving supply conditions and the lapping of accelerated input cost inflation. This quarter 1 performance gives us that much more confidence that we can finish the year better than the flattish margin we had discussed previously.\nSlide #13\n[Audio Gap]\nquarterly year-on-year changes this year are greatly affected by year ago comparisons. As expected, our SG&A in this year's quarter 1 increased at a double-digit rate year-on-year. as we lap an unusual decline in the year earlier period. That was when brand building had been pulled back because of supply disruptions, most notably during North America cereal inventory rebuild and as we lapped overhead, that was low, a bit of low travel and meetings during the pandemic. As you can see on the slide, we start to lap a resumption of brand building and travel and meetings in quarter 2, but it was really the second half last -- toward full restoration of both and also raised our incentive compensation accruals. But in absolute numbers, we feel good about our levels of investment in brands and capabilities, and we remain on track for the full year.\nMoving to Slide #14, we can see that our growth in net sales and gross profit were more than enough to cover this year-on-year rise in SG&A expense, resulting in a 18% currency-neutral growth an adjusted basis operating profit. This is a fourth straight quarter of solid year-on-year growth. Importantly, we have sustained a multiyear upward trajectory on operating profit. Even excluding from the year earlier quarter, an estimated impact of the fire and strike, we continue to grow our dollars year-on-year. In fact, our quarter\n[Audio Gap]\nthan previous year's quarter 1 operating profit as well, even dating back to prior to the Kibler divestiture. So obviously, a strong start to the year, and this gives us the confidence to raise our full year guidance. Moving down the income statement. Slide #15 shows growth was more than enough to offset what were severe\n[Audio Gap]\nbelow-the-line items. These below-the-line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year due to higher interest rates. In dollars, we should see\n[Audio Gap]\nin each of the remaining Other income decreased sharply year-on-year, reflecting accounting of pension and post-retirement plan asset values and interest rates stemming from last year's decline in financial markets. Because of some favorability in some other items in this line, this quarter 1 figure is probably a little higher than what we will see in the remaining quarters. Our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected, largely due to country mix and some other differences, and it was a little above a tax rate of about 22%.\nAverage shares outstanding were up slightly year-on-year, and we would expect that to be the case for the full year as well. In addition, foreign currency translation was a headwind of a little more than 2%\n[Audio Gap]\nsee foreign currency translation out of our guidance because it is out of our control and difficult to predict. But today's exchange rates would suggest a smaller impact in each remaining quarter finishing the year with a negative impact of 1% to 2%. So while these below-the-line items are weighing down EPS as expected, it is important to remember that the operational side of our P&L through operating profit is very strong.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow and balance sheet on Slide #16. As I mentioned earlier, our cash flow in quarter 1 was lower than last year's as we had expected. In addition to lapping a particularly strong year ago period, this quarter, we experienced the payout of 2022's incentive compensation as well as incremental cash outlays related to the spin-off. Cash flow was also impacted year-on-year capital and capital expenditure. We remain on track for our full year guidance. Meanwhile, our net debt has been trending lower contributing to our strong financial flexibility.\nSo let's now summarize our guidance on Slide #17. Keep in mind that while we expect the spin-off\n[Audio Gap]\nquarter 4, our guidance assumes, it takes place at year end reasons. Similarly, while the divestiture of our Russian business awaits government approval, our guidance assumes it remains in our portfolio for the full year, and the divestiture impact will be immaterial to adjusted basis EPS. We are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to 6% to 7%, reflecting our better-than-expected performance in quarter 1, which continued to demonstrate price realization and solid momentum across\n[Audio Gap]\nwe maintain our assumption for decelerating growth as the year progresses, which reflects a likely return of elasticity towards historical levels as well as lapping a particularly substantial revenue growth management actions in the second half of last year. This 6% to 7% organic growth is well above our long-term target. We are raising our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth to 8% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis. This percentage point increase to the range reflects our stronger-than-expected quarter 1. We feel increasingly confident in our ability to improve margins this year, which combined with our above-target net sales growth, will deliver operating profit growth that is also above our long-term target.\nBased on that improved operating profit outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance as well, now looking for a year-on-year decline of 1% to 3%. Remember that this decline is more than explained by the year-on-year reduction in pension and postretirement income, a nonoperating noncash item that is expected to have a negative impact of nearly 7 percentage points on EPS this year. The negative impact of higher interest expense due to higher interest rates in the economy is another 4% plus. If it wasn't for those 2 macro related impacts, our guidance for EPS would be well above our long-term growth target.\nOur guidance for cash flow remains at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Recall that within this guidance, we are expecting a year-on-year increase in our underlying cash flow, offset by onetime cash costs and capital related to the spin-off. So to summarize our financial position, sustained price realization continue to generate strong top line growth around the world and across our category groups. We like how our businesses are performing, and we have confidence in our full year sales outlook.\nProductivity and revenue growth management action, along with diminishing bottlenecks and shortages and improving service levels have gotten us off to a good start towards improving our profit margins. Our financial flexibility is strong, marked by a solid balance sheet and cash flow that remains in good shape even with some adverse timing in the first 3 months. Our guidance for 2023 has moved higher, continuing to expect net sales growth and operating profit growth that are above our long-term targets.\nThe fast start of quarter 1 gives us that much more confidence in this full year outlook, even giving us some flexibility relative to readying ourselves for the spinoff. We continue to make good progress on setting up both Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg for financial success. In addition to carving out of their financials, we are managing upfront expenditures, minimizing stand-alone costs for W.K. Kellogg and stranded margin for Kellanova and we are ensuring solid capital structures and financial flexibility for both. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to walk you through our individual businesses.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Kellogg Co.\n\nThanks, Amit. We'll organize our discussion around the businesses that will comprise Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg. Slide #20 reminds you of the composition of the 2 businesses. And on the slide, you can see how our top line momentum in quarter 1 continued to expand across our portfolio with both Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg posting double-digit organic net sales growth. Clearly, we are heading into the spin-off with good momentum.\nLet's start by discussing the Kellanova businesses, leading off with our emerging markets regions. Slide #21 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. As you can see, this region sustained its exceptional momentum in the first quarter, posting a third consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth of at least 20%. And equally impressive, it expanded its operating profit margin and accelerated its operating profit growth to 21% year-on-year and all this in spite of exceedingly high cost inflation and reinvestment into the business.\nLet's break the region down into key category groups, starting with Snacks on Slide #22. EMEA Snacks posted yet another quarter of explosive top line growth in the first quarter growing net sales at organic rate of 26% year-on-year. This growth was broad-based across all of our major subregions and it was led by its biggest brand, Pringles. In market, Pringles continues to significantly outpace the high-teens growth of the salty snacks category in the region with notable growth and share gains in markets like Australia, Korea, Japan and Thailand.\nEMEA Cereal also sustained strong momentum. As shown on Slide #23, this business delivered double-digit organic net sales growth again in the first quarter. And this growth was broad-based with growth across each of our major subregions, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey region. In market, we have outpaced the cereal category's mid-single-digit consumption growth in the region, which brings us to noodles and other in Slide #24.\nAnd Led by Multipro in Nigeria, this business continued to deliver organic net sales growth in excess of 20% in the first quarter. Even amidst high inflation and a currency demonetization initiative multipro continued to thrive, clear evidence of its competitive advantage and experienced management team. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our Kellogg Noodles business outside of Nigeria. So clearly, Kellogg EMEA is firing on all cylinders. For the full year, we continue to expect sustained momentum across all 3 category groups delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth all while improving our profit margins.\nNow let's discuss Latin America, starting on Slide #26. Kellogg Latin America in the first quarter delivered another quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. This growth was led by Mexico, but we also saw strong growth in Brazil in our Central America and Caribbean subregion. We expanded our operating margin in the first quarter, helping to grow our operating profit by 20% year-on-year, albeit lapping notably high costs in the year earlier quarter.\nOur snacks business in Latin America continued to deliver double-digit organic net sales growth, as shown on Slide #27. This growth was led by Pringles with notably strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. In market, the salty snacks category sustained double-digit growth in those 2 markets and Pringles gained share in both. We also have kept pace with a very strong portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico and stabilized our share in cookies in Brazil.\nKellogg Latin America also recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal as shown on Slide #28. This growth was broad-based with good growth across each of our subregions. In market, category growth rates remained robust in the region, and our consumption has kept pace in Mexico and gained share in Brazil and Puerto Rico. So Latin America continues to perform well. And for the year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong top line momentum. It will be led by snacks, but also by growth in cereal, with both supported by strong innovation and relevant brand news. We also expect Latin America to improve its profit margins this year, and it plans to do all this while working on separating its Caribbean cereal business as part of the spin-off. So both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects.\nNow let's turn to our developed markets, starting with Kellogg Europe in Slide #30. Here, we continue to post strong 8% organic net sales growth in quarter 1 with organic growth across our categories, salty snacks, wholesome snacks and cereal. The Kellogg Europe net sales growth would have been in the double digits were it not for Russia, which we are in the process of divesting. Operating profit declined slightly year-on-year, but it was comparing against an unusually strong year earlier quarter. In addition, if we were to exclude the Russia business, Kellogg Europe's operating profit would have been up year-on-year in the high single digits. So our underlying European business is performing very well.\nIn Snacks, which represents just over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe, we posted another strong quarter as shown on Slide 31. In fact, the first quarter marked the seventh quarter in the last 9 in which we have posted double-digit growth in our European Snacks business. Specifically, our organic net sales growth accelerated sequentially in the first quarter to 14% year-on-year, and this growth would have been almost twice that if it were not for Russia. In market, Pringles has sustained its double-digit growth momentum, gaining share in the region led by the United Kingdom and France. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are experiencing double-digit consumption growth overall, and we have gained 2 full share points in the U.K., led by Rice Krispies Squares.\nOur cereal business in Europe also sustained growth in the first quarter, as shown on Slide #32. The growth was slower than recent quarters as we have seen rising price elasticity as well as intentional reduction of certain less profitable merchandising activities. Nevertheless, we continue to execute well in a challenging market. So when we look at the full year for Kellogg Europe, we continue to expect the region to post another year of solid top line growth led by Snacks. In fact, this should be a sixth consecutive year of organic net sales growth in our European Snacks business.\nAs mentioned previously, we are navigating through cost and supply pressures, which are particularly heavy in the first half. And we are in the process of divesting our Russia business, a transaction that is contingent on Russian government approval. And now we'll turn to Kellogg North America, beginning with Slide #34. As you can see, it was a very strong quarter for Kellogg North America. We recorded organic net sales growth of 14% with price/mix accelerating for a fourth consecutive quarter as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions in order to catch up with input cost inflation.\nThis revenue growth management, along with productivity and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages enabled an expansion in profit margins that drove operating profit up 21% year-on-year. Importantly, we again generated organic net sales growth in all 3 category groups during the first quarter. Slide #35 shows how our largest category group, snacks, sustained its net sales momentum by growing 15% in the quarter. In market, Pringles well outpaced the U.S. salty snacks categories double-digit growth, led by our multipacks and our Core 4 flavors.\nIn crackers, Cheese lapped an exceptionally strong year earlier quarter, but we did see double-digit consumption growth by our club and townhouse brands. And in portable wholesome snacks, our decision to discontinue various Kashi bars and the prioritization of capacity-constrained pop tarts SKUs, masked continued momentum in Rice Krispies Treats and a resurgent Special K bars business.\nOur frozen foods business also grew net sales in the first quarter, as shown on Slide #36. Here the growth has been more modest in part because of supply disruptions, both in our Eggo frozen breakfast business and especially in our Morningstar Farms plant-based foods business. Meantime, both Eggo and Morningstar Farms are leading brands with strong commercial programs planned so we are confident in our ability to improve our frozen performance as the year progresses.\nAll of the regions and categories we've discussed up to now will be part of Kellanova, and all of them are showing strong and continued net sales growth to go with progress toward recovering margins. Now we're going to turn to our North America cereal business, which forms the vast majority of what will be W.K. Kellogg Co.\nAs shown on Slide #37, this business continues to recover rapidly and posted another quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. In the U.S., the cereal category grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, and we gained nearly 3 points of share year-on-year as our resumed commercial activity is producing share gains across our portfolio led by Rice Krispies, Special K, Raisin Bran and Frosted Flakes. This recovery is evident in our U.S. Away from Home business as well. We gained several points of share across each of our major channels convenience stores, food service and schools.\nAnd in Canada, where the restoration of inventory has come a bit more recently, our consumption growth has been more pronounced, and we gained roughly 6 points of share share year-on-year. So the recovery continues in our North America cereal business. Turning to Slide #38, our North America region is off to a strong start in 2023, giving us confidence in the full year. Snacks is expected to sustain its momentum, while we have plans in place to improve our performance in frozen and our North America cereal business continues its recovery. We are off to a good start on our margin recovery in North America even as we reinvest in our brands. So the business is in good shape as we set up for the spin-off of W.K. Kellogg.\nSo let me summarize on Slide #40. We're off to a very strong start to this year. around the world and across our key categories and brands, we have clearly sustained growth momentum. And our profit margins impacted over the last 18 months by accelerated input cost inflation, economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages and even if fire and strikes are starting to recover. These underlying trends with a strong first quarter already in the books are what give us increased confidence in a raised full year outlook that had already called for sales and profit growth above our long-term targets.\nBut while we are executing our plan and delivering on our current year results, we are also busy creating the future. This includes most notably our planned spin-off of our North America cereal business. We are full steam ahead on this work as we work through every detail of this important undertaking, we have become only more confident that this will create real value for our shareowners. We'll have a more focused W.K. Kellogg able to leverage its scale in North America cereal with a fit-for-purpose strategy, expertise and resource allocation. and we'll have greater visibility into a global snacking-oriented Kellanova that has been and will continue to be delivering above-average financial performance.\nI couldn't be more proud of and grateful for our team members around the world who are executing with agility and passion amidst an external environment that remains incredibly dynamic. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\n\nJohn P. Renwick\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Planning, Kellogg Company\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as our outlook for 2023. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.\nSlide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is of particular note amidst the current operating environment, which includes unusually high input cost inflation, global supply disruptions and other uncertain global macroeconomic conditions, all of whose direction, length and severity are so difficult to predict.\nA recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com.\nAs always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.\nAnd now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter completed what was an excellent year, competitively, financially and in terms of the grit and skill our organization demonstrated in executing through what were truly extraordinary circumstances. The strength of our snacks portfolio was clearly evident with double-digit net sales growth across all regions, underpinned by strong end-market performance.\nWe sustained exceptional growth in emerging markets, led by our noodles and other portfolio in Africa, but also posting strong growth in snacks and cereal across AMEA and Latin America. We mitigated the profit impact of unusually high input costs that accelerated during the year, leaning into productivity and carefully executed revenue growth management actions. We navigated through economy-wide supply bottlenecks and shortages and work to restore capacity in much of our business, most notably in North America cereal and North America frozen foods. The result of all of this was strong financial delivery that exceeded expectations throughout the year, prompting us to raise guidance more than once this year for net sales, operating profit and EPS and still over-deliver that guidance, thanks to a strong fourth quarter.\nWe also announced, planned and made significant progress towards a separation of our company that will not only improve performance of North America Cereal Co. but provide clearer visibility into the strength of the snacks-oriented parent company.\nWith all of this going on and amidst global supply disruptions and high costs, we kept our focus on sustaining momentum in all of our businesses. We stay true to our Deploy for Growth strategy, leveraging our growth shape portfolio, orienting our brand building and innovation toward winning occasions and sustaining momentum in our biggest world-class brands, all while working to restore service levels and leveraging all levers of revenue growth management in an attempt to keep up with soaring cost inflation.\nThe results of this focus on sustaining momentum are shown clearly in our organic net sales growth, which is shown on Slide #6. Not only did our sales come in ahead of expectations every quarter, but our growth accelerated sequentially every quarter. And this growth was impressively broad-based in all 4 of our regions and in all 4 of our major category groups: snacks, cereal, frozen and noodles and other.\nWe also remain committed to our Better Days strategy towards environmental, social and governance practices. Slide #7 shows some examples of tangible actions take and recognitions received during the fourth quarter alone, illustrating this continued commitment. And you can expect us to maintain this focus on execution and reliable financial delivery in 2023.\nSlide #8 shows that you can expect many of the same drivers of this financial delivery as we saw in 2022. Our snacks business, which is roughly half of today's Kellogg Company, should see sustained momentum led by truly world-class brands.\nIn our strong emerging markets businesses, we expect to continue to drive growth and manage through what are always interesting macroeconomic conditions. Input cost inflation remains high, which means we will again be focused on realizing productivity and cost savings, supplemented by utilizing all levers of our database revenue growth management disciplines around the world.\nAnd we continue to progress on our supply recovery in specific businesses. As a result, we are forecasting growth in net sales and operating profit that are above our long-term targets, even as we continue to invest in the enhancement of capabilities, service levels and the strength of our brands.\nMeanwhile, we continue to march toward the separation into more focused companies, starting with the spin-off of North America Cereal Co. still scheduled for late this year. Work has progressed on the carving out of financials, the designing of new organizations and the separation of key systems and processes.\nSeparately, you'll recall that we were exploring strategic options for the plant-based food business, which represents about 2% of our company's net sales. Given current market conditions as well as our confidence in this business as a long-term growth vehicle, we have decided to retain it as part of Global Snacking Co. We remain as confident as ever in the value to be created by making Global Snacking Co. and North America Cereal Co. more focused with better visibility into and valuation of their performance and outlook. In short, we are poised for another good year of results.\nBefore discussing our businesses in detail, let me now turn it over to Amit for a review of our financials.\n\nAmit Banati\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide #9 provides a summary of our '22 financial results. A better-than-expected performance in quarter 4 drove us to hit or exceed our guidance for the full year. Our net sales led the way, accelerating to 16% organic growth in the fourth quarter and resulting in 12% organic growth for the year, which was higher than expected. This top line growth more than offset a sizable year-on-year increase in investment, resulting in an adjusted basis operating profit growing 20% on a currency-neutral basis in quarter 4. This brought our full year growth to 7%, also exceeding expectations.\nOur adjusted basis earnings per share increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis in quarter 4 despite being weighed down by the as-anticipated increase in interest expense and reduction in pension income related to the decline in financial markets. This quarter 4 performance resulted in full year EPS growth of 5% on a currency-neutral adjusted basis ahead of our expectations.\nCash flow came in at about $1.2 billion, an increase from the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluded from our currency-neutral results, of course, is foreign currency translation, which reduced our net sales, operating profit and earnings per share by about 4 percentage points in quarter 4 and about the same for the full year EPS.\nNow let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide #11 lays out the components of our strong net sales growth. Our double-digit organic growth in net sales in 2022 was driven by price/mix, which accelerated in the second half as we continue to execute revenue growth management actions around the world to cover accelerated input cost inflation.\nVolume grew slightly in the quarter due to the continued recovery in North America Cereal and declined only modestly for the full year, reflecting both price elasticity that has not moved up as much or as soon as we had expected, as well as our replenishment of trade inventories during the year as our supply improved. Foreign currency translation was a headwind all year with particularly adverse impact in quarter 3 and quarter 4.\nLet's discuss gross profit on Slide #12. Supply disruptions created incremental costs and inefficiencies throughout the year, and input cost inflation accelerated across the year. Yet because of productivity efforts and effective revenue growth management actions around the world, we were able to largely offset the dollar impact of those higher input costs, and we grew our overall gross profit dollars this year. In fact, our gross profit dollars came in higher than expected both in quarter 4 and the full year.\nFrom a percentage margin perspective, though, there is a mechanical impact of matching input cost inflation with price realization, and because we could not cover the unpredictable inefficiencies from economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages. We did see a year-on-year increase in gross profit margin in quarter 4 as we lapped the first of 2 quarters impacted by the fire and strike, and we finished the full year in line with expectations we had communicated.\nIn 2023, we expect to continue to grow gross profit dollars while our margin stabilizes and improve slightly during the year. Some of this is related to the fire and strike impact being onetime in nature, largely isolated to quarter 4 '21 and quarter 1 '22. And some of it will come from bottlenecks and shortages gradually diminishing, but this improved margin performance will also be driven by price realization catching up to input cost inflation that is expected to moderate in the back half of the year.\nMoving down the income statement on Slide #13. We see how our SG&A accelerated its year-on-year increase across the year, just as we said it would. After having been curved during severe supply disruptions, including the fire and strike in North America, our advertising and promotion investment was ramped back up in the second half and finished the year roughly flat with 2021. Overhead, meanwhile, increased year-on-year in all 4 quarters as we gradually returned to travel and meetings and as we accrued higher incentive compensation related to our above-budget financial performance. In 2023, the quarterly phasing of SG&A expense will be affected by lapping last year's North America Cereal pullback on brand building in the first half and rapid ramp-up in the second half.\nSlide #14 shows our continued upward trajectory on operating profit. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 16% year-on-year, including a negative currency translation impact of almost 4 percentage points. While it was lapping a year earlier decline due to last year's fire and strike, this year's quarter 4 profit was above that of 2 years ago. Importantly, it featured exceptional top line growth and a significant year-on-year increase in investment. For the full year, our operating profit increased by 4% after a negative 3% impact for currency translation. As you can see on the slide, this operating profit was not only higher than 2021, it was also higher than 2 and 3 years ago.\nSlide #15 shows our below-the-line items, which were again collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter and, therefore, the full year. Driven by nonoperating factors, there will be an even larger headwind in 2023. Interest expense was up sharply year-on-year in quarter 4 as rising interest rates affected the roughly 1/5 of our debt that is floating. The quarterly run rate for 2023 interest expense will likely be a bit higher than this quarter 4 level. Other income decreased in quarter 4 and the full year. Most of this was related to the midyear remeasurement of certain U.S. benefit plans, though, in quarter 4, it was partially offset by better-than-expected ForEx gains and interest income that we do not expect to repeat.\nAs we have discussed previously, the decline in benefit plan income is related to 2022's fall in financial markets, which reduced the value of planned assets and raised interest rates. We remeasured about half of our planned exposure in the second half of 2022, and 2023 will feel the impact of remeasuring all of our plans. Hence, we could see a year-on-year decline in other income in 2023 that is almost twice the decrease we recorded in 2022. Our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected in quarter 4 and, therefore, the full year, mostly reflecting geography mix. For 2023, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 22%.\nOur JV earnings and minority interests were collectively flattish year-on-year in quarter 4, finishing the year higher than last year, led by good performance by our joint ventures. Collectively, these are expected to be relatively flat in 2023. And average shares outstanding were flattish in 2022 as increased options exercises by employees over the course of the year offset the benefit of share buybacks executed early in the year.\nOur cash flow and balance sheet also remain in very good shape, as shown on Slide #16. Our cash flow increased year-on-year despite year-on-year swings in sales and receivables in December as we lapped last year's fire and strike. This increase in cash flow over the past few years has helped us to reduce our debt right through 2022, leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility even as we have continued to increase cash return to share owners in the form of an increased dividend and buybacks this year.\nLet's now pivot to 2023, starting with Slide #17, and some key assumptions behind our guidance. First, and most importantly, we expect to sustain our strong business momentum. Between price realization, the momentum of our categories and the strength of our brand plans, we are confident we can achieve another year of above-algorithm net sales growth. And while input cost inflation remains high, it should decelerate year-on-year in the second half, and the same can be said for bottlenecks and shortages. Therefore, we expect to generate above-algorithm growth for operating profit as well in 2023.\nNext, our guidance reflects the impact of headwinds on our nonoperating below-the-line items. Interest expense will increase substantially because of the rise in interest rates worldwide. And noncash pension income will drop sharply, owing to lower asset values entering the year and to a higher interest charge, reflecting the rise in interest rates. The pending spin-off of North America Cereal Co. is still targeted to be executed towards the end of the year. For simplicity reasons only, our guidance assumes it remains in our results for the full year.\nSlide #18 shows our guidance by key metric. Organic growth in net sales is forecast to be in the 5% to 7% range, another strong year. Given the cost environment, this growth will be weighted towards price/mix, reflecting revenue growth actions from both 2022 and this year. Importantly, this net sales growth is expected to be broad-based across our portfolio and led by momentum in snacks and in emerging markets. On an adjusted basis and excluding currency, we expect operating profit to grow in the 7% to 9% range. This above-target growth will be driven by the strong net sales, which drives the growth in gross profit dollars that fuel increased brand building.\nAt the earnings per share level, the strong operating profit growth will be more than offset by the pension and interest headwinds we discussed earlier. The impact of the accounting remeasurement of pension and post retirement alone is negative 7 percentage points to EPS growth. Again, it should be emphasized that this is a noncash, nonoperating item, and it was driven by what was a rare steep decline in the financial markets in 2022. Without that item, our EPS would be up 3% to 5%, even despite the higher interest expense and tax rate.\nCash flow is expected to come in somewhere between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Our underlying base business cash flow will continue to grow year-on-year, reaching $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, but there will be roughly $300 million plus of cash outlays related to the pending spin-off. This is a combination of cash costs and capital expenditure, all onetime in nature and all related to executing the transaction and setting up the stand-alone business.\nSo to summarize on Slide #19, we continue to feel very good about how we are performing and about our financial condition. Across our regions and category groups, we sustained solid momentum in 2022, and we expect that momentum to continue in 2023. Amidst high cost inflation across inputs and energy, we were able to protect profit dollars through productivity and revenue growth management in 2022, and we will do so again in 2023. In an environment of disruptions up and down the supply chain, we have executed well and steadily improved service levels in 2022 and will continue to do so in 2023.\nIn 2022, we delivered above-target growth in currency-neutral net sales and operating profit, and we plan on doing that again in 2023. We have increased our cash flow and further deleveraged our balance sheet, giving us excellent financial flexibility going into 2023. And we remain as confident as ever in the value that can be created by spinning off North America Cereal Co. Not only will that business thrive amidst increased focus, but the strength of the remaining Global Snacking Co. will be significantly more visible. So we are looking forward to another good year in 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss our individual businesses.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Amit. Let's start with Kellogg North America on Slide #21. As you can see, our largest region performed very well in 2022, straight through the fourth quarter. We started the year with a lingering inventory impact and costs arising from the second half 2021 fire and strike as well as other supply disruptions. And quarter-by-quarter, we executed well, both from a supply chain perspective and a commercial perspective, finishing the year with very strong net sales and operating profit growth.\nWithin North America, our largest segment is snacks, representing over half of our sales in the region. And this segment led the way in 2022, as shown on Slide #22. There was some timing of shipments, particularly year-over-year within the quarters, but North America snacks finished the year in double-digit growth. In fact, North America snacks has accelerated its organic net sales growth in each of the past 4 years. Leading the way were world-class brands like Pringles and Cheez-It, both of which generated double-digit consumption growth in 2022, and Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats, both of which sustained their multiyear momentum as well.\nOur North America cereal business, as depicted on Slide #23. This business overcame enormous obstacles on its way to delivering very strong net sales growth. We entered the year depleted on finished goods inventories. As we rebuilt those inventories SKU by SKU, we were able to replenish retailer shelves more quickly than we anticipated. And during the second half, we were able to ramp up our commercial programs, and we have entered the new year with real momentum.\nSlide #24 shows the end market progress we have made since restoring inventories and commercial activity. As you can see, our performance has continued to improve sequentially, accelerating both our consumption growth and our share recovery. This business is back on track and is poised to sustain growth in 2023 when we will have a full year of commercial activity. In addition, with supply back in place, this business has begun to restore its profit margins.\nNorth America frozen foods is shown on Slide #25. This was another business that ran into capacity and supply challenges in 2022. For Eggo, it was simply a matter of strong demand over the last couple of years, putting us up against capacity. We put in capacity at midyear and since that time, Eggo's consumption growth has accelerated. And for Morningstar Farms, we experienced significant production issues at a co-manufacturer. During the fourth quarter, supply came back online and almost immediately, we saw signs of improvement in market.\nSo moving to Slide #26. Kellogg North America has all the pieces in place for another good year in 2023. Our snacks brands are demonstrating undeniable momentum, and they represent more than half of our North America regions net sales. Our cereal business continues to outpace what has been very strong category sales growth as we continue to ramp up commercial activity. And our frozen businesses are getting past some severe supply constraints. Meanwhile, our productivity and revenue growth management actions are catching up to what has been steadily rising input cost inflation just as we are starting to see signs of bottlenecks and shortages receding. The result should be margin improvement for North America this year. And of course, North America will be moving full speed ahead with the carving out and spinning off of North America Cereal Co. We're making good progress with detailed implementation plans, all while remaining focused on delivering good financial results and executing in the marketplace.\nNow let's turn to Europe and Slide #27. Cost inflation accelerated faster in this region than others, particularly when energy prices and other costs soared after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Our revenue growth management actions have yet to catch up to the accelerated cost pressures, pulling down profit in the last couple of quarters and will likely remain a pressure on profits into the first half of 2023. The fourth quarter also featured a meaningful year-on-year increase in brand investment.\nNevertheless, Kellogg Europe had another good year, posting its fifth straight year of growth in both organic net sales and operating profit. Leading the way were snacks, which now represent more than half of our Europe region's net sales, as shown on Slide #28. And aside from the Russia impact in year-ago comparisons in quarter 3, this segment drove strong double-digit net sales growth all year. This momentum is not new. This was our fifth straight year of organic net sales growth for Europe snacks.\nIn-market, Pringles generated strong consumption growth across key markets in the quarter and the full year. And in the U.K., we also delivered rapid growth for Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares.\nTurning to our European cereal business and Slide #29, you can see that this business continues to deliver steady growth. On the strength of commercial activities and revenue growth management needed to cover rising costs, this business showed sequential acceleration in its organic net sales growth in each quarter.\nIn-market, category growth rates in markets across the region picked up in the fourth quarter, and we have been particularly pleased with accelerated growth and share gains for brands like Rice Krispies in the U.K., Tresor in France and Special K in several markets. So you can see that Kellogg Europe remains in very good condition as we head into 2023.\nAs indicated on Slide #30, we expect to sustain momentum in snacks led by Pringles, but also increasingly accompanied by portable wholesome snacks like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares.\nIn cereal, we have strong brand plans, including renovation and innovation and a campaign celebrating our 25th year of our Better Days social program in the U.K. We will continue to manage through cost and supply pressures, which are particularly heavy in the first half. And we have an agreement to divest our Russia business, though the deal's timing, approvals and final details are still pending. This business represents a little more than 5% of Kellogg Europe's total sales, so the impact of this divestiture should not be meaningful to adjusted basis results.\nNow let's turn to Latin America on Slide #31. As the chart shows, Kellogg Latin America grew net sales and operating profit strongly, both in the fourth quarter and full year. In fact, this region posted strong and accelerating organic net sales growth all year attributed to its brands, its commercial execution and its expansion of route-to-market capabilities as well as its revenue growth management actions and its agility in managing through supply challenges.\nOur snacks business in Latin America is shown on Slide #32. This business has grown consistently over the years. In 2022, it led the organic net sales growth for the region with year-on-year growth of more than 20% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. The growth was broad-based, finishing the year with the fourth quarter that featured strong double-digit net sales gains across all of our subregions, Mexico, Brazil, Pacific and the Caribbean and Central America region.\nThe strong growth in the quarter and year was driven by price/mix needed to cover soaring cost inflation and adverse transactional currency impact. And while volume did decline, the elasticity was below historical levels. In-market data showed sustained double-digit category growth in the quarter and the full year for our major salty snacks markets, with Pringles gaining share in both of its biggest Latin America markets, which are Mexico and Brazil.\nOur cereal business in Latin America also grew net sales organically in the fourth quarter and full year, as indicated on Slide #33. Early in the year, this business felt the impact of supply disruption coming out of North America's fire and strike, particularly in our Caribbean business. But as you can see, once that was behind us, our cereal net sales reaccelerated strongly. In-market, our consumption growth was robust across the region in the quarter and the full year, led by key brands like Frosted Flakes in Mexico and Brazil, Corn Flakes in Brazil and Puerto Rico, and Froot Loops in Colombia.\nSo moving on to Slide #34. Latin America, too, is poised for another good year in 2023. We expect to sustain momentum in snacks, led by Pringles, and we expect to continue to grow in cereal. We expect to improve profit margins this year, and work is well under way toward carving out our Caribbean cereal business into the North America Cereal Co. spin-off.\nWe'll finish up our regional review with AMEA, shown on Slide #35. This region continues to deliver exceptional top line and bottom line growth. Net sales grew organically in the high teens or better all year long. In the fourth quarter, as for the full year, this growth was broad-based with growth across all of our subregions, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East and North Africa. The growth was also strong across all of our category groups, cereal, snacks and noodles and other. Despite enormous cost pressures, the region also delivered double-digit profit growth on a currency-neutral adjusted basis both in the fourth quarter and the full year.\nSnacks in AMEA posted outstanding organic net sales growth all year, as shown on Slide #36. This growth was led by emerging markets ranging from Asia to Africa to the Middle East. And it was led by Pringles, which sustained strong consumption and share growth across key markets, both in the quarter and for the full year.\nIn Australia, we also realized good consumption growth in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats, both for the quarter and the full year. This bodes well for further international expansion of those brands.\nCereal also posted strong organic net sales growth all year, as shown on Slide #37. As with snacks, the growth was led by price/mix, with elasticity impact on volume being lower than usual. And we saw growth across all subregions, both in the fourth quarter and the full year. Growth was most pronounced in Africa and the Middle East, but it also remained solid in Asia and Australia.\nOverall, for the measured markets of this region, we grew consumption and share in the fourth quarter and the full year. Our most developed market, Australia, posted strong consumption growth in the quarter and year, led by many of our biggest brands, including double-digit gains for Corn Pops, Corn Flakes and Sultana Bran. We also sustained good consumption growth in emerging markets with particular strength in India.\nAnd then we come to the largest segment of AMEA, noodles and other, which is shown on Slide #38. In every quarter this year, our AMEA noodles and other business recorded organic net sales growth of well over 20%. In fact, it has delivered double-digit organic growth every year since we consolidated the distributor portion of our West African business in 2018.\nTurning to Slide #39. We expect another year of strong top and bottom line growth for AMEA in 2023. Macro conditions can be challenging in Africa, and we have an experienced management team and joint venture partner to execute through them, which should enable us to sustain momentum in noodles and other. We should continue to see growth in cereal, led by our markets in Asia. And we believe there is plenty of runway for Pringles to continue its strong growth. Meanwhile, AMEA will be looking to improve its profit margins as well.\nSo with that, allow me to briefly summarize with Slide #41. From our results and our outlook, it should be very clear that our Deploy for Growth strategy has us focused on the right priorities and building the right capabilities, and that our portfolio has been shaped decidedly toward growth. And following our planned separation later this year, visibility into the strength and performance of this portfolio will be even clearer. In fact, the vast majority of our portfolio is enjoying very strong momentum right now, as shown on Slide #41, and this is expected to drive above-target growth in net sales and operating profit in 2023.\nI want to thank our talented and dedicated Kellogg employees for making sure that nothing, not unusual economic conditions, not declining financial markets and pension accounting, not the preparation of an historical spin-off, will distract us from continuing to deliver for our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, we'll open up the line for your questions."

Welcome to the Kellogg Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company.\n\nJohn P. Renwick\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Planning, Kellogg Company\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter results and an update regarding our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSlide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.\nThis is a particular note amidst the current operating environment, which includes unusually high input cost inflation, global supply disruptions and uncertain global macroeconomic conditions, all of whose direction, length and severity are so difficult to predict.\nA recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com.\nAs always, when referring to our outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are delighted to be able to report yet another quarter of momentum, progress, better-than-expected results and an improved full year outlook. Our organization once again exhibited grit and creativity in navigating and executing through a global operating environment that showed little to no signs of easing.\nWe continue to improve our service levels in spite of persistent bottlenecks and shortages of everything from materials and equipment, to trucks and containers. We also continue to mitigate the profit impact of exceptionally high cost inflation with good execution of productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions.\nAnd even in this unusual operating environment, we again saw the strength of our portfolio play out. We sustained our strong growth momentum in snacks around the world, and our emerging markets saw a strong growth in all key category groups. And in our North America cereal business, we continued to recover inventory and share more quickly than expected from enormous disruptions late last year.\nAt the same time, work continues on the planned separations, which we announced in June. A recent milestone was the announcement of our North America cereal company leadership team, and we continue to work on organizational design and carve-out financials.\nAnd through all of this, we delivered a financial performance for quarter 3 that exceeded our expectations and enables us to raise our guidance for the full year. In short, another good quarter, adding to a track record of dependable delivery and with plenty of reasons to be confident that this kind of delivery can continue.\nYou can tell our Deploy for Growth strategy is working from the quality of our results. Slide #6 shows one key metric, our net sales growth. As you know, our momentum is not new. Our third quarter showed acceleration of a trend that has been running above our long-term target for the past few years. And while this third quarter acceleration was led by price realization necessary to keep up with soaring costs, the elasticity impact on volume has been less than expected, and our world-class brands continue to perform especially well in market.\nWe are seeing this momentum across markets and category groups. We grew net sales organically in all 4 regions and in all 4 category groups within those regions, from snacks to cereal to frozen foods to noodles and other. So this momentum is broad-based and long running and another reason to believe in our strategy, portfolio and people.\nAs a key element of our Deploy for Growth strategy, our ESG strategy is also working. A few highlights from quarter 3 are shown on Slide #7.\nLet me now turn it over to Amit, who will explain our financial results and outlook in more detail.\n\nAmit Banati\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide #9 provides a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Our net sales in quarter 3 grew more than 13% year-on-year on an organic basis, coming in higher than expected and bringing year-to-date organic growth to 10%. Our adjusted basis operating profit grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis in quarter 3, overcoming the impact of high cost, bottlenecks and shortages, and increased investment. This, too, was better than expected, and it puts our year-to-date growth at a similar 4%.\nOur adjusted basis earnings per share declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis in quarter 3 due to the as-anticipated reduction in pension income related to remeasuring the pension assets and interest rates. Nevertheless, through the end of the third quarter, our EPS was up 3% on this currency-neutral adjusted basis.\nCash flow through the first 3 quarters remained well ahead of last year. Excluded from our currency-neutral results, of course, is foreign currency translation, which reduced our net sales, operating profit and earnings per share by 4 to 5 percentage points each as the dollar strengthened meaningfully further during the quarter.\nNow let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide #10 lays out the components of our strong net sales growth this year. Despite supply challenges and our suspension of Pringles shipments to Russia, volume only declined relatively modestly, suggesting that price elasticity has not moved up as much or as soon as we had expected. Price/mix accelerated again in quarter 3, and it accelerated in all 4 regions as they continue to utilize revenue growth management to help offset higher input costs. All 4 regions delivered double-digit increases in price/mix in quarter 3. Both of these components, volume and price/mix, were relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends.\nTurning now to gross profit. Slide #11 illustrates how each region is facing enormously high cost pressure. Year-to-date, our COGS per kilo inflation has run in the high teens or worst in each region, driven by both input cost inflation and costs and inefficiencies arising from global bottlenecks and shortages, not to mention adverse transactional foreign exchange. And keep in mind that this is net of the good work we are doing on productivity.\nOur net sales per kilo, which is how we measure price/mix, is up in the mid-teens, covering a sizable portion of our input cost inflation. However, it is not able to cover the unpredictable impact of supply disruptions and the first quarter impacts related to last year's second half fire and strike. Our net sales per kilo accelerated sequentially in quarter 3, in part reflecting revenue growth management actions taken during the quarter. However, our COGS per kilo accelerated, too, indicating that these pressures are not behind us.\nSlide #12 shows that our gross profit dollars increased year-on-year, both in quarter 3 and on a year-to-date basis. During quarter 3, our margin decline narrowed as we had indicated it would. And our net sales grew enough that gross profit dollars increased at a mid-single-digit rate year-on-year. So even though our margins have been pressured by the current environment, our gross profit dollars remain on an upward trajectory.\nAs we look to quarter 4, we expect both margins and dollars to increase year-on-year as we lap last year's fire and strike impact. However, based on the current economic conditions, we no longer anticipate bottlenecks and shortages to diminish in quarter 4. As a result, while we still expect gross profit margin to increase year-on-year in the quarter, it won't be as much as previously projected. And this will mean finishing the full year with a gross margin that is down a bit more than 100 basis points previously mentioned but still growing in dollars.\nMoving down the income statement on Slide #13. We see how our SG&A accelerated its year-on-year increase just as we said it would. As expected, advertising and promotion investment increased year-on-year as our U.S. cereal business resumes commercial activity now that it has caught up on inventory, and overhead increased year-on-year reflecting higher incentive compensation and a resumption of travel and meetings. As we enter quarter 4, we expect to see an even larger year-on-year increase in SG&A as North America cereal restores more of its commercial activity.\nSlide #14 shows that in spite of these extreme operating conditions, not to mention this year's meaningfully adverse currency translation, we remain on an upward trajectory on operating profit. Operating profit in the third quarter was up 4% year-on-year on a currency-neutral basis and flat after the adverse currency translation. Year-to-date, it was up both on a currency-neutral basis and after adverse foreign exchange. We expect to see that continue in quarter 4.\nSlide #15 shows our below-the-line items, which were again collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter. Interest expense was up modestly year-on-year in quarter 3 as lower debt balances were offset by higher interest rates. As we mentioned last quarter, rising interest rates will affect the roughly 20% of our debt that is floating, and this will become much more acute in quarter 4.\nAs expected, other income decreased significantly year-on-year due to the midyear remeasurement of 2 of our U.S. pension plans, which adjusts for currently lower asset values and higher interest rates. This will similarly affect other income in quarter 4. And as mentioned previously, depending on how financial markets finished this year, this will be an even more significant headwind in 2023 as we'll have a full year impact across all of our post-retirement plans. Of course, this is a noncash nonoperating item.\nOur effective tax rate in quarter 3 was relatively flat year-on-year after benefiting from country mix and discrete benefits. We now look for our full year effective tax rate to be somewhere above 21.5%.\nOur JV earnings and minority interests were collectively down against an unusually high year-earlier period following our midyear '21 consolidation of Africa joint ventures, but remained fairly consistent with more recent quarters. And average shares outstanding were relatively flat year-on-year as the impact of our share buybacks early in the year was offset by increased option exercises by employees. As a result, we now think average shares outstanding will be flattish for the full year.\nOur cash flow and balance sheet also remain in very good shape, as shown on Slide #16. Our absolute cash flow has remained on an upward trajectory right through quarter 3, and this cash flow has enabled us to reduce our net debt over the past few years, leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility, even as we have continued to increase our cash return to share owners in the form of an increased dividend and buybacks this year.\nLet's now turn to Slide #17 and discuss where we think we'll finish the year. As Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance today based on our strong quarter 3 delivery and good top line momentum going into quarter 4. We are raising our full year outlook for organic net sales growth to approximately 10%, a sizable increase from our previous guidance of 7% to 8%. This reflects our better-than-expected performance in quarter 3, and it implies continued double-digit growth in the fourth quarter led by price/mix and sustained momentum in our business, partially offset by rising price elasticity and Russia impact. This improved sales outlook is prompting us to raise our full year outlook for adjusted basis currency-neutral operating profit growth to approximately 6%, up from our previous guidance of 4% to 5%. This is despite sustained high-teens cost inflation and our revised assumption around bottlenecks and shortages, which we now expect to persist through the fourth quarter.\nWe are also raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis earnings per share growth to approximately 3% growth on a currency-neutral basis, up from our previous guidance of 2%. This reflects the higher operating profit outlook, partially offset by a worsened outlook for below-the-line items. This includes our remeasured pension income and higher interest expense due to the rise in rates only partially offset by an effective tax rate that comes down slightly because of Q3's favorability.\nWe deliberately stick to currency-neutral guidance because of the difficulty in predicting foreign exchange rates. But because of the dollar's meaningful strengthening lately and the number of investor questions we received regarding its impact, I will mention that if today's exchange rates were to hold, we would absorb a negative impact of 3% to 4% on a full year net sales operating profit and EPS growth and a higher negative impact in quarter 4.\nOur full year outlook for cash flow remains approximately $1.2 billion. Remember that this guidance incorporates incremental upfront cash outlays in 2022 related to the previously announced separation transactions.\nSo to summarize our financial position on Slide #18, we feel very good about how we are performing and our financial condition. Our business is showing strong underlying momentum. Our efforts around productivity and revenue growth management are helping to mitigate unusually high cost pressures. We are raising our outlook for the full year largely on the strength of what we've already delivered. And our cash flow and balance sheet are giving us good financial flexibility.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss our individual businesses.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Amit. I'll start with a review of each of our regions, beginning with Kellogg North America on Slide #20. This region had another good quarter, delivering notably strong net sales growth with organic growth in both volume and price/mix. Our sales growth was led by what is by far our largest business in North America, and that's snacks. This business had another quarter of strong organic volume growth and price realization. And its net sales growth acceleration was accompanied by a similar acceleration in consumption. We'll talk more about these brands in a moment.\nCereal in North America also recorded another quarter of accelerated net sales growth, reaching double digits year-on-year, roughly in line with its consumption growth. We'll talk more about this business' rapid recovery also in a minute.\nIn our Frozen businesses, where we've experienced pronounced supply constraints this year, we returned to organic net sales growth in the quarter. This was aided by newly installed waffle capacity.\nKellogg North America in the third quarter delivered sequentially better operating profit growth as well despite no letup in input cost inflation or bottlenecks and shortages and despite increased reinvestment. So overall, North America continues to perform well and is poised for a strong finish to a strong year.\nKellogg Europe's results are shown on Slide #21. Ever since the war broke out in Ukraine, we've known that Kellogg Europe would have 2 very different halves of the year. Because as we suspended Pringles shipments into Russia right away during the first quarter, it took some time to work through inventories.\nNow in the second half, we feel the brunt of this lost revenue and profit. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has contributed to a surge in energy costs and bottlenecks and shortages as well as devaluations in currencies against the U.S. dollar and a pinched consumer that is contributing to increasing elasticities at least on cereal. And yet, Kellogg Europe in the third quarter still managed to sustain top line growth and mitigate the profit pressure even as it lapped the year earlier quarter's enormous sales and profit growth.\nIn snacks, which represent almost half of Kellogg Europe's sales, the lost sales in Russia were more than offset by double-digit organic growth elsewhere. Pringles maintained its double-digit consumption growth momentum, and portable wholesome snacks are generating strong consumption growth on the strength of Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Squares and Barretta nut bars.\nCereal net sales also grew organically, reflecting revenue growth management and broad-based consumption growth even as price elasticity continued to move toward historical levels. The fourth quarter faces similar Russia and cost headwinds as quarter 3 as well as increased reinvestment, but the underlying momentum in the business will be sustained.\nLet's turn to Kellogg Latin America, as shown on Slide #22. Strong organic net sales growth was broad-based across the region, with double-digit growth in both snacks and cereal and driven by revenue growth management actions.\nIn snacks, which represent more than 1/3 of our annual net sales in Latin America, we continue to drive very strong consumption growth in key markets, including double-digit growth and share gains for Pringles in the key markets of Mexico and Brazil.\nIn cereal, the net sales and consumption growth was led by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Productivity and revenue growth management actions helped to mitigate the impact of high cost inflation, adverse transactional foreign exchange and supply disruptions, leading to solid growth in Latin America's operating profit. In the remaining quarter this year, Latin America should sustain sales and profit growth even as we expect price elasticities to rise gradually as we work to offset continued cost inflation and supply challenges.\nWe'll finish our regional review with Kellogg AMEA and Slide #23. In the third quarter, our AMEA region sustained its exceptional momentum, accelerating its organic net sales growth for a third consecutive quarter. From a category perspective, noodles and other is our biggest segment in AMEA, representing almost half of the region's sales and led by our West African distributor business, Multipro. In the third quarter, it sustained organic net sales growth of more than 20% just as it has all year.\nSnacks accelerated its organic net sales growth in the quarter led by Pringles, which sustained its broad-based momentum in consumption growth, with notable outperformance in emerging markets. Cereal also sustained good broad-based net sales growth with particular strength in the Middle East and India. Despite facing the high cost pressures in the region, a function of input costs, ocean freight costs and adverse transactional foreign exchange, AMEA still managed to grow its currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit in the double digits in the third quarter. We expect similar dynamics and momentum to play out in the fourth quarter, making this a very strong year for our AMEA region.\nNow let's dig into each of our category groups and brands in a little more detail, shaping our discussion in terms of the businesses that comprise the planned post-separation companies. A breakout of these businesses is shown on Slide #24. As you can see, the businesses that represent 80% of our portfolio's net sales today and that will comprise global snacking company after the separations have continued to show outstanding growth this year. In fact, this portfolio's net sales have grown organically at a double-digit rate so far this year.\nFor North America cereal company, you can see that our net sales are up organically in the low single digits this year. The only business where there has been softness is Plant Co., which has continued to experience supply disruption, as we'll discuss in a moment.\nLet's look at each of these businesses and their key brands. Slide #25 shows how our world-class snacks brands sustained their in-market momentum in the third quarter around the world. Pringles, with $2.5 billion in annual net sales globally, once again generated double-digit consumption growth in virtually every one of our major markets around the world.\nCheez-It, with over $1 billion of annual net sales, sustained its double-digit growth in quarter 3 both in Canada and the U.S., where our new Puff'd platform has been incremental to the franchise.\nPop-Tarts, closing in on $1 billion of annual net sales, continued to post good growth in the third quarter in its primary market, the U.S., while continuing to show why we believe it has so much promise internationally.\nRice Krispies Treats, with $0.5 billion of annual net sales, was supply constrained in the U.S. during the third quarter and still grew consumption in the mid-single digits, with its new Homestyle subline proving to be incremental to the franchise, and the brand is showing good growth in international markets as well. These are important brands. The 4 brands collectively represent more than 40% of the total net sales of what will be a global snacking company.\nSlide #26 provides a glimpse of our international cereal businesses. As you can see, good consumption growth continued in the third quarter with the growth led by world-class brands and by emerging markets. In more developed cereal markets like those in Europe, Australia, Japan and Korea, we are starting to see price elasticity move higher. Nevertheless, we grew consumption across key European markets in the third quarter with Special K back to growth aided by a new campaign and the launch of Special K Granola with 30% less sugar. We also grew consumption in Australia, and our consumption is beginning to improve in Japan and Korea on the relaunch and expansion of granola offerings. In emerging markets, which represent about half of our international cereal sales annually, consumption growth remains robust both for us and the category. On the slide, note the solid consumption growth rates in key Latin America markets and in India.\nSlide #27 shows the sustained double-digit organic net sales growth of our noodles and other category group. This is a $1 billion-plus business annually comprised of our distributor business in West Africa and our Kellogg's branded noodles business elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. And as we've already discussed, this business again sustained exceptional growth in the third quarter, adding to a track record of consistent double-digit or high single-digit growth. As we've said before, this reflects the competitive advantage Multipro offers as well as the value of offering a Kellogg's product line at the lower end of the price pyramid.\nNow let's look at frozen breakfast and Slide #28. Eggo is another world-class brand in our portfolio with about $750 million in annual net sales globally. In the U.S., the brand has sustained steady consumption growth this year despite being very constrained on capacity for both waffles and pancakes. But while we remain constrained on pancakes, we did add internal waffle capacity during the second quarter. This enabled our waffles to accelerate consumption gradually during the third quarter, even returning to volume growth. And this has lifted the brand's overall consumption growth sequentially, as shown on the slide. And another driver of this growth has been the launch of Liège-style waffles, an on-the-go offering that is proving to be incremental to the franchise.\nNow let's look at North America cereal. Slide #29 shows how our consumption and share are recovering in the U.S. following our unfortunate fire and labor strike in late 2021. Recall that we rebuilt inventory, both our own and that of our retailers, faster than anticipated during the first half. In quarter 3, we have seen our share continue to recover across key brands, and this has continued into October. This reflects not only increased on-shelf availability, but also our gradual resumption of commercial activity behind these brands.\nThe good news is that the category is showing robust growth right now, accelerating to the double digits in quarter 3 on the strength of increased prices and below-average elasticity. The even better news is that our consumption growth has accelerated even faster than the category, as you can see in the chart on the left. And our share is already back to its pre-strike level, as you can see on the chart on the right. Clearly, we are building momentum as we return to commercial activity. And while this chart focuses on our recovery in the U.S., it has been just as impressive in Canada, where we returned to share gains in the third quarter. And in both markets, we have a strong lineup of commercial activity continuing in the fourth quarter.\nJust a few of these are shown on Slide #30, ranging from innovation like Strawberry Frosted Flakes, to seasonal offerings like Halloween Rice Krispies and the perennial favorite, Elf on the Shelf, to bringing back indulgent licensed foods like Cinnabon and Little Debbie. We have our Mission Tiger program back in full swing, and we're experimenting with an innovative just-add-water product called Insta-bowls.\nIn short, we feel good about where we are in this business. We've restored inventory levels. We're back on shelf, and we are rapidly recovering share. In addition, we've turned back on our commercial programs. And equally importantly, we are making good early progress toward restoring profit margins in this business.\nWe'll now turn to plant-based foods and Slide #31. For context, this business represents only about 2% of our total net sales, but it gets a lot of attention because of its promising long-term prospects and because of the recent slowdown of its category. This is a category that experienced the equivalent of a few years' worth of acceleration in a single year, 2020. It had already been in elevated growth with new entrants, new technologies and new space in stores. Then COVID hit, and product proliferation was soaked up by the surge in at-home demand, bringing penetration and buy rates up with it.\nThe category lapped that surge in 2021. And in 2022, it has experienced a pause in growth, and points of distribution have decreased in stores as many retailers consolidated into the frozen aisle. But household penetration remains above pre-COVID levels, with ample opportunities to return to consistent growth behind underlying consumer focus on health and environmental concerns. These are demand fundamentals that remain firmly in place for a long runway of growth.\nAs you know, our Morningstar Farms brand has been severely impacted by supply disruptions at a key co-manufacturer this year. And this disruption has not yet been fully resolved in quarter 3 and has also forced us to prioritize SKUs. While we have not yet been able to fully resume commercial activity, we have been able to support products that are not capacity constrained. A good example is sausage and links, and we are generating double-digit consumption and good share growth in that segment. This supply disruption is a temporary issue, and we continue to work through it. The brand remains a leader in plant-based foods with strong plans and a new media campaign once it restores full supply. So despite near-term disruptions, this is a business that remains in good condition with excellent prospects.\nSo with that, allow me to briefly summarize with Slide #33. I could not be prouder of our organization for how it has navigated through an incredibly volatile environment, identifying issues, resolving them and executing. Our people and culture truly are a competitive advantage for Kellogg. Our strategy is working, and our portfolio is showing its strength.\nWe continue to deliver solid results, and we are again raising our outlook. Yet we're anything but complacent. We are working hard on a set of plans that will navigate through the current macro headwinds and enable us to drive balanced financial delivery again in 2023 and thereafter.\nAnd with that, we'll open up the line for questions.

Welcome to the Kinross Second Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the conference over to Chris Lichtenheldt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Lichtenheldt\n\nVP of IR, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, President and CEO; and from the Kinross senior leadership team, Andrea Freeborough, Paul Tomory and Geoff Gold.\nFor a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 2 of this presentation, our news release dated July 27, 2022, the MD&A for the period ended June 30, 2022, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'm going to briefly review our second quarter performance. comment on our expectations for the second half of 2022 and update you on key developments across our portfolio. Then I will provide some comments on the state of our business and the compelling value opportunity our shares currently offer. After that, I will turn the call over to Andrea and Paul, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and on our operations. .\nBeginning with our results. As a company that has met guidance 9 out of the last 10 years, I am not happy with our operational results in the first half of this year. Given the challenges we have encountered, we are now targeting production at the low end of our guidance range.\nIn order to meet the low end of guidance, we will need to produce nearly 400,000 ounces more in the second half than we did in the first. We see the increase in production coming from the following 4 areas: one, the movement to higher grades at Paracatu; two, seasonally enhanced recovery from our U.S. heap leach operations with particularly strong performance expected from Bald Mountain; three, maintaining the 21,000 tonne per day throughput at Tasiast that we have already achieved; and four, working through supply chain challenges at the La Coipa mill. I want to give you my commitment that we will be highly focused on the delivery of these objectives.\nOn costs, with the slower ramp-up at La Coipa, resulting in lower production overall, combined with inflation, we expect to be above our guidance for cost of sales in ASIC. Andrea will elaborate on this in a few moments. We remain confident in our expectation our cost per ounce will drop in the second half relative to the first half, given the planned increases in grade and production across our portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, we improved our liquidity by paying down $120 million of debt, and we plan to repay an additional $300 million to $400 million in the second half. We also continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividend program and plan to continue our buyback program in the second half.\nMoving to our projects. Things are progressing well. And of particular note, yesterday evening, we released the study results for our 70% owned high-grade Manh Choh project. We are pleased with the results of the study, and we'll be moving forward.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the sale of our Russian business for total cash consideration of $340 million with $300 million received on closing. We continue to advance towards the closing of Chirano, which we expect will be finalized in August. These divestitures have resulted in approximately 70% of our production now coming from the Americas.\nLooking at our value proposition. We have a competitive reserve life index into the next decade, substantial production focused in the Americas, significant margin and free cash flow, a strong balance sheet and an attractive return of capital. Our top 2 assets, Tasiast and Paracatu, together are expected to produce, on average, more than 1 million ounces annually into the next decade.\nThe rest of our portfolio in Alaska, Nevada and Chile make up an additional 1 million ounces, which we expect to produce annually. In addition, we expect our world-class Great Bear development project to carry our production into future decades.\nBefore I turn the call over, I want to touch on the important area of safety, our first priority. Sadly in July, we suffered a fatality at our Tasiast mine. This unfortunate incident is a reminder that despite our constant focus on safety, our work is never done, and we need to be continuously improving our standards and practices. We value the health and safety of our workforce above all else and are taking steps to continuously improve our risk management and safety systems to safeguard every member of our team.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrea for a review of our financial results.\n\nAndrea Susan Freeborough\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. I'll cover financial highlights from the quarter, provide an overview of our balance sheet, and then touch on our capital allocation.\nFirst, I'd like to point out that all the financial metrics I'll comment on today exclude our former Russian assets and Chirano. As Paul noted, our second quarter production of 454,000 ounces was stronger than the first quarter, driven primarily by increases at Paracatu and our U.S. operations. Our Q2 cost of sales was $1,027 per ounce, which increased relative to the first quarter, largely due to increased cost at Round Mountain and higher fuel costs at Tasiast. We expect cost of sales to decrease in the second quarter, which I'll come back to.\nAll-in sustaining costs of $1,341 per ounce were higher than Q1 due to the increase in cost of sales and higher sustaining capital. As we indicated in our press release yesterday, our costs are tracking above our previous guidance range, and we're now expecting full year cost of sales to be approximately $900 per ounce and our all-in sustaining cost to be approximately $1,240 per ounce due mainly to lower production from La Coipa and inflation.\nOn inflation, we previously incorporated a 7% increase in our operating costs for the year. We now expect the impact to be around 10% to 12% for the full year, and we factored that into our revised guidance. For CapEx, our initial assumption of 10% to 15% inflation still holds.\nOur expectation of $900 per ounce incorporates lower cost of sales in the second half at approximately $830 per ounce. We're confident in this reduction, which comes from the ramp-up in production across the portfolio and the benefit from increased lower cost ounces at Tasiast and La Coipa in particular.\nOur second quarter adjusted operating cash flow was relatively consistent with Q1 at $252 million. CapEx of $150 million in Q2 was higher than Q1, but still at lower pace than what's planned for the second half. We still expect to spend our guided CapEx range of the $850 million by year-end.\nFree cash flow during the quarter was $108 million or $103 million, excluding working capital changes, which was a significant increase over Q1. We expect free cash flow to increase further in the second half particularly in Q4 as our production increases and costs decrease, subject to future gold prices.\nWith regards to our balance sheet, our financial position remains strong and is expected to strengthen further, both in the second half of the year and going forward into 2023 and 2024.\nWe maintained investment-grade credit ratings from our 3 rating agencies, 2 of which reaffirmed ratings during the second quarter. We ended the quarter with a solid cash and liquidity position with $719 million of cash and approximately $2.1 billion of total liquidity. As Paul mentioned, we repaid $120 million of debt in the second quarter with another $100 million paid down in July and plans for continued repayments going forward. Our trailing 12-month net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved slightly at June 30 to 1.7x. We expect this ratio to continue to come down throughout this year and next year.\nFinally, on capital allocation, as Paul noted, we expect to continue with our dividend, which we planned for the long term, including at lower gold prices. Our dividend now amounts to a compelling yield of nearly 4%. We also plan to maintain our baseline share buyback program at the same level as our dividend. But as always, we're monitoring gold prices and inflation as we think about our capital allocation priorities.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Botond Stilicho Tomory\n\nExecutive VP & CTO, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrea. This morning, I'll provide key updates on our operations, share highlights from our decision to proceed with Manh Choh as well as details on our ongoing growth projects and share some news from exploration.\nAcross our portfolio, Q2 improved compared with Q1, but was not without challenges, as Paul mentioned. Looking forward, we remain on track to ramp production up in the second half of the year, driven by planned higher grades and throughput levels across the portfolio.\nI'll provide a few examples of this, starting with Tasiast. Tasiast delivered a good second quarter with 129,000 ounces produced. Head grades remained strong in Q2, and we're encouraged by the ongoing throughput ramp-up regularly achieving more than 21,000 tonnes per day. The outlook on Tasiast remains strong, and the site remains on track for a record year with over 600,000 ounces of production. We're expecting a production increase of at least 30% from Tasiast in the second half of the year largely driven by sustained throughput of 21,000 tonnes a day and increasing grades coming out of West Branch 4, where we are mining now.\nIn July, for example, the mill grade average just below 3 grams per tonne. The second phase of the project ramp up to 24,000 tonnes a day also remains on track for completion in the middle of 2023, with engineering substantially complete and procurement well underway. Construction of the solar power plant at Tasiast is advancing with detailed engineering ongoing and procurement underway with initial site activities expected to start later this year.\nAt Paracatu, production for the quarter was 129,000 ounces, up roughly 20% compared with the first quarter. We expect to see higher grades of Paracatu through the remainder of the year as mining enters into a higher grade ore in the Southwest area of the pit as planned. The processing of lower grade stockpiles is largely complete for this year. Throughout July, we have been averaging a grade of 0.45 grams a tonne which is approximately 30% higher than the first half, and we expect to produce around 50,000 ounces this month alone.\nI'll then move over to La Coipa. As Paul mentioned, commissioning the mill progressed more slowly than initially planned in the second quarter. However, La Coipa is making progress and will be a meaningful contributor to our portfolio going forward in terms of production and cash flow. The temporary delays were primarily driven by issues commissioning the pumps and some of the other components in the mill, exacerbated by global supply chain problems, which have hindered the availability of critical components. Mitigations are ongoing and July is showing improving throughput levels, including recently reaching 10,000 tonnes per day.\nWith the commissioning of the second line of the plant underway, we now expect La Coipa to reach sustained throughput of 13,000 tonnes per day in the fourth quarter. These issues have resulted in a production deferral of approximately 60,000 ounces. To reflect this delay as well as a higher gold to silver price ratio than initially assumed in our guidance, we have revised our expected La Coipa production for the year down from 200,000 ounces to 125,000 gold equivalent ounces.\nWe do not expect the delay to impact production going forward once we're ramped up, so production in 2023 and beyond is intact, and the ounces deferred this year will be realized in future quarters. Mining rates have also ramped up as planned, and we now have a stockpile of 800,000 tonnes, the grade of 1.2 grams per tonne gold equivalent ready for the mill.\nMoving to Round Mountain. The site optimization project remains on track for completion later this year. Overall, there are no significant changes to our expectations from our most recent comments. We expect to develop Round Mountain according to the following sequence: Phases W-1 and W-2, 2 subphases of Phase W will be mined as an open pit and are the priority for the next 2 to 3 years. Then Phase S will be added starting Q1 of 2023 and the necessary permits for this phase were received this past month in June. Following that, we expect to mine W-3 and W-4, which are the last 2 sub phases of W. We continue to evaluate the trade-off between underground versus open pit for these phases.\nLooking longer term, we're advancing the study of underground options for both Phase X and Gold Hill, both of which are showing promise. We'll provide more details later this year as we approach the completion of our optimization study. To recap, our confidence in the strong second half relates to improved grades as per our plan mine sequence of Paracatu, and Tasiast production growth coming from a combination of sustained throughput at 21,000 tonnes a day and higher grade ore from West Branch 4. And at La Coipa, where we are progressively advancing the commissioning of the second line of the plant. And lastly, leaching at the U.S. sites is picking up as expected.\nI will move to an update now on the Manh Choh project. We are pleased to announce that we're proceeding with the execution of the Manh Choh project in Alaska. Manh Choh provides a robust growth project for Kinross, adding high-grade, low-cost production to Fort Knox. The project returns remain attractive despite the impact of inflation. Our preproduction capital investment of $190 million includes a higher than typical contingency to allow for the possibility of future inflation. The acquisition of permits is also progressing well. Earthworks and road construction will be the priority for the remainder of 2022, setting us up for a successful field season in 2023. And we expect to be in production during the second half of 2024.\nBefore turning the call back over to Paul, I'll provide a brief update on our exploration programs. Starting with Great Bear, as our exploration program advances, the results reaffirm our expectation that this will become a world-class mine. We remain on track to complete the 200-kilometer exploration drill program for the year. We continue to receive positive drill and assay results that confirmed gold mineralization, which is open along strike and depth. And we received exciting results at depths below 500 meters. Of note, our recent drill hole from earlier this month intercepted 18 meters, a 5.8 gram per tonne gold, including 2 meters of 41.8 grams per tonne at a vertical depth of approximately 550 meters. Results like these support our vision for a sizable underground mine to complement the open pit.\nAlso, the 35,000 meter grade control program has been completed, confirming our initial view on the high-grade core of the LP Fault Zone. This program has improved our understanding of continuity and great distribution. On this topic, I want to clarify a point we made during our June 28 project update session that may have been misunderstood. The high-grade nature of the open pit that we originally envisioned has been confirmed. In addition to this, we've discovered low-grade material that is incremental and will be stockpiled to ensure we maintain high-grade mill feed. So this is good news and expect it to add value.\nEnvironmental baseline studies have begun and all key work packages have been awarded for scoping level engineering work. All in all, we remain very encouraged by the results of our work to date and look forward to disclosing our initial resource with our year-end results.\nOther exploration highlights in the portfolio include encouraging drill results at our Curlew Basin project and extensions to the Round Mountain Gold Hill being identified in the late part of 2021. At Curlew, drilling from underground has improved the understanding of mineralized vein orientations. In addition to encouraging results from the Stealth and Galaxy veins, initial drive results from the lower portal zone show excellent potential to contribute to overall resource growth. We remain on track to report an expected mineral inventory of 1 million ounces for year-end results.\nAt Round Mountain Gold Hill, drilling has extended the main in [Alexander veins] or 300 meters along strike and 200 meters down depth. New geophysical data confirms multiple deposit scale trends open along strike at Gold Hill. We are encouraged by the significant strike continuity and the open untested nature of the trend. Meanwhile, Phase X, plans for the construction of an underground exploration drift continue to advance well and remain on track to commence in the fourth quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Paul.\n\nJ. Paul Rollinson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul. Despite operating challenges in the first half, our operations continue to advance towards our plans, and we are confident in our outlook for a strong second half. Our company continues to generate meaningful free cash flow, and we think the value our shares offer has never been better.\nWe have an improved geopolitical footprint, a robust production pipeline with exciting projects and exploration to come, a significant free cash flow profile, a strong balance sheet, and an attractive return of capital program.\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions."

Welcome to the Kellogg Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your call.\n\nJohn P. Renwick\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Planning, Kellogg Company\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSlide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.\nThis is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic and supply disruptions when the length and severity of these issues and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict.\nA recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be able to report another good quarter, delivering solid results even ahead of plan by sustaining growth momentum across our international businesses and our North America snacks brands, realizing price and productivity amidst decades high inflation and executing with agility. After all, we are navigating through what I think you would all agree continues to be an extremely challenging operating environment. The situation in Ukraine only accelerated cost inflation and exacerbated the global economy's bottlenecks and shortages. It also prompted us to suspend all shipments and investments into Russia and to identify new sources for certain ingredients.\nMeanwhile, the team has done an excellent job of quickly restoring and ramping up production in our U.S. cereal plants following the fire and strike of last year's second half. Our inventory is gradually building toward normal levels as planned, enabling us to start replenishing retailer inventories earlier than expected in the first quarter. To be able to affirm our full year earnings guidance is a testament to our strategy, our brands and our people.\nOur Deploy for Growth strategy shown on Slide #5 is working. This strategy is still as appropriate and effective as ever, even as occasions shift and the operating environment evolves. We continue to emphasize occasions and build on our world-class brands. We continue to see the benefits of our reshaped portfolio. And through extreme supply challenges, we continue to focus on service and in-store effectiveness.\nBehind all these growth boosters are capabilities that we have strengthened from data and analytics to e-commerce, to revenue growth management, to a robust innovation pipeline. You're seeing the benefits of these capabilities and our actions and results. Simply put, the strategy is working.\nWe remain equally focused on Better Days, our ESG strategy. Actions are louder than words. Slide #6 offers some examples of our ESG activities during the first quarter. They reflect continued action on various elements of ESG as we remain committed as ever to our values and doing what is right for the planet and for our communities.\nSticking to our strategy and focusing on execution is resulting in sustained top line momentum, as you can see on Slide #7. We had restored top line growth in 2019, experienced a pandemic-related acceleration in 2020 and yet sustained this strong growth in 2021 despite what we were lapping. And in quarter 1 of this year, even with difficult comparisons, we continue to exceed our long-term target of 1% to 3% net sales growth with organic growth of more than 4%.\nI'll call out 2 key elements that are behind this momentum. The first is our reshaped portfolio. Our largest portfolio segment, the Developed Market Snacks, continued to generate strong growth led by world-class brands like Pringles, Cheez-It and others. And our emerging markets collectively sustained double-digit growth. So even in a quarter when one of our businesses, North America cereal, was notably soft, declining 10% year-on-year because of a lack of inventory, this was more than offset by momentum in the rest of our portfolio.\nAnd the second element is price realization. In an environment in which cost inflation is too high to cover with productivity alone, we have leveraged our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities to realize price effectively. We've been realizing price ever since cost inflation began to accelerate back in the second half of 2020, and we have accelerated as the market-driven cost inflation worsened.\nThe result of all of this strategy, executional focus and sustained momentum is another quarter of delivering results and a firm full year outlook and increased cash to shareowners, as discussed on Slide #8. We grew our net sales faster than we had anticipated, and we delivered more operating profit than we had projected. Our earnings per share and cash flow also came in ahead of our plan. This puts us in a good position. It allows us to affirm earnings guidance for the full year as an improved net sales outlook covers the impacts of accelerated cost inflation and supply disruptions, including Russia and Ukraine. It also enables us to increase the cash return to shareowners, which we have done both in the form of accelerated share buybacks and an increased dividend.\nSo with that introduction, let me now turn it over to Amit, who will explain our results and outlook in more detail.\n\nAmit Banati\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve said, we're off to a good start to 2022. We'll start with a brief summary of our quarter 1 financial results on Slide #10. Our net sales growth came on top of similarly good growth in the year earlier quarter and is tracking ahead of our previous full year guidance. As expected, operating profit declined against last year's double-digit gain, but it should be noted that the year-on-year decline was entirely related to the wraparound impact of the fire and strike we experienced in 2021.\nEarnings per share also exceeded our expectations, reflecting the better operating profit and with unfavorability in other income, offset by some discrete favorable items in our tax rate. Cash flow came in ahead of plan and significantly higher than last year.\nSlide #11 lays out the components of our net sales growth in quarter 1. Volume was down year-on-year due to lapping a strong 2-year CAGR of nearly 4% but also due to lacking inventory in certain businesses going into this year, most notably in our North America cereal business. In fact, North America cereal volume decline represented almost half of our total company's year-on-year volume decline in the quarter. We also surprised elasticity resuming in many markets just as we have been forecasting, although still running well below historical levels.\nPrice/mix grew nearly 10% year-on-year, an acceleration from recent quarters as we continue to work to offset market-driven cost inflation. This price realization is predominantly price as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions in all 4 regions with a much smaller contribution coming from a mix shift towards snacks. The result was organic basis net sales growth of over 4% year-on-year, another strong quarterly performance that continues to exceed our long-term target. This was better than forecast, principally because of less price elasticity than expected but also because of sooner-than-anticipated replenishment of trade inventories in North America cereal, at least some of which could be considered timing-related. Foreign currency translation clipped nearly 2 percentage points of net sales growth in the quarter, with the U.S. dollar strengthening year-on-year against virtually all of our major currencies.\nSlide #12 shows our gross profit in dollars. As anticipated, our gross profit declined year-on-year, principally because of supply disruption. The good news is that productivity and revenue growth management continued to mostly cover the market-driven cost inflation despite the latter accelerating again in the quarter. This is what we can manage, and we've done a good job of it.\nThe single largest driver of our gross profit decline was a transitory impact of the fire and strike we experienced in the second half of last year. This impact reflects not only lost sales year-on-year, but significant costs as well. On top of this are the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages that are expected to persist at least through the first half. These 2 factors accounted for almost all of our year-on-year decline in gross profit dollars in quarter 1 and about half of the margin contraction. These are transitory factors and should diminish as the year progresses.\nThe rest of the margin contraction was related to mix. As we've discussed, our only meaningful mix headwind is the shift towards emerging markets, and particularly toward our AMEA region and its Nigerian distributor business, Multipro. In quarter 1, this mix shift towards AMEA was especially pronounced. As we've often stated, this mix shift does not bother us because our growth in emerging markets and in Multipro are not cannibalizing any of our higher-margin developed markets businesses, which brings us to operating profit on Slide #13.\nDespite transitory supply disruptions, our operating profit remains on an upward trajectory, owing primarily to higher net sales. With our supply constraints in many of our businesses, most notably in North America cereal, our advertising and promotion investment was much lower than usual in quarter 1. As we discussed last quarter, this A&P investment is expected to be restored gradually across the year in line with our recovering supply. The result of our lower gross profit was a year-on-year decline in operating profit, which was also up against a double-digit growth comparison. Importantly, though, our quarter 1 operating profit was still higher than that of quarter 1 2020 and even quarter 1 2019, sustaining an upward trajectory.\nTurning now to our below-the-line items on Slide 14. Lower debt year-on-year translated into lower interest expense, though the run-up in rates during quarter 1 will likely create year-on-year increases in the coming quarters. Other income was negatively affected by lower pension income as expected but also by the impact of a declining bond market on our company-owned life insurance investments. Lower net pension income will continue through the year.\nOur effective tax rate benefited from a couple of relatively small discrete items in quarter 1. Our JV earnings and minority interest collectively improved year-on-year, reflecting the consolidation of certain Africa JVs at midyear last year. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, mainly reflecting the repurchases we made in 2021. We were active on buybacks during the quarter, and this will have an impact on average shares outstanding in quarter 2.\nLet's look at our cash flow and balance sheet on Slide #15. Cash flow came in strongly in quarter 1 on the strength of higher net earnings, continued management of core working capital and some timing of accruals and capital investment. As you can see on the chart, we start the year well ahead of where we typically are in quarter 1 aside from the unusual pandemic year of 2020. In addition, our net debt remains lower year-on-year. Between strong cash flow and a deleveraged balance sheet, we feel good about our financial flexibility. This financial flexibility has given us the ability to increase the cash we return to shareowners. We recently announced another increase in our [dividend]. And in quarter 1, we repurchased some $300 million of our stock.\nLet's now turn to the rest of the year. Our primary planning assumptions are shown on Slide 16. We expect to deliver sustained momentum on the top line, led by our strong snacking portfolio around the world and geographically by our emerging markets. Price/mix would continue to drive our net sales growth as we try to keep up with rising costs and as we continue to assume some combination of decelerating at-home demand growth and resumed price elasticity.\nOur market-driven cost inflation has gotten higher, worsened by the war in Ukraine, and it looks like it will persist longer than originally anticipated. This has been incorporated into our outlook. From a supply disruption standpoint, we are largely past the fire and strike impact, though we will still expect bottlenecks and shortages to persist at least through the first half, with disruption related to the war in Ukraine more weighted to the second half. Meanwhile, as we mentioned, we do plan to gradually restore overhead and brand building investment across our regions as the year progresses, be it behind capabilities or resumed commercial activity behind supply-constrained brands.\nSlide #17 shows how these planning assumptions translate into updated full year guidance. We are raising our forecast for organic basis net sales growth to about 4% growth versus our previous estimate of about 3%. This reflects the momentum in our business and the fact that price/mix is likely to come in higher than we previously planned as we seek to cover incremental cost inflation. This higher net sales should offset the incremental pressures of accelerated cost inflation and supply disruption. As a result, we continue to focus currency-neutral adjusted basis growth of 1% to 2% in operating profit. We also continue to forecast currency-neutral adjusted basis growth of 1% to 2% in earnings per share, with a further reduction in other income, partially offset by the full year flow-through of quarter 1 discrete tax benefits.\nFrom a phasing standpoint, the only new news since last quarter is that we got off to a better-than-expected start in quarter 1, but that our second half will now experience more cost inflation and disruption and costs related to supply.\nFinally, we continue to forecast cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This is roughly in line with our reported basis net income growth with no changes to our disciplined approach to restructuring outlays, core working capital and capital expenditure.\nSo in summary, we got off to a good start in quarter 1, delivering solid financial results in the face of massive headwinds and even putting us ahead of plan. Our brands continue to perform well, and we have been effective at offsetting market-driven cost inflation with productivity and revenue growth management. Our cash flow generation remains strong, and our balance sheet remains strong. So we feel good about our financial position and the outlook.\nLet me now turn it back to Steve for a review of our regions.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Amit. The first thing you'll note about our quarter 1 is the continuation of broad-based top line growth. Slide #20 shows our organic net sales growth by region in the first quarter, along with the 2-year CAGR that they had to lap.\nWe generated organic basis net sales growth of 8% in Europe, 6% in Latin America and 17% in AMEA. These are exceptional growth rates. And in North America, where last year's fire and strike left us with low cereal inventory, and therefore, lost sales, our reported and organic net sales were still only down less than 1%. In fact, if you exclude cereal, the rest of our North America business grew by 3% to 4% year-on-year, even against tough comparisons. In a moment, we'll walk you through the key category groups within each region.\nYou'll see the continued exceptional growth of a relatively new growth leg for us, and that's noodles in Africa. You'll see that cereal and frozen foods, the category groups that are the most at home in nature, have therefore seen the most deceleration as consumer mobility has increased. But outside of North America, with its supply disruption from the fire and strike, we do continue to grow in cereal internationally. But you'll also see that in all 4 regions, our biggest category group, snacks, continue to grow strongly even against tough 2-year comparisons.\nSlide #21 offers the world-class snacks brands we've been talking to you about, and they had another quarter of excellent consumption growth. Pringles continues to gain penetration and distribution in key markets around the world and continued its strong consumption and net sales growth in the first quarter. Cheez-It, already a powerhouse in the U.S., is growing rapidly in Canada and is off to a strong start in its launch in Brazil. Pop-Tarts continues to grow in the U.S., but look at its growth rates in markets like the U.K. and Mexico as well. Rice Krispies Treats is enjoying explosive growth in several markets outside of the U.S. as we put more focus and support behind that unique brand.\nNot only are these brands continuing to grow in North America, but this chart can give you a glimpse of their international potential. Aside from Pringles, these brands are in very early days of expansion, which is part of our strategy. And their growth rates speak to their long-term potential.\nLet's now review each region in turn, starting with North America on Slide #22. North America's net sales declined slightly on an organic basis, owing to the fire and strike-related impact on cereal. Supply constraints, most notably low inventory heading into the quarter for cereal, did pressure volume. But as we'll see in a moment, we did sustain good momentum elsewhere in the portfolio, especially in snacks.\nPrice/mix grew more than 7% year-on-year as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions. Operating profit declined year-on-year, not only because of lapping a mid-single-digit 2-year CAGR, but also because of the bottlenecks and shortages that persist in the economy and the wraparound impact from the fire and strike we experienced in the second half of 2021.\nOur snacks business in North America posted organic net sales growth of 5% in the quarter. As you can see on Slide #23, this sales growth lagged consumption, which remained quite strong. Pringles generated consumption growth of more than 8% year-on-year, lapping last year's double-digit gain. This brand is in very good shape.\nWe saw strong growth in our core 4 flavors in standard cans propelled by effective brand building, including our Super Bowl execution. And we saw continued rapid growth in multipacks. And in a sign of resuming consumer mobility, we are seeing a rebound in immediate consumption offerings as well.\nCheez-It also sustained its strong momentum, growing consumption in the double digits, with the new Puff'd platform proving to be incremental to both the Snap'd platform and the core cracker line. But we didn't just gain share in crackers because of Cheez-It. We also outpaced the category with the Club and Town House brands. Pop-Tarts grew consumption in the double digits, and so did Rice Krispies Treats, with both brands sustaining excellent momentum through the strength of effective marketing programs and incremental innovation. And while we're at, Nutri-Grain also grew consumption in the double digits, and RX continues to reaccelerate its growth as consumers go back on the move. So our North America snacks business remains very strong.\nLet's turn now to North America cereal in Slide #24. Recall that 2022 is all about recovering from last year's fire and strike. As you know, we entered the quarter with very low finished goods inventory, which obviously hampered our net sales and consumption year-on-year. The good news is that our first order of business in quarter 1 was restoring production in the 4 affected plants, which our team achieved and ahead of schedule. With demand holding up well and retailers anxious to restore their inventories, we were able to ship out more product in the first quarter than we had anticipated. This certainly will help us improve consumption going forward.\nSlide #25 offers a good way to gauge our progress on restoring supply. It measures our share against our total distribution points. You can see the sharp decline in last year's fourth quarter as retailers ran through their inventory, and we were unable to replenish it. As we ramped up production during the first quarter, you can see product returning to the shelves in the form of recovering TDPs, and therefore, share. This reflects our improving supply and is a testament to the strength of our brands and relationships with our retail partners. This sequential improvement is what we expect to continue to realize as we get through the first half. In fact, this positive trend has continued quite clearly in April. This will put us right on track to gradually restore commercial plans brand-by-brand towards full recovery in the second half.\nOur Frozen businesses in North America are depicted on Slide #26. Eggo consumption growth remained strong, with mid-single-digit growth on top of a mid-single-digit 2-year CAGR. This is good performance given that we've been capacity constrained, especially on pancakes. The even better news is that we have incremental Eggo capacity coming online in the second quarter.\nIn our plant-based business, MorningStar Farms consumption was down against the mid-teens 2-year CAGR comparison, and the category has paused on distribution gains and household penetration gains after surging the past couple of years. We've seen some share loss as competitors have entered and expanded offerings in our segments and, in many cases, competing intensely on price.\nSo in total, North America got off to a good start in the first quarter with progress on supply recovery in cereal and in-market momentum elsewhere in the portfolio.\nClosing out North America, Slide #27 highlights some of the exciting innovations and commercial programs we have going into the marketplace. To remind you that even though we're in an unusual supply environment, we continue to delight consumers.\nOn the innovation front, Cheez-It Puff'd is off to an even faster start than Snap'd, the platform we launched a couple of years ago. Club Crisps is also new to the market, providing a light and fresh snack that's built on the strength of our Club crackers line. For Pop-Tarts, we've launched new flavors like Snickerdoodle, expanded on a simple ingredient line called Pop-Tarts Simply and brought back a fan favorite Frosted Grape.\nAnd in Frozen, beyond the lookout for Eggo's new Liège-Style waffle for on-the-go consumption and some exciting new varieties of MorningStar Farms, including a delicious pancake wrapped sausage on a stick. From a marketing standpoint, Mission Tiger is roaring back, helping kids gain better access to use sports. These are just a few examples of why we are so confident that we can sustain our snacks momentum, recover cereal and reaccelerate Frozen.\nNow let's discuss Europe shown on Slide #28. Europe had another outstanding quarter, growing net sales 8% and operating profit by 28%, even as it lapped strong year-ago growth for both metrics. While volume was down against the tough comparisons, Europe's RGM efforts continue to generate price/mix growth. And productivity also helped to cover costs, enabling increased A&P investment.\nOn Slide #29, you can see that we experienced organic net sales growth in both snacks and cereal in the first quarter despite what were very tough comparisons on a 2-year basis. In snacks, the growth is underpinned by fantastic momentum in consumption for Pringles, which gained share in markets like Germany, Italy and Spain, and lagged the category double-digit growth in the U.K. only because of tougher comparisons.\nWe should also point out that in portable wholesome snacks where categories are rebounding on a return to consumer mobility, our efforts to revitalize brands like Rice Krispies Squares and Pop-Tarts are starting to pay off, with share gains in markets like the U.K. and Italy. In cereal, consumption is moderating across the region as consumer mobility and price elasticity resumes. While we have gained share in the U.K. and Germany, we have ceded share in other markets in part because of lapping tougher comparisons. Nevertheless, some key supported brands continue to do well, as shown on this slide.\nA quick word about the situation in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine represent less than 1.5% of our total company net sales and less than 10% of our sales in Europe. We have suspended shipments and investments into Russia, which will have a direct impact on our sales and profit in Europe this year. This is incorporated into our updated guidance. Overall, though, Kellogg Europe is off to a very good start to 2022, and we feel good about the business.\nNow let's discuss Latin America, turning to Slide #30. Latin America, too, faced notably impressive comparisons, particularly on a 2-year CAGR basis and especially on operating profit. But this business got off to a good start, with year-on-year net sales growth driven by price/mix growth and operating profit that declined less than we had expected.\nSlide #31 shows that our Latin America net sales growth was led by snacks. Here, too, Pringles is showing impressive momentum, outpacing the category double-digit growth in Mexico and Brazil. In portable wholesome snacks, our consumption has rebounded faster than the category in our principal markets of Mexico and Puerto Rico. And cereal category consumption growth remains robust across the region, and we outpaced the category in key markets. However, tough comparisons and regulatory hurdles in Mexico negatively impacted our cereal net sales in the quarter. Nonetheless, our Latin America business continues to perform well.\nLet's finish our business review with AMEA on Slide #32. Quarter 1 featured another exceptional performance by our fastest-growing region. Despite lapping a strong 2-year CAGR for volume, AMEA continued to leverage RGM for exceptional price realization across the region, which helped it offset the margin impact of high costs. The result was double-digit growth in both net sales and operating profit versus the prior year.\nSlide #33 shows how AMEA's net sales growth was generated across all 3 of our product category groups in the region. Noodles was once again the largest contributor to the growth, reflecting exceptional growth by Multipro in West Africa and our continued expansion of the Kellogg's Noodles brand in markets like Egypt and South Africa.\nOur strong snacks growth was led by Pringles, which sustained goods consumption growth even as it entered the quarter with low inventories coming out of last year's COVID-related production restrictions. In portable wholesome snacks, our double-digit growth was strong enough to gain share in Australia and in the rest of the region. In cereal, the overall region's category has decelerated to modest growth, but we had gained share led by Australia, Korea and South Africa.\nSo to close out our prepared remarks, let me briefly summarize with Slide #35. We're off to a very good start to the year. We remain right on strategy, as ever focused on dependable, balanced financial delivery. We are navigating well through unprecedented cost and supply challenges. And through it all, we have sustained top line momentum, both in net sales and consumption growth. This reflects the strength of our reshaped portfolio, particularly our international markets and our North America snacks and frozen businesses. It also reflects what we have done on revenue growth management in order to help cover rising costs.\nPut it all together, and we come out of quarter 1 ahead of plan, which is an important benefit as we look ahead to continued uncertain market conditions. We are affirming our guidance for the year, and we are increasing the cash we return to shareowners.\nAs always, I can't thank enough the talented, resourceful and persevering Kellogg employees who have made this performance and our bright prospects possible.\nAnd with that, we'll open up the line for questions."

My name is Daisy, and I'll be the operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may now begin your conference call.\n\nJohn P. Renwick\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Planning, Kellogg Company\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as comments regarding our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSlide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings.\nThis is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic and supply and labor disruptions when the length and severity of these issues and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict.\nA recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com.\nAs always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I think we can all agree that 2021 was yet another unprecedented year. In addition to lapping an unusually strong 2020, we managed through an operating environment that was more challenging than any other that we can remember.\nThe pandemic persisted, requiring a sustained focus on employee safety, giving back to our communities and working differently. Bottlenecks and shortages on everything from labor to materials to freight impeded supply across the global economy and created incremental costs and inefficiencies that were difficult to plan for. Finally, there was one more extreme challenge in 2021, the acceleration of cost inflation to levels the industry hadn't seen in a decade. Our particular situation was complicated further by a fire in one of our U.S. cereal plants, followed by a labor strike across all 4 U.S. cereal plants. The fire further strained our network and our ability to build inventory, which served to worsen the situation when we experienced the labor strike.\nWe are pleased to have our team back to work. Strikes are painful for everyone, and not only did this strike affect our employees' lives. It also had a near-term financial impact on the company. It negatively impacted sales and profit in the fourth quarter of 2021, and it will have carryover cost impacts in quarter 1 2022. It will also have sales impacts the second quarter as we continue to rebuild inventories. In the end, though, we did what we believe was right for the business over the long term.\nWorking through these challenges required extraordinary efforts by our employees who clearly rose to the occasion. From safety precautions and volunteerism to incredible agility and creativity by our supply chain to the actions we took to help mitigate the profit impact of high costs, including productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, we executed well. The result was delivery of the 2021 guidance we have been raising or reaffirming since early in the year, even despite the labor strike extending well beyond what we had incorporated into our latest guidance.\nSo we're in good condition as we head into 2022. Our international regions continue to demonstrate very strong momentum, each growing ahead of their long-term targets and featuring strong in-market performance and responsible price realization.\nIn North America, our snacks and frozen businesses are showing momentum, with 2-year compound annual growth in consumption led by leading world-class brands.\nThe capabilities we enhanced in recent years are paying off. Our data and analytics capabilities are making our marketing dollars go further. Our e-commerce capabilities are sustaining momentum in that emerging channel. Our innovation pipeline is as strong as ever. And you can see how our capabilities around revenue growth management have improved just by looking at the strength of our price/mix performance.\nOur cash flow remains strong, benefiting from discipline on restructuring outlays, prioritization of capital investment and strong management of core working capital. Along with a deleveraged balance sheet, this gives us financial flexibility, enabling us to increase the cash we return to share owners and keep our powder dry for potential M&A opportunities.\nWe have some work to do. Economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages persist. And after our supply was further disrupted by the fire and strike, we are in the process of recovering production, inventory and service levels as well as commercial programs in that business.\nAnd as you'll hear in a moment, we are guiding toward another year of balanced growth even as we take a prudent planning stance toward the current operating environment.\nImportantly, we remain on our strategy, deploy for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide #7. This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady balanced financial delivery. It is designed to accommodate evolving industry conditions, and it is working.\nAnd equally importantly, we remain committed to our values as a company. We don't really strive to grow. We strive to grow the right way. Accordingly, we continue to make progress on better days, our ESG-oriented program. Just a few better days, highlights from quarter 4 are shared on Slide #8. As you can see, we remain active in this area, both behind the scenes with donations and sustainability work, but also leveraging some of this good work in our commercial activation.\nLet me now turn it over to Amit so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\n\nAmit Banati\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide #10 summarizes our full year results for 2021. As you can see, we met or exceeded our full year guidance on all 4 key metrics. Organic net sales growth came in at 3.5% ahead of our guidance range and equating to a 2-year CAGR of nearly 5%. Clearly, this is strong growth, and it reflects good momentum in the vast majority of our business.\nCurrency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit declined by less than 2% within the guidance range we had last quarter. Importantly, we achieved this in spite of the labor strike that began in the fourth quarter, extending much longer than we had assumed. On a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding from 2019, the since divested businesses, this equates to nearly 4% growth, a very strong performance amidst the significant headwinds that Steve mentioned.\nCurrency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increased by more than 1%, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. And cash flow came in at $1.15 billion, in line with our guidance for $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. And outside of the pandemic lift at 2020, our highest level since 2014, despite having divested major businesses back in 2019.\nSlide #11 offers a similar summary for the fourth quarter. As expected, Q4 was the quarter most affected by supply disruptions. Industry-wide bottlenecks and shortages were equally or more prevalent than they were in quarter 3. And we also endured the labor strike, which ended up lasting almost the entire fourth quarter. These factors, along with lapping the year ago quarter's extra week, reduced year-on-year declines in currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit and earnings per share.\nMeanwhile, though organic basis net sales growth remained very strong led by sustained momentum in key businesses and brands, along with strong price realization around the world. So aside from transitory supply-related factors, the business remained in good shape through quarter 4.\nNow let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide #12. As you can see, our organic net sales growth was more than 5% in the quarter and 3.5% for the full year, translating into 2-year CAGRs of 4% and 5%, respectively. Volume for the year, of course, lapped last year's strong pandemic-driven gains, particularly in the first half. In quarter 4, it was also affected by supply disruptions, particularly in North America, where we also endured the labor strike in our cereal business.\nPrice/mix growth for the year was more than 5%. This reflects the revenue growth management actions we took all year as we endeavor to cover rising cost inflation. This price/mix growth accelerated to nearly 9% in quarter 4, giving you an idea of just how much our cost inflation has accelerated and just how well we are executing revenue growth management. Also contributing to it is a relative lack of merchandising activity amidst supply disruptions.\nOutside of organic growth, we lapped 2020's once every 6 years 53rd week in quarter 4. And foreign currency translation, which has been a tailwind in the first half, turned into a modest headwind in quarter 4.\nMoving down the income statement, Slide #13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, our gross profit declined year-on-year in quarter 4. Our productivity and revenue growth management actions continued to substantially cover market-driven cost inflation even as the latter continued to accelerate. However, there was significant incremental cost and disruption stemming from the current operating environment. And then on top of that came the supply disruptions and costs related to the strike in our U.S. cereal business. These could not be covered with productivity and pricing.\nFor the full year, we delivered gross profit that was below 2020's unusually high level but still higher than the prepandemic 2019. This is a good performance given the decades high commodity and freight costs, the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, and then the fire and strike. As we have said, in this high cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth.\nOn Slide #14, we see SG&A expense, which is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D and overhead. Last year's quarter 3 and quarter 4 were unusual in that they included incremental A&P investment delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. They also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals. But comparing this year's SG&A expense to 2019, both for fourth quarter and full year, we see it was lower. A&P in 2021 was down modestly versus 2020, owing to lapping a 53rd week and to restraining investment behind supply-constrained brands, but it remained higher than 2019, reflecting good sustained support. Overhead, meanwhile, was lower in '21 than 2020, principally because of lapping high-incentive compensation, but it was also lower than 2019. This 2-year decrease is related to reduced travel and meetings during the pandemic as well as some benefits not likely to recur, but it also reflects the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture.\nIf you look at operating profit on Slide #15, you can see that our fourth quarter came in below that of 2019 as we saw no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages and we experienced incremental disruption and costs related to the labor strike. However, for the full year, our operating profit in 2021 finished above that of 2019, even though that year included 7 months of profit from since divested businesses. So notwithstanding the severe transitory disruptions we experienced in quarter 4 and the lapping of an exceptional pandemic-driven 2020, there is no question that our operating profit remains on an upward path.\nSlide #16 shows the operating profit of each of our regions. As you can see, the international regions had another strong year, posting growth on top of growth. The only region whose operating profit is below 2020 and 2019 is North America, where the bottlenecks and shortages were most acute and where we experienced the fire and strike.\nMoving down the P&L. Let's turn to Slide #17 and the items below operating profit. Interest expense decreased this year on lower debt and the lapping of last year's debt redemption costs in the fourth quarter. Other income decreased because of lower pension income. Effective tax rate came in at 22% rate we had guided to. JV earnings and minority interests were collectively less negative than last year, owing to this year's consolidation of our Africa joint ventures. Average shares outstanding were lower year-on-year due to buybacks we executed early in the year.\nLet's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide #18. Cash flow finished in line with our guidance. As expected, we finished 2021 with a cash flow that was below last year's unusually high level, but well ahead of prepandemic years, which are the more relevant comparisons. Versus 2018 and 2019, this improvement in cash flow generation was driven by higher operating profit, reduced restructuring-related cash outlays, continued effective management of core working capital and a moderation in our capital expenditure as a percentage of net sales.\nMeanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. We continue to reduce net debt even despite this year's increase in cash returned to share owners in the form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition remains quite strong.\nLet's now turn to our guidance for 2022, starting with some key planning assumptions shown on Slide #19. We approach our 2022 plans with a prudent planning stance given the current operating environment, including several assumptions that many of you likely have already considered in your models. Already high-cost inflation accelerates in 2022 to a double-digit rate, with first half inflation higher than the second half inflation.\nContinued productivity and revenue growth management actions continue, which have been successful so far in largely covering market-driven cost inflation. The current environment of bottlenecks and shortages persist at least through the first half before moderating across the second half.\nThe U.S. cereal fire and labor strike has a carryover impact through the first half, as we will discuss further in a moment. At-home demand growth continues to gradually decelerate in part reflected by price elasticity gradually returning over the course of the year. In addition, reinvestment is restored behind capabilities and in a gradual progression on commercial activity behind supply-constrained brands.\nAside from the (inaudible) strike impact, none of this should be news. But in the first half, they do serve to offset what is good underlying momentum in our business, which will then be planar to see in the second half.\nWith that as background, let's now discuss items for 2022, as shown on Slide #20. Organic basis net sales growth should be about 3% driven by continued strong price/mix around the world. Our international regions have strong momentum but lapped strong 2-year volume growth, while North America faces the aforementioned supply constraints, which may impede shipments early in the year. Adjusted basis operating profit growth should be in the 1% to 2% range, excluding currency. As mentioned, we are planning around the assumption of an environment of high cost inflation and economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, particularly in the first half, where we are also experiencing carryover impact from last year's strike and fire. In addition, we plan to gradually restore investment in A&P and overhead.\nAdjusted basis earnings per share growth should also be in the 1% to 2% range before currency. We expect other income to decline because of lower expected pension income, and our effective tax rate is projected to move higher to about 22.5%. These should be partially offset by about a 1% decrease in average shares outstanding as we increased our repurchase activity this year. Not included in these forecasts is any attempt to guide for foreign currency translation, which is unpredictable. But if rates today were to prevail, they would represent a headwind of somewhere between 2% and 3%.\nCash flow is expected to grow in line with reported basis operating profit and EPS growth, depending on where currency turns out to be, putting us in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range and featuring continued discipline on restructuring outlays, core working capital and capital expenditure.\nOur plan is to continue to drive balanced financial delivery, balance between time line growth, profit growth and cash flow growth, even amidst what is clearly a challenging business environment right now.\nThere are some quarterly facing peculiarities shown on Slide #21 that you should keep in mind as you model 2022. Specifically, we should see an uneven first half versus second half. To begin with, profit comparisons are the toughest in the first half. Then on top of that, this year's first half has added pressures around higher input cost inflation, persisting bottlenecks and shortages, and the strike and fire impacts that we discussed earlier. These begin to clear up or moderate in the second half when you should see profit growth not only resume but get an additional year-on-year lift in quarter 4 from lapping the impact of the fire and the strike.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses.\n\nSteven A. Cahillane\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Kellogg Company\n\nThanks, Amit. I'll start with Slide #23, which shows the 2-year compound annual growth rates and net sales across our 4 regions.\nBecause of the outsized impact of COVID in 2020, this is really the best way to evaluate 2021's performance. And what you see is consistently good 2-year growth across all regions in all quarters and the full year. There was notable strength in our 3 international regions driven by cereal, by snacks and by noodles and other. And North America fared reasonably well in the context of what were, by far, the most severe supply disruptions.\nLet's review each of our regions in turn, starting with North America on Slide #24. North America's 2021 performance has to be viewed in the context of its year ago comparisons and unusually severe supply constraints. First, remember what we were lapping, a pandemic-related surge in demand, particularly for our most at-home-oriented categories, which are cereal, frozen from the griddle and veggie foods. This not only led to exceptionally strong organic net sales growth in 2020, but it also triggered exceptional plant utilization and operating leverage driving up profit that year. We also were lapping a once every 6 years extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter in 2020. Excluding that 53rd week and any impacts from divestitures or currency translation, North America's operating profit in 2020 grew nearly double digits.\nThen let's remember the unusual supply constraints we faced in 2021. We ended the year at full capacity utilization in cereal and key elements of our frozen from the griddle categories, with the pandemic delaying our ability to expand capacity as previously planned. We then experienced what all companies experienced and unprecedented disruption in global supply chains, which not only impeded shipments and slowed production, but also contributed to unexpected costs. And to make matters worse, we suffered the misfortune of a major fire at one of our cereal plants, followed by a labor strike at all 4 of our U.S. cereal plants.\nSo to finish 2021 with a 2% 2-year CAGR in organic net sales growth and roughly 1% 2-year CAGR on operating profit, excluding since divested businesses, is a good achievement. This reflects momentum sustained in key brands outside of cereal. It also reflects productivity and revenue growth management to offset the market-driven inflation in input costs, and it reflects remarkable execution amid unprecedented business conditions.\nLet's dig into each of the 3 major category groups within North America, starting with the largest, snacks, on Slide #25. Our North America snacks business finished 2021 with organic net sales growth of 7% year-on-year and 5% on a 2-year CAGR basis. This represents a continuation of multiyear momentum for this business and reflects the strength of our brands.\nTwo of these world-class brands are shown on Slide #26. Pringles, closing in on $900 million in retail sales in the U.S., had another strong year in 2021. Not only did it gain share year-on-year. But as you can see on the slide, its 2-year CAGRs well outpaced the category all year long and even accelerated as the year progressed. The gains were driven by innovation like scorching, the expansion of pack formats like multipacks and effective advertising from the Super Bowl on. And then there's Cheez-It, now well over $1 billion in U.S. retail sales. This brand drove most of our share gains in crackers in 2021. As you can see, it continues to well outpace the category on a 2-year CAGR basis as well driven by innovation like Snap'd, pack formats like (inaudible) and effective advertising, which drove the core business.\nBut these aren't our only world-class snacking brands. Take a look at the continued momentum in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats shown on Slide #27. Pop-Tarts, with over $800 million in U.S. retail sales, continued its growth momentum in 2021, outpacing the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR in every quarter. Similarly, Rice Krispies Treats also sustained its momentum in 2021. These treats generate $350 million in retail sales. And not only did they gain share again in 2021. Their 2-year CAGRs continued to well outpace the portable wholesome snacks category. Like Pringles and Cheez-It, these are world-class differentiated brands that respond well to innovation and brand building.\nTurning to Slide #28. Let's discuss our 2 North American frozen businesses. Lapping high single-digit growth in 2020, these businesses collectively sustained good momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis even despite operating at or near full capacity across much of their product lines. Even better, we have capacity coming online in the first half of 2022.\nSlide #29 shows how these 2 world-class brands performed in market. With almost $900 million in U.S. retail sales, Eggo sustained solid momentum growth on a 2-year CAGR basis in 2021, only slightly trailing the category as it operated at capacity. Morningstar Farms, our leading plant-based brand, generating nearly $400 million in U.S. retail sales, and it finished the year outpacing the frozen veg/vegan category on a 2-year CAGR basis. So similar to snacks, our Frozen Foods brands continue to demonstrate very strong momentum.\nLet's round out our discussion of North America with cereal shown on Slide #30. In addition to lapping 2020's pandemic-aided high single-digit growth, North America cereal faced the most challenging of supply conditions. Recall that we had already been delayed due to the pandemic in previously planned capacity expansions. Then just as we were adding capacity came the economy-wide shortages and bottlenecks. In late July, we suffered a fire in our Memphis plant, which not only strained our network further, but impeded our ability to build inventory ahead of what would eventually be a strike at all 4 of our U.S. cereal plans, spanning almost the entire fourth quarter.\nThe result of not being able to ship enough product and the related reduction in commercial support for these products was a sharp year-on-year decline in net sales. This was mostly in the second half. In fact, through the first half, our 2-year CAGR for this business was roughly flat. Unfortunately, this has resulted in low inventories and even out of stocks in stores for many of our brands. And we, therefore, elected to pull back on commercial activity. Not only have we had to pull back on A&P investment. We've also had to dramatically reduce our in-store merchandising. The latter can be seen on Slide #31, specifically using scanner data that chart captures the year-on-year changes in the percent of retail sales volume that was sold on any promotion. It shows how Kellogg was, like the rest of the category, returning to prepandemic levels of merchandising in 2021, but then it shows just how much we had to pull back in the fourth quarter, especially late in the quarter due to the strike.\nLet's talk briefly about how we are thinking about the post strike and fire recovery of this business shown on Slide #32. As previously mentioned, the fire and strikes cost impacts spans across the fourth quarter of 2021 and quarter 1 2022, owing to carryover of costs and lost operating leverage. In addition, there will be some missed net sales opportunities as we work to catch up on inventory, both ours and that of our customers. In the end, it will be the second half before we can truly be back on a full commercial program, though we will get started as soon as we can in supporting priority brands and SKUs. This is incorporated into our guidance.\nNow let's turn to our international regions whose financial performance is shown on Slide #33. Remember, these are not small businesses. These 3 regions collectively account for more than 40% of our net sales. And what they delivered in 2021 was nothing less than impressive, particularly given worldwide supply challenges. All 3 posted strong organic basis net sales growth in 2021, with both volume and price mix growing on top of what was strong growth last year. And on operating profit, all posted growth in the high single digits or double digits on a currency-neutral basis.\nKellogg Europe's organic net sales growth is shown on Slide #34. In 2021, we sustained strong growth momentum in a region of the world that is comprised predominantly of mature developed markets and an intensely competitive retailer environment. Yet we grew net sales organically for a fourth consecutive year in 2021 and growing both volume and price/mix.\nAs you can see on Slide #35, the growth was driven by strong in-market performance in both cereal and Pringles. In cereal, master brand advertising and selective innovation continued to drive consumption growth ahead of the category on a 2-year CAGR basis in key markets. Pringles, meanwhile, also continues to outpace the category in key markets. The new Sizzl'n line has proven to be incremental, while strong execution of marketing programs, including this year's Euro Soccer Tournament, has continued to drive the base business.\nSimilarly, we sustained multiyear momentum in Latin America, as indicated on Slide #36. We grew volume in 2021 on top of last year's surge, and we increased our price/mix in order to help cover the double hit of high input costs and adverse transactional foreign currency impact.\nSlide #37 shows how this organic net sales growth has been generated in both snacks and cereal using 2-year CAGRs. Importantly, this growth was underpinned by good in-market performance. In cereal, our consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis continues to outpace the category in key markets in 2021. Even on a 1 year basis, we realized share gains in key markets. Pringles, meanwhile, also gained share, notably in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil.\nWe'll finish our review with our largest international region in terms of net sales, AMEA, which is shown on Slide #38. This is yet another international region that built on multiyear track record for organic net sales growth. In 2021, Kellogg AMEA grew net sales on an organic basis for a seventh consecutive year. And it not only grew on top of 2020's strong growth, but it accelerated its growth to levels we haven't seen before. Growing both volume and price/mix, this 2021 performance reflected broad-based gains geographically and across category groups.\nYou can see this in the 2-year CAGR trends shown on Slide 39. We continue to see strong organic growth in snacks, cereal and noodles. And in-market, our AMEA cereal consumption outpaced the region's overall category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis led by key markets ranging from Australia to India to Saudi Arabia. Pringles recorded similarly impressive consumption performance in 2021 in spite of supply disruptions related to the pandemic. Not only did its consumption outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year basis for the overall region, but it gained share in many of those same key markets.\nAllow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #41. What you have seen from us this year should give you confidence of what we can do going forward. Firstly, we executed well through what were extraordinarily challenging business conditions, overcoming obstacles to deliver on full year guidance that we had already raised earlier this year. We faced a rapid acceleration in market-driven input cost inflation, and you saw us substantially cover it with productivity and with very effective revenue growth management actions that enabled us to realize price early and sufficiently. We faced economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, which created supply disruptions and incremental costs, yet we work through them to continue to service our customers around the world. We even faced the misfortune of a major fire in one of our U.S. plants, followed by a labor strike in one of our businesses, and we worked through those interruptions as well.\nSecondly, it should be clear that we have strong business momentum. Our international businesses continued to deliver strong growth this year, even accelerating from strong growth last year. They grew in snacks, and they grew in cereal. In North America, our largest business, snacks, delivered outstanding growth and category share performance all year long. Brands like Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats have never been stronger. And in our Frozen Foods businesses, we continue to show growth momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis. Eggo's growth was strong enough to run up against capacity limitations, which we are resolving. And Morningstar Farms plant-based foods growth came with increased household penetration.\nAnd finally, we entered the new year in good financial condition. Our cash flow remains strong, and we have delevered our balance sheet, giving us good financial flexibility. The result of all this was yet another year of balanced financial delivery in 2021, which we expect to sustain reliably and dependently in 2022. And driving this dependable performance are the talent and determination of our world-class employees who deserve tremendous credit for working through unprecedented challenges and keeping Kellogg on this path of profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'd be happy to take any questions that you might have."

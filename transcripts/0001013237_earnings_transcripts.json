Welcome to the FactSet Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Toomy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Toomey\n\nSenior Associate, Citigroup Inc, Research Division\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2. Discussions on this call may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation, and in our earnings release issued earlier today, both of which can be found on our website at investor.factset.com.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise noted, relative performance metrics reflect changes as compared to the respective fiscal 2024 period. Also consistent with the past 3 quarters, please note that in fiscal '25, FactSet started reporting organic ASV, rather than organic ASV plus professional services, to focus on the recurring nature of our revenues.\nJoining me today are Sanoke Viswanathan, Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer; and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Sanoke Viswanathan.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm Sanoke Viswanathan, and I'm honored to speak with you as the new CEO of FactSet.\nI want to begin by recognizing Phil Snow for his remarkable leadership. Over more than 3 decades, Phil has helped propel FactSet into a global leader in financial data and analytics, scaling our business to well over $2 billion, while staying relentlessly client-focused and innovating with purpose, establishing the company as an industry leader. He leaves behind the legacy underpinned by our open platform, superior client service and deep workflow integration. We're all grateful, and I'm personally inspired to build on that legacy.\nLet me share why I'm here and what excites me about FactSet's future. We are at a strategic inflection point in our industry. AI and data-driven innovation are transforming how financial institutions operate, invest and serve clients, which is driving increased demand for quality data. My career has always been at the intersection of finance and technology, and I believe the next decade is going to be defined by those companies that can deliver trusted, integrated financial intelligence to their clients.\nI've been a FactSet client for years and I have been studying the company deeply for the last 6 months, and I believe we have a unique opportunity to become the leading AI-powered financial intelligence platform for our clients. In my first week here, I've visited our major offices and met hundreds of colleagues. I'm inspired by the energy and passion across our teams to continue innovating and rolling out new products, data sets and solutions for our clients. I have kicked off reviews of our product road map and client implementations, including various AI initiatives. I've also been welcomed by dozens of senior clients and partners that are keen to explore opportunities for growth.\nThis last week has reinforced my long-held beliefs that I'm sure you all share as many of you are also direct users of FactSet Solutions. Number one, we provide unparalleled client service. Clients like their FactSet consultant and counting them to be their trusted partner when it comes to resolving the most complex and sophisticated questions. This level of client conviction and trust has been earned by delivering high-quality solutions for decades, anchored in deep domain expertise and a client-centric culture. The passion for client service runs throughout the company, and I see it in my leadership team, most of whom started their careers as a FactSet consultant.\nNumber two, we are deeply embedded in our clients. Across the buy-side, dealmakers and wealth clients, we are used in their front, middle and back offices to execute complex tasks every single day. Our data, tools, insights and solutions help clients research and create new business opportunities, perform complex analysis and execute transactions in the front office. We run performance, attribution and risk analytics for over 6 million institutional client portfolios every night, and help streamline reporting and operations, minimize risk and drive productivity. We also integrate more than 15 million wealth portfolios, enabling advisers to monitor their books of business like never before. We have a great starting point as an enterprise partner to enable clients to transform and even disrupt their existing workflows. And this is evident in our recent performance.\nNumber three, we are uniquely geared for collaboration. FactSet's open architecture is fundamentally designed to enable clients to combine their own proprietary knowledge with FactSet's proprietary data sets and insights, and with other third-party data our clients see value in. We are cloud-native, think API first, and partner every day with hundreds of data providers worldwide. We are not bogged down with legacy integrations or business model conflicts. This is a huge advantage when it comes to implementing AI and agenetic workflows at scale, with dozens and hundreds of integration points up and down the technology stack and across the ecosystem of our clients.\nIn sum, I believe we are extremely well positioned to become the leading AI-powered financial intelligence platform for our clients. I recognize there is significant work ahead of us as AI continues to transform our industry and creates new competitive dynamics. As I look ahead, my focus will be on engaging with clients on their top priorities, and continuing to build my knowledge base about FactSet's data, tools and services. I will be working closely with my leadership team to refine our long-term vision and strategy and product road map with particular emphasis on AI.\nWe are operating from a position of strength. FactSet has a long track record of profitable growth, a differentiated position in the market and a distinct value proposition for our clients. With more than $600 million of free cash flow, and a strong balance sheet, we are able to invest confidently in our future.\nGiven the growth we are experiencing, combined with the significant opportunity ahead of us, we are continuing to invest in the business this year, and Helen will share more details shortly. I believe in a disciplined measured approach to investing for long-term growth, guided by the needs of our clients and focused on generating attractive returns for our shareholders. I look forward to partnering with clients, colleagues and shareholders and sharing more of my vision in the spring.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Helen to discuss our Q4 performance and FY '26 outlook.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me start by welcoming you Sanoke. I look forward to working with you for the next phase of FactSet's journey. It's going to be an exciting time for everyone. With that, I will now share fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 results.\nThis year has been marked by change in the markets and economic policies and in technology. Against this backdrop, FactSet continued to perform well, executing against our plan and finishing fiscal 2025 with strength. We made meaningful progress against our multiyear AI road map, embedded FactSet deeper into client workflows by integrating liquidity book for seamless buy-side trading, and added [ IRN ] to serve corporate IR needs, all while continuing to advance our open platform strategy.\nFor FY '25, we added $127 million of organic ASV, which is near the top end of our guidance range. Annual revenue increased to $2.3 billion, while adjusted operating margin was 36.3%, and adjusted EPS grew to $16.98, all comfortably within our guidance ranges. We anticipate a better performance in the second half of the year, and I'm really pleased to report excellent fourth quarter results.\nOur Q4 organic ASV of $81.8 million was the largest quarter in the company's history, representing a sequential acceleration in growth to 5.7%. This improvement was fueled by recent wins in wealth and asset management, underpinned by increasing demand for our data solutions. For Q4, [indiscernible] drivers came from data, wealth solutions and our analytics suite. Within data, demand for real-time and benchmarks was significant for the buy-side. We're pleased with the early success of our investments in AI as a number of trials were converted into signed deals in the quarter. We have top line momentum as we close fiscal 2025. With that, let's review the quarterly results in more detail.\nStarting with our regional performance. In the Americas, organic ASV growth this quarter accelerated sequentially to 6%. What was encouraging was the breadth of growth, with asset managers increasing their technology investments and wealth continuing to be a standout performer with our platform capturing share from legacy providers.\nIn EMEA, organic ASV growth improved to 4%. We executed on strategic wins this quarter, including a competitor displacement at a large asset manager. While we are seeing a recovery in the U.K. market, midsized asset managers and asset owners in the region continue to face secular headwinds. Importantly, we're using this period to deepen our relationships and expand our footprint within existing accounts.\nIn Asia Pacific, organic ASV growth increased 7% this quarter. While we face pricing pressures in some markets, we're offsetting this through solution expansion and new client acquisition. The demand for middle office solutions and AI-ready data is strong here, as firms modernize their operations to compete globally. Our workstation growth reflects increasing adoption by local and regional players who recognize they need institutional-grade tools to serve sophisticated clients. Across all regions, we're seeing the same trend clients are consolidating vendors and choosing platforms that can deliver integrated AI-enhanced workflows. Clients want comprehensive solutions that transform how they operate.\nNow turning our results from a firm type perspective. Wealth delivered strong Q4 performance with continued organic growth at greater than 10%, fueled by 7-figure deals, including two competitive displacements. We successfully captured market share from incumbent providers while driving higher expansion through our real-time and markets data offerings. Our land and expand strategy is proving effective, as existing desktop clients increasingly adopt our data feeds and digital solutions. Off-platform ASV with wealth clients grew more than 50% year-over-year, continuing to expand our enterprise footprint outside of the wealth workstation. For FY '25, Steelmakers organic ASV grew 4% year-over-year. Banking delivered strong quarterly results as clients are expressing confidence in our AI road map and choosing FactSet as their partner of choice in their own AI journey.\nWith multiyear contracts securely in place with all of our top 15 largest banking clients, including all of the global bulge bracket banks, and leading independent banks, we are leveraging our long-standing C-suite relationships to position for growth across the client's enterprise. Our banker productivity tools continue to drive demand with [ pitch creator ], [ logo intern ] and our market-leading office integration solutions helping both retention and expansion. Lastly, Improved market conditions led to better lateral and summer hiring trends as experienced across our bulge bracket clients.\nOutside of banking, PVC and corporates also performed well during the quarter. The integration of [ Erwin ] and FactSet provides IR users with an end-to-end workflow solution, which is driving seat count growth and accelerating cross-sell momentum as we expand further into the office of the [ CFO ]. Back in June, we noted that most of our Q4 pipeline was from the institutional buy-side. It delivered its largest quarterly ASV increase on record, accelerating FY '25 organic ASV growth to 4%. This increase reflects stronger demand for our analytics solutions in the front and middle office and especially for data.\nAsset managers experienced strong growth with multiple 7-figure wins with improvement in both retention and expansion. Hedge funds growth accelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by demand for data, our portfolio life cycle offering with liquidity book and street account. Asset owners stabilized from last quarter with acceleration driven by an increase in demand for our data solutions and strength in the middle office.\nBoth in partnerships and CGS accelerated to 8% in FY '25, reflecting significantly improved retention, continued high issuance activity and demand for our proprietary data offerings. Our results reflect, in part, the strategic investments we made throughout the year. We expanded our data content with real-time feeds, benchmarks and aftermarket research to create a more differentiated workflow ready data universe. And we immersed AI into our solutions, and launched 6 distinct offerings that help automate complex tasks and enable future agentive workflows. These initiatives improved renewal rates, expanded client opportunities and contributed approximately 2/3 of our organic ASV growth acceleration this year. These investments positioned us well to compete effectively in a challenging environment.\nWhile we're encouraged by this quarter's momentum, we recognize that our success came against the backdrop of tight client budgets and evolving market dynamics. Clients are being strategic in their technology investments and look for battle-tested solutions with institutional credibility. This selectivity can mean longer sales cycles and rigorous scrutiny, but our performance reflects two key differentiators, the quality and breadth of our data and technology.\nOur competitive advantage starts with something that simply cannot be replicated easily. Decades of curated connected financial data that improves every day. Here's what's changed. We're not just collecting more data. We're making it exponentially more valuable through AI enhancement and real-time integration. Our largest client wins this year demonstrated strong positioning, [ or were ] direct displacements at wealth and buy-side clients, three involved replacing clients' internal solutions and one was a new managed services mandate for an existing client.\nOur largest losses tell a different story, with two clients acquired by other companies and two strategic cancellations we initiated in Q2 as we noted on a prior call. Importantly, we secured large renewals early, especially with premier global banking clients, generating momentum and pipeline visibility for fiscal 2026.\nFactSet's ongoing investments in AI and continued progress driving tangible workflow improvements is being recognized by our largest clients. We are placing increased value in working alongside trusted partners to navigate the integration of AI advancements into their own businesses. This success translates into improved quality in our ASP.\nWhile annual price increases contributed less this year due to lower CPI, significantly stronger retention largely offset this impact, demonstrating that our products are mission critical and our investments to enhance our data and incorporate AI into our offerings are resonating with clients. We've also steadily improved expansion with existing clients each quarter this year, while new business growth accelerated in the second half. We continue structuring competitive multiyear deals to win new logos when the total contract value creates strong customer lifetime value. As a result, our client count grew to 9,000, nearly a 10% increase year-over-year, driven by additions in corporate and wealth clients. Notably, we now have over 237,000 users with wealth driving growth in Q4 and for the full fiscal year.\nTurning now to financial results. Fourth quarter revenues increased 6.2% year-over-year, reaching $597 million. In fiscal 2025, we delivered 5.4% overall revenue growth, and 4.4% on an organic basis. Marking more than 45 consecutive years of top line growth. This track record demonstrates our resilience and consistent performance throughout market cycles. Alongside top line growth, we continued disciplined expense management in Q4 to help self-fund our strategic investments while absorbing acquisition-related dilution. On an adjusted basis, operating expense for the quarter grew 9.5% year-over-year.\nPeople-related expenses increased $27 million, or 13%, primarily due to higher bonus accruals and workforce expansion, which included employees from our [ Irwin ] and liquidity book acquisition. Our head count grew less than 2% in the quarter, primarily in low-cost locations. Technology expenses grew $8 million, or 13%, reflecting higher internal use software amortization, and increased cloud and software spend. As stated, we are concentrating our spend in AI capabilities to maintain market leadership through product innovation.\nWe have effectively managed our other major expense categories. Third-party content costs increased $3 million versus the prior year, reflecting investments made in new data sets to support the research workflow, but our real estate expense rose $2 million due to renewed leases and return to office expenses. Lower other expenses reflect better receivables collection and decisions to reduce discretionary spend. These efforts resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 33.8% for Q4.\nAdjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter rose 8% on a year-over-year basis to $4.05, helped by a lower tax rate and a reduced number of weighted shares. For a detailed breakdown of our expense progression from revenue to adjusted operating income, and reconciliations of adjusted results with comparable GAAP measures, please reference the appendix in today's earnings presentation.\nOn capital allocation, we repurchased approximately 260,000 shares for $107 million during the quarter, concluding our $300 million fiscal 2025 share repurchase program. As of September 1, we began executing against the new $400 million share authorization program approved by the Board in June. We paid a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share today to shareholders of record as of August 29. As a reminder, we increased our dividend by 6% in Q3, marking our 26th consecutive year of dividend increases on a stock split adjusted basis. Combined, we returned over $460 million to shareholders in fiscal 2025 through dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our consistent commitment to delivering shareholder value.\nWe strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our term loan, achieving a gross debt leverage ratio of 1.5x, which provides significant financial flexibility. As part of our ongoing portfolio review, we divested [ RMS Partners ], a noncore sell-side research platform within our deal makers offering, just before fiscal year-end. This divestiture enables us to concentrate resources on our core growth areas and led to a onetime gain recognized in our GAAP results that had no material impact on our adjusted results in FY '25. To clarify, RMS Partners is distinct from our leading buy-side research management solution. We remain committed to our internal research notes offering for institutional buy-side clients, where our core workstation now features AI-powered workflows designed to enhance research efficiency and insight generation.\nWe're already seeing early positive signals from our past year's investment, and we plan to lean into areas where clients have demonstrated strong demand, and where we can achieve clear outcomes. For fiscal 2026 we'll continue building on our momentum while investing for future growth. We're executing on data expansion efforts, widening our real-time and pricing reference data capabilities, while extending proprietary data coverage across deep sector, such as in [ TMT ], Power and Utilities. We're embedding deeper into client workflows through our portfolio life cycle solution, further integrating OMS and IBOR to our platform. And we plan to simultaneously develop a comprehensive suite of AI-ready data and our own agenetic platform as part of a multiyear AI road map. These investments will support growth in fiscal 2026 across all of our firm types.\nWealth remains our growth engine. While we expect to continue to capitalize on competitor displacement opportunities, we plan to expand our offerings in both data feeds and analytics solutions, which include risk in OMS to meet the growing sophisticated needs of the advisers. We expect that buy-side will benefit from the integration of liquidity book, enabling us to fulfill larger portfolio life cycle opportunities across performance, reporting and trading. We expect our markets, pricing and reference and [ debt spark ] data feeds to continue to drive top line growth.\nWe expect the enhanced offerings in our deep sector data and aftermarket research to support dealmakers growth, allowing us to expand to other banking teams such as TMT and credit risk. Our clients should further benefit from the AI capabilities we provide to enhance their workflows. Our AI-ready data enhancements benefit all firm types, including partnerships. We're strategically managing relationships with the growing number of AI startups used by our clients. We've maintained control over commercial relationships with our clients and have protections in place for our intellectual property. Moving forward, we plan to carefully balance content monetization through select providers while preserving our direct market presence and revenue streams.\nWe expect to accelerate our focus on productivity. With the help of AI, we've been able to increase the speed of our content collection and expand our coverage in both street account and call street. Applying what we've learned from developing AI solutions for our clients, we plan to invest to improve client service, reduce our technology debt and further strengthen our infrastructure in areas such as data connectivity and cybersecurity. Experience in AI implementation reveals that quality data and middleware are not expensive, but essential investments, as companies who do not prioritize these foundations can face costly delays and challenges in capturing future benefits.\nWith that context, let's discuss our fiscal 2026 guidance. We anticipate continued strong demand for our solutions. Our outlook is supported by a first half sales pipeline that's comparable to last year. We expect continued momentum in wealth, in-line activity in banking and partners and stability in the buy-side. Given these dynamics, we're guiding to organic ASV growth of $100 million to $150 million, representing approximately 5% growth at the midpoint. We are taking a conservative approach to our guidance to reflect the current environment of longer sales cycles, and more rigorous client approval processes, and not due to reduced confidence in our competitive positioning or market demand.\nGAAP revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.45 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin range of 29.5% to 31%, and adjusted operating margin of 34% to 35.5%. This range incorporates expectations of higher technology and content costs and targeted investments in wealth and buy-side workflows. We expect some of these anticipated increases to be partially offset by productivity gains and cost discipline. Our wider margin provides us the flexibility to invest more if opportunities exceed expectations.\nOur GAAP EPS guidance range is from $14.55 to $15.25. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is from $16.90 to $17.60. For fiscal 2026 modeling purposes, net interest expense is expected between $43 million to $48 million. Capital expenditures are projected at $110 million to $120 million. Effective tax rate is projected to be between 18% and 19%.\nAs we enter fiscal 2026, we're positioned at an inflection point where our strategic investments are beginning to translate into measurable competitive advantages. The convergence of client demand for workflow integration, data monetization, and AI-enabled solutions creates a compelling opportunity for FactSet to expand our market presence, while deepening existing client and partnership relationships. We're not expecting dramatic market shift to impact our growth. Instead, we're methodically building capabilities that address genuine client needs while positioning FactSet to capitalize on secular trends, reshaping help financial professionals access, analyze and act on information.\nThis measured approach, combined with our established market presence and proven execution capabilities, forms a foundation for sustained value creation in the years ahead. Thank you for your time today. We'll now open up the call for questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Toomey, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Toomey\n\nSenior Associate, Citigroup Inc, Research Division\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Third Fiscal Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2. Discussions on this call may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Also, consistent with the last quarter, please note that starting fiscal 2025, FactSet is reporting organic ASV rather than organic ASV plus professional services to focus on the recurring nature of our revenues.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer; and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before we discuss our Q3 results, I just want to take a moment to recognize an important milestone for FactSet and for me personally. Earlier this month, we announced my decision to retire after 30 years with FactSet and the past decade as CEO. It's been a privilege to spend my career here working alongside such a talented, collaborative and mission-driven team. Together, we've expanded our data and workflow capabilities, deepened client relationships and more than doubled our revenue over the past 10 years, positioning FactSet as a trusted global enterprise leader in powering smarter, data-driven investment decisions.\nIt's been an incredible journey, and I'm proud of all we've accomplished together. Looking ahead, I'm even more confident in FactSet's future. I'm also pleased to share that Sanoke Viswanathan will become FactSet's next CEO in early September. Sanoke brings over 25 years of global leadership experience in financial services and technology, most recently at JPMorgan Chase. And he has a strong strategic mindset and a proven track record of delivering technology-driven growth at scale.\nAs FactSet prepares for its next chapter of leadership, I'm proud of the solid foundation we've established built on innovation, client trust and industry-leading data and workflow solutions. I'm confident Sanoke's leadership will guide FactSet through its next phase of growth and look forward to working with him closely to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition.\nWith that, let's turn to our third quarter results. In the third quarter, we achieved organic ASV growth of 4.5% year-over-year, fueled by recent wins in wealth, dealmakers and partnerships. We also delivered an adjusted operating margin of 36.8% and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.27. As we previously indicated, we anticipated stronger growth in the second half of this fiscal year, and we're pleased with our Q3 performance. These results reflect the successful execution of our enterprise solutions strategy and underscore our commitment to helping clients lower their total cost of ownership.\nWe continue to see positive trends in ASV retention, and I am pleased to report that both expansion within existing accounts and new business accelerated in the quarter. As you may recall, the fourth quarter is seasonally our highest ASV of the year. And with a healthy pipeline and growing momentum, we are well positioned for a strong close to the fiscal year. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our FY '25 guidance. Helen will cover our financial results and guidance in more detail later in her remarks.\nTurning to third quarter results. ASV retention remained strong at over 95%, while client retention was at 91%. Our client base grew to over 8,800 driven by strong demand from corporate wealth management and buy-side clients, including those added through the LiquidityBook acquisition. Our user count rose to over 220,000 primarily reflecting growth among wealth management users.\nStarting with our performance by region. In the Americas, organic ASV increased by 5%. The strength of this quarter was driven by higher banking and asset energy retention, coupled with higher demand in wealth, hedge funds and corporates.\nIn EMEA, organic ASV growth was 2%. We saw improved retention in banking and wealth. However, this was offset by lower contributions from the annual price increase and buy-side headwinds.\nIn Asia Pacific, organic ASV growth increased 7% primarily driven by higher retention in the banking sector. This growth was partially offset by the reduced pricing uplift and asset owner headwinds.\nNow turning to our results from a firm-type perspective. Wealth organic ASV maintained its double-digit growth pace in Q3, marking a second consecutive quarter of acceleration. We continue to capture market share by displacing incumbent providers with new business sales nearly double the number of new logos versus a year ago.\nOur product portfolio demonstrated broad-based strength among both new and existing clients, specifically a large 7-figure renewal and twice as many 6-figure wins as a year ago. Notably, we are growing FactSet's presence in wealth by selling more data feeds and digital solutions to clients who already use our industry-leading desktop solution across their organization. The attach rate for off-platform products continues to rise. And so far in FY '25, we are capturing attach rates that are around 1.5x what we saw in FY '24.\nWithin dealmakers, this quarter's banking gains were largely driven by the favorable comparison to last year's third quarter, which includes the impact of the UBS-Credit Suisse merger. Over the past 3 years, our seat count has grown considerably as we continue to displace incumbent providers as clients increasingly choose our best-in-class banking solutions.\nWe're also encouraged by meaningful improvements in retention, highlighted by the signing of several multiyear deals, including a favorable outcome on a large global banking renewal. These long-term agreements reinforce FactSet's position as a trusted enterprise partner and create new opportunities for future growth. While it's still early to assess some hiring trends, preliminary indications suggest they may be in line with last year's levels.\nWe're optimistic about our ability to expand the footprint of FactSet services to drive add-on sales beyond the Workstation. We continue to execute on our robust Pitch Creator pipeline. And within just seconds of launch, we now have 10 signed deals and over 45 opportunities with large banking clients in active trials and others in later stages of commercial negotiation.\nIn addition to Pitch Creator, our recently acquired LogoIntern solution is proving to be a valuable utility tool for clients and strengthens our position in banker automation. Together, these tools are creating greater workflow efficiencies, driving adoption, client conversations and closes.\nOutside of banking, PE/VC remains a bright spot with Q3 marking our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth driven by the strength of our private markets offering and Cobalt. Corporates also contributed meaningfully supported by strong tailwinds from our Irwin business, which drove increases in both ASV and seat count. Since the acquisition of Irwin earlier this year, nearly half of new corporates ASV has come from competitor displacements. This success validates our land-and-expand strategy using Investor Relations users as an entry point to deepen relationships within the office of the CFO.\nWithin the institutional buy side, we had several positive developments this quarter. We secured strategic wins for our front-office solutions and improved retention with our asset management clients. One example is a new IRN 2.0 deal with a major U.S. asset manager choosing us to replace their legacy research management system, thanks to our advanced dashboard and GenAI capabilities. Our managed services offering is also opening new growth channels as we replaced several incumbent vendors at a major asset manager who is now fully aligned with FactSet.\nHedge funds were another area of strength with growth accelerating due to new fund launches, greater adoption of the Workstation and data products and the positive impact of our recent street account price increases. We expect hedge fund demand to continue in fiscal 2025.\nAt the same time, we faced several headwinds. Reduced contribution from the annual price increase offset some of our gains. Additionally, as clients, especially asset owners, continue to optimize costs and streamline their vendor relationships, we are seeing more pressure in these areas. We are committed to leveraging our innovative solutions and client relationships to drive future growth.\nFor partnerships in CGS, growth continued in the third quarter driven by a significant real-time win and strength in the new issuance markets for CGS. New business and expansion activity remains strong across multiple partner types. Looking ahead, we expect this positive trajectory to continue into the fourth quarter.\nIn summary, I want to reiterate that our #1 priority is to drive top line growth. The breadth and quality of our opportunities give us visibility and confidence as we look ahead. We are well positioned to deliver in Q4 and meet our full year fiscal 2025 guidance. The majority of the pipeline for the remainder of the year is driven by the institutional buy side. As noted earlier, the demand for middle-office solutions, in particular, performance and managed services, is high as clients look for longer-term help as they upgrade their tech stack.\nOur innovation with using GenAI in our buy-side solutions is supporting strong client engagement and opportunities as well. Demand for our Data Solutions is expected to be a notable contributor to our Q4 results. The need for fundamental and estimates data remains high, in part driven by hedge funds and wealth. Engagement on real time and benchmarks has grown as clients look for modern technology, quality and stability, and these solutions represent more than 1/3 of the data opportunities.\nWealth remains our growth engine. Our success in displacing incumbents and expanding from the adviser desktop into adjacent areas, such as APIs, widgets and data feeds, is resulting in meaningful client demand. Our wealth pipeline is strong, spanning desktops and real-time data and a growing demand for more sophisticated PLC tools where FactSet has deep industry credibility, giving us greater confidence to extend our success both geographically and within the wealth home office.\nOur teams are capitalizing on FactSet's first-mover advantage in GenAI, executing our go-to-market strategy to deliver innovative solutions that streamline workflows and help clients unlock greater efficiencies. With the strong foundation we've built, we are well positioned to fulfill our mission of supercharging financial intelligence.\nI will now turn it over to Helen to take you through our third quarter performance and FY '25 guidance in more detail.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. We anticipated a better performance in the second half, and I'm pleased to report that the third quarter showed strength in both financial and operating results. As Phil mentioned, our pipeline is solid, positioning us well for continued ASP growth to finish out the year. Given this momentum, we are reaffirming our guidance for FY '25. I'll share more detail shortly, but let's first review the quarterly results.\nOrganic ASV grew by $22.6 million in the quarter, representing a 4.5% increase year-over-year. We successfully captured an additional $11 million in our annual price increase primarily in the EMEA and Asia Pac regions. This amount was lower than prior year, which reflects the anticipated headwind of lower CPI in our pricing.\nGAAP revenues increased 5.9% year-over-year, reaching $586 million. When we look at organic revenue, which excludes foreign exchange movements and impact from acquisitions or dispositions during the past 12 months, we saw a 4.4% increase, reaching $577 million. For our geographic segments, organic revenue grew by 5% in the Americas, 2% in EMEA and 6% in Asia Pacific.\nNow turning to expense. GAAP operating expenses, which include onetime nonrecurring items, increased 11.7% year-over-year to $391 million. This was primarily driven by both higher employee and technology expenses. On an adjusted basis, operating expense grew 10.6%. Employee expense increased 12% compared to the same quarter last year. This reflects our return to a normal bonus accrual and excludes a onetime payroll tax adjustment in the third quarter of the prior period. These 2 factors account for approximately 2/3 of the year-over-year change.\nOur workforce has grown by 2.6% year-over-year, strengthened by our strategic acquisitions of Irwin and LiquidityBook earlier this fiscal year. From Q2 to Q3, we have managed down our head count in our core business as we continue our disciplined approach of self-funding investment priorities through enhanced productivity and operational efficiency.\nTechnology-related expenses increased 21%, reflecting the higher amortization of internal-use software and our ongoing investment in generative AI capabilities. As previously communicated, we are strategically focusing our growth spend on technology to drive market leadership through product innovation. These costs now represent approximately 11% of revenue this quarter, up slightly from 10% from the same period a year ago.\nWe have managed the 2 remaining large spend categories effectively. Third-party content costs increased 1% year-over-year, now representing under 5% of revenue, about 20 basis points lower than the prior year. Our real estate and related facilities expense remained steady year-over-year at just under 3% of revenue, also 20 basis points lower as compared to last year. For a more detailed breakdown of our expense progression from revenue to adjusted operating income, I encourage you to reference the appendix in today's earnings presentation.\nMoving to our margin performance. Our GAAP operating margin was 33.2%, lower by 350 basis points compared to a year ago. Adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, a decrease of 270 basis points year-over-year. These figures reflect the normalization of our bonus accruals this year, the onetime favorable tax adjustment in the prior year and increased technology expense.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue was approximately 20 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis primarily due to increased compensation expense and professional fees related to our acquisitions. On an adjusted basis, excluding onetime items, our SG&A improved by about 15 basis points, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to operational efficiency. Our GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, an increase from 17% we saw in the same quarter last year, primarily reflecting lower excess tax benefits from our stock-based compensation.\nRegarding earnings per share, our GAAP diluted EPS was $3.87, a decrease of $0.22 or 5.4% versus $4.09 in the same period last year. Adjusted EPS decreased by $0.10 or 2.3% to $4.27. These results reflect our continued investment in the business, which drives our revenue growth.\nOur EBITDA was $236 million, a decrease of 1.7% compared to the prior year period, reflecting lower net income. Most notably, our free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations minus capital spending grew to $229 million in the third quarter, up 5% over the same period last year. This improvement was driven by stronger operating cash flows, highlighting the underlying financial strength of our business and our ability to increase cash generation even as we invest for future growth.\nTurning now to the use of capital for shareholder return. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 184,000 shares for around $81 million at an average share price of $438.45. At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had $106 million remaining under the $300 million share repurchase authorization our Board approved last September. Additionally, on June 17, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $400 million, which will become available on September 1, 2025.\nOn June 18, 2025, we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share to holders of record as of May 30, 2025. This represents a 6% increase from the previous quarter dividend and marks the 26th consecutive year of dividend increases on a stock split-adjusted basis. When we combine our dividends and share repurchases, we have returned $415 million to our shareholders over the past 12 months, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value.\nDuring the quarter, we refinanced the credit facility that was established 3 years ago for the CGS acquisition. Our new credit facility includes a $500 million funded term loan and $1 billion undrawn revolver, providing us with additional liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to support business growth. We continued our disciplined approach to debt management by repaying $62.5 million of term loan principal, consistent with our previous pace, and ended the quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 1.7x.\nFinally, the second half of fiscal 2025 is showing improved results with third quarter organic ASV growth accelerating as we successfully meet client demands. Our visibility into the pipeline gives us confidence in Q4 performance, and we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance. We are making targeted investments in our strategic priorities, focusing on differentiated products and internal efficiency initiatives. We anticipate Q4 to be the highest quarter for expense this fiscal year with investments concentrated on our GenAI and infrastructure projects alongside go-to-market initiatives that are already strengthening pipeline volume and quality.\nIn conclusion, we remain committed to driving ASV growth, maintaining operational focus and allocating capital wisely to enable FactSet to deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders.\nOn behalf of the executive leadership team, I would also like to extend my sincere gratitude to Phil for his leadership and contributions. While many of us know Phil for his love of impossibly spicy foods and his deep knowledge of '80s rock bands, his unwavering focus has always been on 2 things: his family and FactSet. On a personal note, I've learned much from his open leadership style and truly valued our partnership through both challenges and successes. And we are enthusiastic about welcoming Sanoke in September as he leads FactSet into its next chapter of success. Having been a FactSet client himself, he brings a unique perspective that will further help us enhance our client-first approach. On behalf of all Factsetters, we wish Phil only the best and look forward to having Sanoke on board.\nAnd with that, we are now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the FactSet Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yet He, with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYet He\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Second Fiscal Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions].\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most direct comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise noted, relative performance metrics reflect changes as compared to the respective fiscal 2024 period. Also, consistent with the last quarter, please note that starting fiscal 2025, FactSet is reporting organic ASV rather than organic ASV plus professional services to focus on the recurring nature of our revenues.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer; and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Yet, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I begin, let me start by welcoming Kevin Toomey as our new Head of Investor Relations, and thanking Yet for serving in the role on an interim basis maintaining strong investor engagement during the past 6 months, in addition to his role as Head of Corporate Development.\nKevin brings to FactSet over 2 decades of experience in Investor Relations, equity research and financial markets, and I look forward to working with him to continue growing our Investor Relations program.\nNow on to the results. In the second quarter, we grew organic ASV 4.1% year-over-year, delivering adjusted operating margin of 37.3% and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.28. We are encouraged by the positive momentum of deals progressing through the sales cycle this past quarter and have confidence that we are reaching an inflection point in ASV growth heading into the back half of the year.\nWe anticipated a slow start to fiscal 2025 and continue to operate in a challenging market environment. Lower CPI has resulted in a lower year-over-year annual price increase and softer results in asset management and banking masked significant progress we made developing and executing against our pipeline during the quarter.\nWhile acknowledging there remains market uncertainty, I'm pleased with the strength of our pipeline and the product-led innovation FactSet is bringing to the market. Our dialogue with clients continues to be constructive, positioning our business positively for the growth acceleration we anticipate in the second half of the year.\nWith increased visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming the 5% midpoint of our organic ASV growth guidance and narrowing the range of anticipated top line outcomes. Helen will cover the rest of our revised guidance in more detail later in her remarks.\nTurning back to the second quarter. ASV retention remained greater than 95% and client retention was 91%. We grew our client base to over 8,600 led by an increase in corporates wealth and partners and our user count increased to over 219,000, driven by our continued success in wealth.\nStarting with our performance by region. In the Americas, we grew organic ASV by 4%. Strength in wealth and hedge funds was offset by mixed results for asset managers, asset owners and partners, where a few large losses masked the benefit of strategic 7-figure wins.\nIn EMEA, organic ASV growth was 3%. We're continuing to see momentum with hedge funds and PE/VC firms in the region, but these gains were offset by erosion headwinds faced in the quarter. This trend was most notable in Asset Management and banking.\nIn Asia Pacific, we maintained 7% organic ASV growth driven by continued strong sales of data solutions, particularly among wealth, corporates, hedge funds and PE/VC farms.\nNow turning to our results from a firm type perspective. Wealth reaccelerated to double-digit growth in the quarter, lapping last year's large cancellation. We continue to gain market share with leading clients in wealth evidenced by UBS selecting FactSet to power their adviser desktops and client-facing portal in the Americas. This is another example of an enterprise deal where our digital and technology capabilities are winning in the market.\nOur differentiating wealth adviser solution and industry-leading client service were key to this success. Implementation and rollout are expected to occur throughout the remainder of the year. With this latest win, FactSet is now the primary market data partner to half of the world's top 20 wealth management firms, including 3 of the 4 U.S. wirehouses and 3 of the top 5 Canadian wealth managers.\nThe opportunity for our wealth business is global, and we are seeing traction with clients outside North America. As we execute against our sales pipeline, I'm confident there is continued runway to extend our success both geographically and beyond the adviser desktop into the wealth home office and adjacent workflows.\nWithin dealmakers, while banking was a drag to growth, we still saw renewal activity increased notably in the quarter. We signed more than a dozen large banking renewals, securing multiyear contracts on many of them to reinforce FactSet as a trusted partner and opening the opportunity for future upsells.\nWe are confident FactSet's focus on workflow efficiency and total cost of ownership is top of mind for many of our banking clients. We launched Pitch Creator midway through the quarter and already have a robust pipeline with more than 50 opportunities, almost 2 dozen of our largest banking clients actively trialing our products and several of our clients in the latest stages of commercial negotiation.\nPitch Creator and our recently acquired LogoIntern solution are extending FactSet's lead in powering junior bankers by streamlining their daily workload. Clients are telling us they welcome the practical workhorse approach FactSet is taking to boost the productivity of their junior employees who are increasingly asked to do more in the current environment.\nWe expect acceleration of our banking business in the second half of the year, notwithstanding the more cautious sentiment and macro uncertainty of recent weeks. Outside of banking, PE/VC remains a bright spot with accelerated double-digit growth in the second quarter. Corporates also added to growth fueled by the momentum from our Irwin acquisition in the first quarter.\nWithin the institutional buy side, headwinds from cost rationalization and budget tightening persisted among our asset manager and asset owner clients. While retention pressure growth, particularly among active asset managers facing AUM outflows, the impact in the second quarter included a 7-figure cancel due to our proactive retirements of a legacy and bespoke solution that we are no longer supporting.\nAs clients continue to cut costs and optimize headcount, our managed services offering is providing a natural hedge and an additional growth channel. We gained further momentum with a large 7-figure win displacing a legacy performance system with attached managed services to support the operational workflows of a leading asset management clients.\nHedge funds were also a bright spot in the second quarter as we capitalized on fund launches, higher workstation retention and strong data solution sales. During the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of LiquidityBook to enhance FactSet's ability to serve the integrated workflow needs of our clients across the entire portfolio life cycle adding LiquidityBook's technology forward OMS, free trade compliance and eyeball capabilities to our workstation enables us to more seamlessly link adjacent steps in the front office trade workflow. We are excited about the bidirectional cross-sell opportunities that we are already executing on and expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to FactSet's growth. partnerships in CGS growth in the second quarter remained solid.\nWe are seeing robust new business and expansion activity across multiple partner segments, particularly amongst index providers, exchanges and AI-focused fintechs. Similar to last quarter, CGS benefited from the continued strong new issuance market across several asset classes.\nIn summary, I want to reiterate that our #1 priority is to drive top line growth. As we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we have increasing visibility into a robust sales pipeline and positive underlying momentum. Wealth will continue to be a growth engine. Not only are we gaining market share and extending our track record of success displacing the incumbent in this market, but we are also widening the aperture on the breadth of workflows our solution is going to address.\nLeading clients are choosing FactSet to be their enterprise partner, and we continue to receive validating feedback that our products and service levels are positive differentiators versus the competition. There is ample runway for accretive growth across our smaller firm types. The acquisitions of Irwin and LiquidityBook in recent months are already driving cross-selling opportunities and pulling FactSet into higher volume shorter sales cycle opportunities with corporates and hedge funds where client purchase decisions are more rapid.\nAdditionally, Cobalt, which we acquired a few years ago, continues to open doors and position us to cross-sell PE/VC clients seeking enterprise solutions. Our banking products remain best-in-class, strengthened by content investments across private markets, deep sector and fundamental data. Our clients consistently provide positive feedback on the breadth and quality of our data that we feel is a competitive advantage.\nWe believe FactSet has the best banking product in the market, and we continue to extend this lead with our focus on workflow productivity. In the past 18 months, we renewed more than 1/3 of our banking ASV, representing over 40% of banking users, including more than half of our top 25 investment banking clients to multiyear contracts limiting downside risk in the second half of the year and positioning FactSet to grow wallet share with our expanded enterprise data and workflow productivity solutions.\nFor the institutional buy side, we are making steady progress driving client engagement at the enterprise level with a focus on improving their total cost of ownership. Managed services and our expanded data solutions offering are contributing to a healthy second half pipeline and lowering the risk of large client cancellations.\nOur teams are intensely focused on capitalizing on FactSet's early mover status on GenAI products, executing our go-to-market strategies across our new and differentiated solutions and mitigating the headwinds that pressured retention in the first half. We are well positioned to deliver on our mission to supercharge financial intelligence, and I am confident in our path forward.\nI'll now turn it over to Helen to take you through our second quarter and first half 2025 performance in more detail.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. Over the first 2 quarters of the fiscal year, we delivered solid financial and operating performance that sets us up for a strong second half, as we previously guided. We utilize our balance sheet to acquire central capabilities for our buy-side, corporate and banking workflows while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.\nAs Phil mentioned, we have a promising pipeline across all firm types which should boost ASV in the remainder of the fiscal year. As a result, we have updated our fiscal 2025 guidance by narrowing our organic ASV growth range to reflect our confidence in achieving the 5% midpoint. We are also reaffirming the ranges for adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS with our productivity and expense management efforts expected to absorb the dilution from recent acquisitions.\nMore detailed information to follow, but first, I will review our quarterly results. Organic ASV grew by $19.6 million in the quarter and 4.1% year-over-year. It is important to remember that our annual price increase partly depends on CPI, which has declined compared to last year, thus impacting the price increase for this fiscal year. We captured over $18 million in price increases, primarily in the Americas versus $25 million in the prior year, resulting in a nearly $7 million headwind to ASV growth this quarter.\nGAAP revenues increased 4.5% year-over-year to $571 million, while organic revenues, which exclude foreign exchange movements and impact from acquisitions or dispositions over the past 12 months, increased 4% to $568 million. For our geographic segment, organic revenues grew by 4% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA and 7% in Asia Pacific.\nGAAP operating expenses, which include onetime nonrecurring items, rose 5.8% year-over-year to $385 million. This increase resulted from higher acquisition-related professional fees and technology expenses, partly offset by lapping a onetime restructuring charge in the prior year. Due to these factors, GAAP operating margin decreased by approximately 80 basis points to 32.5% compared to last year's second quarter.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 6.3% and operating margin decreased 100 basis points year-over-year to 37.3%. This was primarily driven by a 31% increase in technology-related spend, due to higher cloud and software expenses and greater amortization of internal use software, reflecting our ongoing investment in generative AI.\nTechnology costs accounted for over 10% of revenue in the quarter, up from 8% in the prior year. Employee expenses increased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to last year's lower bonus accrual. Excluding this factor, our employee expenses would have been flat to down year-over-year.\nPeople expenses are our largest cost category, constituting 40% of revenue which is down nearly 60 basis points versus the prior year. By streamlining processes and utilizing automation, we continuously find ways to enhance workforce efficiency and maintain cost discipline while investing in strategic priorities.\nThird-party content costs rose 7% year-over-year but remain less than 5% of revenues, similar to the prior year's quarter. With increased data demand, we have actively managed this growth. For example, in the second quarter, we replaced several providers with our own self-collected data.\nWe not only reduced licensing fees, we pay third parties but also now offer superior content with full redistribution rights that align seamlessly with FactSet's proprietary identifiers. Real estate and related facilities expense decreased 6% year-over-year, staying under 3% of revenues, about 30 basis points lower than the prior year.\nPlease refer to the appendix for today's earnings presentation for a more detailed expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income. During the quarter, our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was higher year-over-year by approximately 50 basis points on a GAAP basis and more than 180 basis points on an adjusted basis, primarily due to higher technology expenses partially offset by lower compensation expense.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue was approximately 30 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis, primarily due to increased professional fees linked to acquisitions offset by reduced bad debt expense. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was about 75 basis points lower after excluding onetime nonrecurring items.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 15.9%, a decrease when compared to the 16.4% tax rate in the second quarter of last year. This change was mainly due to lower U.S. tax on foreign earnings, partially offset by discrete items like reduced tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.11 or 3% to $3.76 this quarter versus $3.65 in the same period last year, primarily due to higher revenue partially offset by an increase in acquisition-related professional fees and technology-related expenses.\nAdjusted EPS increased by $0.06 or 1.4% to $4.28. EBITDA for the quarter grew 3.6% compared to the prior year period to $225 million, driven by higher net income. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations minus capital spending, was $150 million in the second quarter, up 23% over the same period last year. This result was driven by positive working capital shifts due to decreased income tax payables and improved accounts receivable collections.\nTurning to return of capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased nearly 137,000 shares for approximately $64 million at an average share price of $470.70. At fiscal quarter end, we had a capacity of $187 million remaining under the $300 million share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors last September.\nToday, we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share to holders of record as of February 28, 2025. We remain diligent with our buyback program and are committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Combining dividends and share repurchases, we returned $392 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we paid off the remaining principal of the $1 billion term loan we took out for our CGS acquisition 3 years ago. We funded the recent LiquidityBook acquisition with new borrowings under our revolving credit facility with $480 million drawn at quarter end. Our gross leverage ratio was 1.7x, consistent with our aim to maintain investment-grade ratings.\nFinally, we remain confident in our second half top line acceleration and are reaffirming the 5% midpoint of our prior guidance on organic ASV growth. We are also narrowing our ASV growth range by adjusting both the top and bottom ends of the range by $10 million to $100 million to $130 million, reflecting a growth rate range of approximately 4.4% to 5.8%.\nOur guidance for revenue is now a range of $2.305 billion to $2.325 billion, a $20 million increase from our previous guidance. The change factors in the expected impact for the rest of the year from our recent acquisitions of Irwin in November, LiquidityBook in February and LogoIntern in early March. Based on our solid performance in conscientious cost management in the first half, we are maintaining our guidance range for adjusted operating margin at 36% to 37% and adjusted diluted EPS at $16.80 to $17.40.\nThis decision illustrates our ability to mitigate the modest margin and EPS dilution from the aggregate impact of our recent acquisitions. On a GAAP basis, we expect operating margin in the range of 32% to 33% and EPS to be between $14.80 to $15.40 for the year. This decrease from prior guidance of 50 basis points and $0.30, respectively, reflect onetime nonrecurring expenses incurred in connection with these acquisitions.\nThe guidance range for our effective tax rate remains unchanged between 17% to 18%. As Phil indicated, our teams are well equipped to deliver second half growth. We have clearer visibility into our pipeline strength based on our increased breadth of solutions and growing client interest in our GenAI solutions.\nWe will continue to leverage our expense base and invest smartly focusing on differentiated products and internal efficiencies. We anticipate higher expenses in the second half for planned GenAI and infrastructure projects alongside go-to-market initiatives to further boost pipeline volume and quality over the next 12 months.\nIn conclusion, we are prioritizing ASV growth, operational focus and strategic capital allocation. to enable FactSet to deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders.\nAnd with that, we are now ready for your questions.

Welcome to the FactSet First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yet He, Interim Head of Investor Relations.\n\nYet He\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's First Fiscal Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides to be referenced during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour.

I will now turn the discussion over to Phil.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Yet, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results. We're off to a good start in fiscal 2025 with solid operating performance, growing organic ASV 4.5% year-over-year, delivering adjusted operating margin of 37.6% and achieving adjusted diluted EPS of $4.37.\nWhile a backdrop of macro uncertainty and cost pressure faced by clients continues to persist, we saw momentum building during the first quarter. We remain cautious, but I'm encouraged by the constructive dialogue we are having with clients and the trends we are seeing in the pipeline.\nAs a reminder, the ASV we added in the first quarter is seasonally the lowest of the year. Given the timing of large deals, it is also important to look at half and full year performance as more holistic measures of our progress. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect ASV growth in fiscal 2025 will be second half-weighted.\nBefore turning to our financial results, I want to thank those of you that joined our Investor Day last month and for the positive feedback we received. For those that missed it, we discussed FactSet's strategy to supercharge financial intelligence and help clients as their trusted data and technology partner by delivering efficiency and innovation to their end-to-end workflows.\nThis strategic direction builds on our market-leading franchises across the firm types we serve and is underpinned by our technology evolution, investment priorities and product road map. There's still much to do, but we are confident in our ability to execute and achieve the medium-term targets we shared with you at Investor Day.\nDemand for our solutions remained steady with ASV retention over 95% and client retention at 91%. During the first quarter, we grew our client base to almost 8,250. And our continued expansion within wealth drove our user count to over 218,000.\nTurning now to our organic ASV performance by region. In the Americas, we grew 5% as we lapped a significant wealth win in Q1 last year. New business accelerated in the quarter across wealth, hedge funds and asset owners. And improved retention across asset managers was overshadowed by softness in areas where clients are reprioritizing budgets.\nIn EMEA, we experienced 4% growth driven by wins in partnerships and asset owners with additional contribution from PE/VC, hedge funds and overall improved retention in the region. And in Asia Pacific, we maintained 7% growth. Improved seasonal hiring and banking relative to last year was a driver, particularly among global bulge bracket banks. Data solution wins with partners were offset by lower retention with asset manager clients.\nFrom a firm-type perspective, our results were mixed. After a very strong Q4 to close the year, wealth organic ASV growth was more subdued in the first quarter. Seat count continues to increase at a strong clip, sequentially adding over 2,000 users driven by marquee accounts.\nWe also continue to add smaller wealth management clients this quarter. It's difficult to control the timing of when large deals close, but we remain confident that deceleration this quarter is temporary.\nAnd within wealth, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of 7-figure opportunities with potential to upsell existing clients and expanding solution set, giving us conviction that growth will reaccelerate over the next several quarters.\nIn dealmakers, growth was in line with last quarter. Banking seasonal hiring continues to normalize, but remains a drag to growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect several new products will add to the acceleration of our banking business in the second half of the year. Most notably, our gen AI-powered Pitch Creator offering is already seeing traction in our client conversations with 2 wins in Q1 ahead of our formal launch in early calendar 2025.\nOutside of banking, we saw continued acceleration in PE/VC to double-digit growth led by several competitor displacements and strength in Cobalt, our modern portfolio monitoring tool. Adding to corporates, we closed the acquisition of Irwin in early November to expand FactSet's ability to address the integrated workflow needs of IR professionals with an integrated modern solution. We have a strong pipeline and have already seen increased inbound interest from Investor Relations users since the acquisition was announced.\nFor the institutional buy side, we maintained growth consistent with last quarter. The highlight for the quarter is a landmark 7-figure performance solutions win, where we beat our competitor and displaced key incumbents at a global outsourced CIO provider seeking to overhaul their technology stack and solutions across the portfolio life cycle.\nThis wide-ranging enterprise deal includes our portfolio analytics, multi-asset class capabilities and performance reporting solutions. This win also underscores FactSet's ability to effectively partner with clients using our managed services offering to deliver workflow efficiencies and an improved operating model.\nWithin asset management, we continue to see erosion pressure as clients scrutinize their budgets and pursue vendor consolidation, particularly with small and midsized firms where it is more difficult to reach scale efficiencies. Our recently announced partnership with JPMorgan Securities Services seeks to address this total cost of ownership challenge by coupling FactSet's performance reporting and portfolio analytics solutions with accounting and investment book of records through JPMorgan's fusion data management platform.\nThe partnerships in CGS growth was solid. Improved retention and an increase in larger wins with partners contributed to accelerating growth. CGS continues to perform well, buoyed by the strong issuance market and content expansion.\nAs we execute against the strategy we outlined at Investor Day, clients are increasingly viewing FactSet as an innovation partner that can help them gain greater insights, drive lower cost of operations and elevate productivity so they can focus on high-value work. We are leveraging our industry-leading data and technology to responsibly harness the power of gen AI to bring more speed, accuracy and efficiency to our clients.\nBuilding on the AI Blueprint we announced last year, we recently unveiled our Intelligent Platform initiative, which integrates conversational AI at the platform level to enable next-generation search intelligence. This latest innovation in our series of new product developments leverages FactSet Mercury, our conversational knowledge engine, to provide actionable and auditable insights across our extensive content refinery of structured and unstructured data assets.\nWe hear loud and clear from our clients that they are not interested in marketing hype and promises of the future. They are demanding practical workhorse solutions to boost productivity, unlock efficiencies and optimize daily workflows. We will be launching new workflow solutions throughout the year that will add to our rapidly evolving gen AI capabilities and product set.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with the start to this year. It's worth reiterating that similar to last year, we expect growth to be weighted towards the back half of the year.\nAs we head into the start of calendar 2025, I'm encouraged by early signs of momentum picking up as clients reset budgets in what many are anticipating as an improved macro backdrop. There's budding confidence that the operating environment may improve as we progress through the year.\nA few examples of green shoots this quarter include greater client engagement in banking, strength in data solution sales to hedge runs and greater pace of competitor displacements in PE/VC, to name a few. We have a robust pipeline, greater visibility on some larger opportunities and many new innovative products that resonate with clients. I'm confident in our path forward. As such, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2025 guidance.\nI will now turn it over to Helen to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. It is great to be back with you all again. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we began our fiscal 2025 with solid operating performance and an uncertain but constructive market environment.\nQ1 organic ASV increased $3.4 million or 4.5% growth in a quarter that is seasonally our lowest. Also, a reminder that starting this quarter, we are no longer reporting professional services in our ASV in order to better reflect the recurring nature of our revenues. On this new basis of reporting, the comparable ASV for the prior year is provided in this morning's press release.\nFor the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 4.9% to $569 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from both acquisitions or dispositions over the past 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 4.7% to $568 million, driven by sales to wealth firms, asset owners and institutional asset managers. For our geographic segment, organic revenue grew by 5% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA and 6% in Asia Pacific.\nTurning now to expense. GAAP operating expenses increased 6.8% year-over-year to $377 million, driven by the amortization of intangible assets, compensation-related expenses and professional fees. This captures certain onetime nonrecurring items, including acquisition-related costs.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expense grew 4.9% at the same rate as revenue. Technology spend was the primary expense driver, which increased 18% year-over-year, largely due to higher amortization of internal software and our continued investment in generative AI.\nAs outlined at Investor Day, we are committed to investing in products and technology to maintain the market leadership needed to drive sustained and future growth. For the quarter, technology costs were just under 10% of revenue compared to 9% last year.\nEmployee expenses increased approximately 2% versus the prior year as we held our headcount largely flat. People-related costs remain our largest expense category at 39% of revenue, down 130 basis points year-over-year. We continue to exercise operational discipline to self-fund investments in our strategic priorities through more efficient operations and increased productivity.\nThird-party content costs increased 4% year-over-year and remain less than 5% of revenue. [indiscernible] and related facilities expense decreased 4% year-over-year. These expenses are now less than 3% of revenue, approximately 30 basis points lower compared to the prior year. For a more detailed walk from revenue to adjusted operating income, please refer to the appendix in today's earnings presentation.\nCompared to the previous Q1, GAAP operating margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points to 33.6%, largely due to onetime items. On an adjusted basis, operating margin was flat year-over-year at 37.6%.\nIn the quarter, our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was lower year-over-year by approximately 90 basis points on a GAAP basis and just under 70 basis points on an adjusted basis, primarily due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue was approximately 210 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis, primarily due to people expense and an increase in professional fees. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 70 basis points higher than prior year.\nTurning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 16.5%. This was an increase compared to the 15.2% tax rate in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the revaluation of a foreign deferred tax asset associated with the tax rate change.\nOur GAAP diluted EPS increased 1.3% to $3.89 this quarter versus $3.84 in the prior year period, driven by higher revenue, offset by margin compression and a higher tax rate. Given these same factors, adjusted EPS increased by $0.25 or 6.1% to $4.37.\nEBITDA increased 5% to $230 million compared to the same period last year, driven by higher net income and higher add-back items. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, decreased 56% year-over-year to $60 million in Q1. This was largely due to the resolution of a sales tax dispute, timing of vendor payments and higher capital expenditures during the quarter.\nAs we discussed at our Investor Day, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and are committed to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of stock buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased more than 104,000 shares for approximately $49 million at an average share price of $467. At the end of the quarter, we had $251 million of capacity remaining under the $300 million share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors back in September. Today, we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share to holders of record as of November 29, 2024.\nAlso in the first quarter, we reduced our term loan principal by another $62.5 million, lowering our gross leverage ratio to 1.5x. We expect the term loan to be repaid in full by the end of Q2. Our capital allocation remains consistent with our commitment to maintain investment-grade metrics.\nAnd finally, as you heard from Phil, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance. While there's still some variability around client budgets, we've observed encouraging signs with increased engagement and a growing willingness to make purchasing decisions.\nIn the final weeks of Q1, we've experienced positive momentum, which we are determined to maintain in order to achieve our full year objectives. We are actively taking steps in pricing and packaging to enhance our competitiveness against incumbent providers such as with hedge funds and PE/VC firms. These actions have resulted in higher new business. And with multiple pilots currently being tested, we are looking to replicate the success across various firm types in different markets globally.\nOur sales pipeline is healthy. And we continue to witness promising demand for our new gen AI products and enterprise solutions, setting the stage for this year to be another story of 2 distinct halves.\nIn conclusion, we remain confident in FactSet's ability to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value. By harnessing the power of our data and technology investments, we are poised to enhance our clients' financial insight and workflow significantly.\nAnd with that, we are now ready for your questions.

Welcome to the third quarter FactSet Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ali [indiscernible], Head of IR, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Third Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to 1 question. You may reenter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take as time permits.\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I speak about this quarter's results, I just want to point out that we schedule today's call on a Friday to allow for observance of the June team holiday earlier this week. We finished our third quarter with organic ASV and professional services growth of 5%. Adjusted diluted EPS rose to $4.37 for the quarter, and our adjusted operating margin was 39.4%. This quarter, we continued to see the impact of clients tightened budgets and cost rationalization, trends we highlighted last quarter that were echoed by others in the industry.\nThese pressures extend decision-making and lengthen sales cycles, Also, as you may recall, the third quarter is seasonally our weakest of the year. Against this backdrop, we continue to build on FactSet's history of 44 consecutive years of revenue growth and 28 consecutive years of adjusted EPS growth. And in these 44 years, we have successfully navigated through even more difficult market conditions than we face right now. Despite challenged end markets, this is an exciting time in our industry, particularly for technology companies with valuable data assets. We are harnessing the power of GenAI to build cutting-edge solutions and capture market share.\nFor example, we held our 11th client symposium in Miami in April, showcasing new products and the value they bring to clients. These new products are driving requests for hundreds of product demonstrations creating new leads for our sales team. Returning now to our third quarter. We concluded with 8,029 clients and 9 net new logos. Our user count exceeded 208,000. Overall, ASV retention remained higher than 95% and client retention was 90%. Currently, we expect to finish the fiscal year with annual organic ASV plus professional services growth between 4% and and 5.5%.\nLinda will provide further updates to guidance in a few minutes. Turning now to our performance by region. We saw slower growth in the third quarter due to continued market headwinds and the effect of the cancellation from the Credit Suisse UBS merger, which impacted all of our regions. Overall, this cancellation accounted for approximately 30 basis points or 2/3 of of our ASV deceleration quarter-over-quarter. In the Americas, gains from asset owners and wealth managers were offset by continued client cost rationalization and the Americas region's organic ASV growth rate was 5.7%.\nIn the EMEA region, growth was driven by a price increase, sales to asset owners and higher ASP from the analytics product suite. The EMEA region's organic ASV growth rate was 4.4%, and in the Asia Pacific region, we saw acceleration from buy-side firms driven by front office solutions and growing transactional revenues. The Asia Pacific region's organic ASV growth rate was 6.1%. Looking now at trends by fund types. On the institutional buy side, we had a notable win this quarter displacing a competitor at a large asset manager in the U.S. This win was driven by our advanced fixed income analytics.\nWe took an enterprise sales approach and the client chose our portfolio performance solutions and analytics capabilities. We had another significant win with a global asset manager. It moved to a multiyear agreement, including middle office portfolio services. This contract aligns with the client strategy to consolidate vendors and to reduce total cost of ownership. These victories demonstrate our ability to provide tailored high-value solutions to our clients. These clients also recognize that our ongoing management of their complex portfolio holdings positioned us well to do more for them. In banking, we saw a decline from the Credit Suisse cancellation. This segment is still impacted by cautious hiring and a wait-and-see attitude toward overall capital market conditions.\nIn Wealth Management, although growth was modest this quarter, the sector remains a tremendous opportunity for FactSet given our active pipeline. We're committed to enhancing our offerings to capture future growth and deliver compelling value to wealth advisers, and their clients. A great example of this is our recent investment in a identified, which was announced last week by incorporating a identified relationship management data into FactSet's intelligent prospecting solution, we're able to accelerate new client acquisitions for wealth advisers.\nThis brings us to the fast evolving technology landscape where FactSet is well positioned to lead. We have more than 40 years of meticulously curated and connected data. We are trusted by institutional asset managers and retail wealth advisers with 16 million portfolios on our system, representing more than $30 trillion in assets. And on the sell side, FactSet is well established as the platform of choice for fundamental research workflows. For users on both the buy side and the sell side, FactSet has a unique breadth of data curated for their specific use cases. Our rich data ecosystem is a singularly robust and safe foundation for harnessing the power of generative AI. Specifically, our clients benefit from the combination of our data, our knowledge of clients' workflows and our new generative AI tools.\nTogether, they are producing unique insights and efficiencies for our clients. At FactSet, we are energized to help our clients find new ways to surface insights to set them apart from their peers. We're doing this with live demonstrations of our new products that are available right now. As a result, FactSet is the trusted partner of choice, given that accuracy requires both seasoned judgment and traceable data sources. At FactSet, we have both. A prime example is our portfolio commentary product released last month, which generates complete detailed investment performance summaries in about a minute.\nPortfolio commentary combines our comprehensive data and deep domain expertise to provide tailored and highly efficient outputs. We also launched the new portfolio manager hub, an end-to-end solution that integrates all elements of our portfolio managers workflow from news and research to analysis and trade simulation. PM Hub adds a GenAI backed chatbot called portfolio assistant to tap into our data to provide precise traceable answers all without leaving the platform. Enthusiastic client response to portfolio commentary and PM Hub give us confidence that we can extend our buy-side middle office presence to front office users.\nAnd on the sell side, FactSet Mercury optimizes the company research workflow for junior bankers using a single trusted conversational interface, we are working towards producing pitchbooks and charts on demand. We expect users to save another 10 hours per week using this tool in addition to the 5 to 10 hours per week that they said they saved with FactSet before we release Mercury. As banking conditions improve, we are confident that bankers will seek out FactSet Mercury to give them better speed, accuracy and efficiency.\nLooking ahead, we have a multiyear strategic investment plan built on 3 key pillars: First, we are expanding our market data for deep sector, private markets, alternatives and real-time applications. With real-time market data, for example, we aim to compete for market share by transitioning to cloud-based solutions. By enhancing our [indiscernible] cloud capabilities and expanding content coverage, we can offer more scalable, reliable and cost-efficient data services. We're well positioned to capture market share when clients demand modern cloud-based infrastructure. Secondly, client workflow. Beyond our middle office business, we are heavily investing in our [indiscernible] office capabilities, covering both fundamental and quantitative research.\nOur offerings for the sell side particularly in banking automation, are gaining traction with top global banks and boutique firms. Our wealth franchise also continues to grow with significant new opportunities in the pipeline. Thirdly, generative AI, this foundational strategic initiative, we believe will begin delivering incremental ASV in fiscal 2025. As we mentioned, our new portfolio commentary in FactSet Mercury are already driving demand. And last week, we announced our off-platform AI solutions for technologists. These include a new generative AI data package, a conversational API, powered by FactSet Mercury and a new AI partner program to bring fintechs and AI start-ups on to FactSet's platform. Together, we expect to see ASV growth from tech savvy financial firms and hedge funds.\nIn summary, I am extremely excited about our competitive opportunity as demand for traceable quality data grows, particularly for financial decision-making, we are adding critical AI tools to deliver real advantages for our clients. Our partnership focused approach has made FactSet a preferred provider and positions us well for even greater success when market conditions improve. I will now hand it over to Linda to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nIncoming Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, despite slower ASV growth in the third quarter, we improved margins and EPS, and we are increasing guidance on both of these for the fiscal year. I'll say more about that later. First, our results for this quarter. As Ali noted, our usual reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. For the third quarter, organic ASV grew 5%, while adjusted operating margin improved 340 basis points to 39.4% and adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% to $4.37. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 4% to $553 million on sales to institutional asset managers, asset owners, partners and corporates. For our geographic segments, organic revenues grew by 5.5% in the Americas, 2.4% in EMEA and 3% in Asia Pacific. .\nTurning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses decreased 2% year-over-year to $350 million. This was driven by lower compensation expense, mainly due to a reduction of $8 million to our annual bonus accrual as well as reduction in salary expenses and payroll taxes, partially offset by higher intangible amortization and cloud-related costs. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 420 basis points to 36.6%. This was due to increased revenues combined with reduced operating expenses as a result of lower compensation expense.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expenses decreased 1.2%. And now looking at each of our 4 major cost buckets in turn. First, as we have frequently discussed, technology continues to be our main area of expense growth. Specifically, technology costs increased 26% year-over-year. Technology costs now represent about 9.5% of revenue. Secondly, in contrast, employee expenses fell 8.6% year-over-year driven by lower compensation expenses due to earlier cost reduction efforts and the lower bonus accrual.\nThird, our third-party content costs increased by 9% due to the timing of changes in variable fee expenses. And finally, real estate and related expenses saw a 14% decrease year-over-year as we saw the benefits of early and significant steps we took to reduce this expense bucket. As we've mentioned before, total expense management is positioning the company for future growth while allowing us to continue to invest in technology and strategic initiatives.\nTurning now to margin. Adjusted operating margin improved by 340 basis points to 39.4%. This was primarily due to an adjustment to the bonus accrual, a onetime payroll tax adjustment and lower salary expense. The bonus accrual was reduced by about $8 million for the fiscal year, given our lower ASV achievement. This change added about 160 basis points to our adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Additionally, earlier cost rationalization efforts resulted in another 130 basis points of the 340 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement. And as always, you will find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of services declined by 90 basis points year-over-year on a GAAP basis. Cost of services was approximately 40 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in intangible amortization and cloud-related costs. And in SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, it was 320 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis. SG&A was approximately 300 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense, a reduction in bad debt expense and lower facilities costs.\nTurning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17% compared to last year's rate of 16.9%. This slight increase was primarily due to higher pretax income, partially offset by increased utilization of foreign tax credits and additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Turning now to EPS. [indiscernible] EPS increased 18.2% to $4.09 this quarter versus $3.46 in the prior year period. This was driven by higher revenues, margin expansion and a lower share count partially offset by higher interest expense.\nOn an adjusted basis, EPS increased 15.3% to $4.37, also driven by revenue growth and margin expansion as well as reduced share count partially offset by higher interest expense. EBITDA increased to $240 million, up 16.9% year-over-year due to higher net income. Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $217 million for the quarter, an increase of 13% over the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net cash from operating activities and reduced spend on property, equipment and leasehold improvements.\nFactSet continues to be a strong producer of free cash flow. And turning now to share repurchases for the quarter. We repurchased 135,150 shares for approximately $60 million at an average share price of $442.12. Our fiscal 2024 share repurchase plan targets $250 million of repurchases. As of May 31, 2024, we had $128.1 million remaining for repurchases in fiscal 2024. Also, yesterday, we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share which represented a 6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from the previous quarter. This marks the 25th consecutive year we have increased dividends on a stock split adjusted basis. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.\nCombining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $430.1 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months. And during the third quarter, we paid down $62.5 million of our term loan, which brings our gross leverage down to 1.7x. This is consistent with our plan to repay the term loan in full by the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As Phil mentioned earlier, given the delayed recovery in our end markets, we are now guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services growth of $85 million to $120 million for the fiscal year, reflecting 4.8% growth at the midpoint, down from our recent guide to approximately 5%.\nRevenues are now expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion for the year. On the other hand, our expectations for margin and EPS growth for the year have gone up. Specifically, GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.7% to 34%, up approximately 100 basis points from prior guidance. And adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37% to 37.5%, up 70 to 80 basis points from prior guidance. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be $0.40 higher than prior guidance in the range of $16 to $16.40. The effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged in the range of 16.5% on to 17.5%. In closing, we continue to manage our cost base carefully so that we can deliver value to our shareholders while maintaining investment in Gen AI and other strategic initiatives. We believe that we are well positioned for growth as the markets pick up. We're now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to FactSet's Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ali Van Nes. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandra van Nes\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.4% year-over-year, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $4.22 and an adjusted operating margin of 38.3%.\nGiven challenging industry factors and continued market uncertainty, our results this quarter were mixed. You may recall that we anticipated the softer top line growth from our December call.\nWe ended this quarter with more than 8,000 clients, adding 75 net new logos. And our user count was 206,478, down 605 in the quarter mostly due to consolidation following UBS' acquisition of Credit Suisse. In addition, please note that the ASV reduction impact of Credit Suisse is not reflected in our second quarter results. While we cannot share details about ongoing business discussions, our full year guidance continues to assume a conservative view of the Credit Suisse reduction as we indicated last quarter.\nOverall, ASV retention remained greater than 95%, and client retention was 90%. In terms of market conditions, client caution continued to delay purchasing decisions. We saw increased pressure on client headcount as they seek further efficiency gains. As a result, we saw a higher erosion this quarter.\nWe had fewer large deals in Q2 and saw a lower impact from our price increase, both of which contributed to a slower growth rate. However, industry cost cutting appears to be stabilizing, and we are starting to see pockets of recovery.\nAs we signaled in our December call, anticipation of softer top line growth drove our own difficult but necessary cost cuts, including headcount reductions during the quarter. Continued careful expense management will allow us to maintain margins and EPS growth along with investment in new products to drive future performance. Currently, we expect to finish the fiscal year at the lower end of our ASV growth guidance range of 5% to 7%.\nTurning now to our performance by region. Americas ASV growth decelerated by 200 basis points from the prior quarter to 5.9% mainly due to a large wealth cancellation as well as banking erosion and lower price realization. The wealth cancellation resulted from a client decision to move a custom nonstandard workflow solution in-house, following a change in its business strategy.\nIn EMEA, ASV growth decelerated 40 basis points to 5% mainly due to headwinds from lighter institutional asset management renewals, partially offset by new business acceleration. In Asia Pacific, ASV growth decelerated 240 basis points to 5.6%. Softer banking expansion, coupled with larger institutional asset manager loss, offset wins with asset owners. While new business accelerated modestly across regions, it was offset by greater reductions in both retention and expansion.\nOn the institutional buy side, we saw headwinds across all firm types due to cost-cutting and continued headcount reduction. For example, in 2023, passive funds surpassed active funds in total assets under management. As a result, our institutional asset management clients are seeing continued increased fee pressure. To help offset this pressure, we have expanded our capabilities to address users' needs, including in the front office.\nOur managed services business is growing as our clients outsource more of their middle office workflows to FactSet. This helped drive some gains with asset owners. We have invested in our platform to reduce clients' total cost of ownership or TCO. Given our ability to help clients do more with less, they are increasing their reliance on us despite fee pressure. As a result, we are investing in managed services, given our growth in this area.\nWe are leveraging our strength in the middle office to further power front office solutions. This quarter, we displaced a front office incumbent in asset management in Asia. And we did this by connecting the client's entire workflow, including both OMS and EMS capabilities. We also won that business on the strength of our open platform.\nSimultaneously, we are developing gen AI enhanced tools and copilots for portfolio managers and fundamental research analysts, which we believe will significantly reduce their time to insight. In dealmakers, we saw a higher erosion in banking and lower retention in private equity and venture capital. However, corporates are starting to see good momentum with Investor Relations users.\nAt the same time, expectations are high around the effect generative AI will have on our industry. Initial client feedback has been extremely positive on our new gen AI solutions, including FactSet Mercury, a conversational way to generate answers and insights from documents and structured data sets that is in beta release as part of our FactSet Explorer program. We see early signs that large language models, working with our deep repository of well curated data in our open platform, can power accelerated workflows for our clients. While we foresee that this trend will drive future growth, these initiatives need time to gain commercial momentum.\nIn banking, our gen AI banker efficiency tools are gaining users. We had more than 200 gen AI meetings with our banking clients in Q2. Beta products and testing with clients include [indiscernible] and investment banking office refresh API, which allows clients to automate cloud model updates. This is our first client-facing off-platform solution for banker automation, and we believe it can drive a new revenue stream.\nFinally, Transcript Assistant, our gen AI-powered chatbox, is in full release as announced last week. Transcript Assistant accelerates analysis of earnings call transcripts with a conversational interactive interface. Clients have the freedom to ask their own custom questions or choose from a FactSet-provided prompt.\nUser uptake has been strong. We are now expanding event coverage and comparative analysis in parallel with the FactSet Mercury integration. You can read more about Transcript Assistant in our press release from last week.\nTurning to wealth. Activity was more subdued this quarter, given one large cancellation and no large deals. However, wealth partnerships are creating stronger connections with portfolio and business development workflows, in turn, increasing senior executive level of client engagement.\nWe have recently driven major changes in the organization to position ourselves for future growth, including moving to our firm type focus and reducing costs. Given this rapid pace of change, I am extremely proud of how the company has risen to the occasion. This change process may have been challenging in the short run but has positioned us well for a market upturn.\nFinally, I want to highlight our FOCUS client event in Miami at the end of April. This event brings together top thought leaders, industry expert and key decision makers from the finance and tech sectors. Our theme for 2024 is the revolution of an ecosystem, discussing the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Attendees can expect a thoughtfully curated agenda with inspiring speakers, educational sessions and opportunities for meaningful connections. Registration information can be found at focus.factset.com.\nI'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nIncoming Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, despite slower ASV growth, we improved margins and EPS in the second quarter. Second quarter organic ASV grew 5.4%, while adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 38.3% and adjusted diluted EPS rose 11% to $4.22.\nI'll now share some additional details on our fiscal second quarter performance. As Ali noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release.\nFor the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 6% to $546 million on sales to asset owners, corporates, hedge funds and private equity and venture capital clients. For our geographic segment, organic revenues grew by 6.5% in the Americas, 4.8% in EMEA and 6.4% in Asia Pacific.\nTurning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year to $364 million. This was driven by higher employee expense, net of a $7 million decrease to our bonus accrual as well as by increased intangible asset amortization. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin increased by nearly 50 basis points to 33%. This was due to increased revenues, partially offset by higher personnel expenses, including an approximately $11 million restructuring charge. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 4%.\nLooking at each of our 4 major cost buckets in turn. As we frequently discussed, technology continues to be our main area of expense growth. Specifically, technology costs increased 11% year-over-year. Technology costs now represent about 8.4% of revenue, consistent with our medium-term outlook.\nIn contrast, employee expenses grew only 1% year-over-year driven by increased compensation expenses, partially offset by the lower bonus accrual. This small increase reflects some of the cost reduction efforts we took during the second quarter.\nNext, our third-party content costs increased 3% due to higher variable fee expenses. And finally, real estate expenses saw an 8% decrease year-over-year as we took early and significant steps to reduce this expense bucket.\nWe believe we have now rightsized our real estate footprint. As we have mentioned before, thoughtful expense management is positioning the company for future growth while allowing us to continue to invest in technology and strategic initiatives.\nTurning now to margin. Adjusted operating margin improved by 130 basis points to 38.3%. This was due to lower personnel expenses, given the lower bonus accruals and higher capitalization benefit, partially offset by higher technology expenses and higher bad debt expense. As always, you'll find an expense block from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was flat year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 90 points lower on an adjusted basis. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 40 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis. The decrease was due to revenues outpacing the increase in SG&A expenses and lower compensation costs, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. SG&A was about 40 basis points lower on an adjusted basis.\nTurning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.4% compared to last year's rate of 16.1%. This increase was due to higher taxable income, offset by higher stock option exercises and higher foreign credits, which reduced the tax rate.\nTurning now to EPS. GAAP EPS increased 8% to $3.65 this quarter versus $3.38 in the prior year period. This was driven by higher revenues and margin expansion, partly offset by a higher tax rate. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 11.1% to $4.22 also driven by revenue growth and margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $218 million, up 9.2% year-over-year due to higher net income driven primarily by an increase in operating income, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization and the impact of nonrecurring noncash expenses.\nFree cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $122 million for the quarter, a decrease of 17% over the same period last year. This was due to the timing of remitted payroll taxes related to employee stock compensation and higher income taxes payable, which are seasonally higher in the second quarter.\nTurning to share repurchases. For the quarter, we repurchased 113,050 shares for $52.3 million at an average share price of $462.23. Our fiscal 2024 share repurchase plan targets $250 million of repurchases. We have $188 million remaining for repurchases in the second half of fiscal 2024.\nWe remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $434.1 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months.\nAnd regarding leverage during the second quarter, we paid down $62.5 million of our outstanding term loan, which brings our gross leverage down to 1.8x. This is consistent with our plan to repay that term loan in full by the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nFinally, as Phil mentioned, we've carefully managed our cost base while continuing to invest in gen AI and other strategic initiatives. We believe that we are well positioned for growth as the markets pick up.\nWe are now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the FactSet Q1 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ali Van Nes, SVP IR. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandra van Nes\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's First Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com and are currently available on our website. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may reenter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nAdditionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer; and Kristy Karnovsky, Chief Product Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 7.1% year-over-year, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $4.12 and an adjusted operating margin of 37.6%.\nThis quarter, we closed 2 marquee deals that serve as proof points for our long-term strategy even as macro conditions remain challenging. The first was a large wealth win at a major U.S. firm where we displaced a competitor. As a result of this deal, our user count increased by more than 17,000 seats. The second was a significant trading win at one of the largest U.S. asset managers, highlighting the strength of our open platform and portfolio life cycle solutions.\nWe ended this quarter with almost 8,000 clients and 24 net new logos. ASV retention remained greater than 95%, and client retention was 90%. Nevertheless, since our last earnings call in September, sales cycles have continued to lengthen challenging our near-term forecast. Client budgets remained restricted due to lower deal-making volume layoffs and geopolitical uncertainty. So while the recent Federal Reserve commentary may be positive for the macro environment, we are revising our fiscal 2024 top line guidance to reflect ASV growth of $110 million to $150 million or 6% growth at the midpoint.\nWe will also be implementing a cost reduction program in the second quarter of FY '24. This program will support our investments in multiyear initiatives such as deep sector and real time and allow us to accelerate our AI strategic investments. We expect to review variable costs and personnel-related costs with the goal of delivering adjusted operating margin within our original guidance range of 36.3% to 36.7%. Linda will say more about this later in the call.\nTurning now to our performance by region. Growth this quarter was driven mainly by the large wealth win in the Americas as well as solid demand for Data Solutions, offsetting weaker results in other parts of the business. Americas' ASV growth accelerated 88 basis points over the prior quarter to 7.9%, where outside of wealth, lower net hiring and banking and asset managers led to softer demand for workstations compared with a year ago.\nIn EMEA, organic ASV growth decelerated to 5.4%, mainly due to a slowdown in our core buy-side markets in the U.K. and France. Our clients are experiencing reduced revenues and margin pressures, which led to delays in planned projects and slower sales cycle. Higher demand for Data Solutions partially offset these headwinds.\nIn Asia Pac, we delivered organic ASV growth of 8%, driven by solid gains with asset owners, partially offset by seasonal banking layoffs. From a firm type perspective, wealth accelerated the most compared with last quarter due to the marquee deal I mentioned earlier. While pipeline visibility remains limited until the broader market recovers the momentum, ongoing C-suite conversations at several firms point to continued opportunity to displace wealth competitors.\nFor dealmakers, we added new logos in private equity and corporate but not at the rate we saw last year. Churn and lower seasonal hiring led to erosion in banking. On the institutional buy side, cost cutting and headcount reductions at institutional asset managers caused a deceleration in workstation sales. For asset owners and hedge funds, elongated sales cycles further dampened results.\nFinally, new business and sales of Data Solutions drove growth with partners across regions. Overall, retention was flat in the first quarter with the positive effect of the fiscal 2023 price increase, partially offset by higher cancels and erosion. Over FactSet's 45-year history, new product releases have driven our strong market position. These included universal screening in 1986, portfolio analytics in 1995 and FactSet Fundamentals in 2008.\nLast week, we added to this list with the beta release of FactSet Mercury, our new conversational AI interface. FactSet Mercury is a large language model-based knowledge agent. It uses natural language to request company information, provide supporting context and also suggest next steps. Users can also ask for any chat using natural language, which is then prepared and delivered into Microsoft Office.\nFactSet Mercury is part of FactSet Explorer, a product preview program. We are working on Explorer with our leading banking clients and will soon offer it to institutional buy side and wealth clients. Also, last quarter, we released AI-enhanced transcript highlights and new summaries, which received positive reviews from our users. These are just the first of many workflows that will use generative AI to improve our clients' efficiency.\nAnd along with these AI initiatives, work continues on deep sector and real time, the wealth workstation and the portfolio life cycle. Each of these multiyear investments is driving growth, including last quarter's big wins in banking and asset management. Finally, the private credit market is growing fast and is almost the size of the leveraged loan market. It is well served by both our Data Solutions and our middle office analytics.\nFor example, Cobalt can be used for private credit fund portfolio monitoring. We can also extend our fixed income capabilities to private credit risk assessments, benchmarking and performance monitoring. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and the health of our business, and I am optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. Demand for our high-value products remain strong, demonstrated by our marquee wins this quarter and increased interest from global firms consolidating to FactSet's open platform.\nI'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nIncoming Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, Q1 organic ASV and revenue growth exceeded 7%. I will now share additional details on our fiscal first quarter performance. As Ali noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics compared to GAAP is included at the end of our press release. First, a few observations on macro conditions.\nLast Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to hold rates constant and signaled 3.25 point rate cuts next year. Inflation has eased, but remains higher than the Fed's 2% target. Equities rallied on the news as rates fell across the yield curve. While this news was helpful, it will take time for capital markets and deal activity to pick up. As Phil mentioned, we expect that market recovery will come later than we anticipated in our September fiscal year 2024 guidance.\nFor the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 7% to $542 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 7% to $541 million, due to higher wealth sales and increased sales of data. For our geographic segment, organic revenues grew by 8% in the Americas, almost 6% in EMEA and 8% in Asia Pacific.\nTurning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year to $353 million, driven by higher employee expense, technology costs and royalties. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 80 basis points to 35%. This was due to a decrease in professional fees, personnel and facilities costs, partially offset by higher technology-related expenses.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 9%, primarily driven by technology expense, which increased 28% year-over-year. We've continued to invest in technology to drive growth with technology costs now representing about 9% of revenue, consistent with our medium-term outlook. Employee expense grew 8% year-over-year, primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees.\nThird-party data content costs increased 12% due to lapping of onetime accrual release in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as higher variable fee expenses. Finally, our continued efforts to right size our real estate footprint resulted in a 1% decrease in year-over-year facilities expenses. Looking at margin, adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 37.6%, driven by the previously mentioned higher technology expenses, partially offset by lower facilities, professional services and T&E expenses.\nAs always, you'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percent of revenue, our cost of services was about 140 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and about 220 basis points higher on an adjusted basis, largely due to technology and personnel costs. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 230 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 150 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This was due to decreases in professional fees, facilities expenses and personnel expenses.\nTurning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 15.2% compared to last year's rate of 13.4%. This increase was primarily due to lower benefits related to stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting. The remainder of the increase was due to higher pretax income and a higher foreign tax rate, partially offset by foreign tax credits.\nTurning now to EPS. GAAP EPS increased 9.1% to $3.84 this quarter versus $3.52 in the prior year. This was driven by higher revenue and margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 3.3% to $4.12, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by margin compression and a higher tax rate.\nEBITDA increased $219 million, up 9.3% year-over-year, due to higher net income and higher income tax add-backs. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $139 million for the quarter, an increase of 56% over the same period last year. This was driven by significantly higher net cash from operating activities, which was nearly $50 million greater year-over-year due to higher cash collections.\nTurning to share repurchases. For the quarter, we repurchased 135,950 shares for $59.9 million at an average price of $440.67. We intend to continue our share repurchases during fiscal 2024 with a target of 250 million of purchases spread ratably throughout the year. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.\nCombining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $378.6 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months. As a reminder, we also increased our dividend by 10% to $0.98 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. And finally, turning to our revised guidance for fiscal 2024, as Phil mentioned earlier, we expect that the market recovery will happen later in the year than anticipated when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2024.\nGiven this revised view, we are guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services growth of $110 million to $150 million, reflecting 6% growth at the midpoint down from our original 7% growth guidance. Given the headwinds in ASV and the lagged timing of ASV in the first half of the fiscal year, we are lowering our expected revenue range to $2.2 billion to $2.21 billion. At the midpoint, revenue growth is also expected to be approximately 6%, a deceleration of about 75 basis points from our previously issued guidance.\nWe've reduced our GAAP operating margin guidance to 32.5% to 33%, which is down from 33.1% to 33.5%. However, it should be noted that we have not changed our adjusted operating margin guidance of 36.3% to 36.7%. At the midpoint, this provides 30 basis points of continued margin expansion. While we have already met our adjusted operating margin medium-term outlook of 36%, we are committed to balancing continued sustainable margin expansion with investments to drive top line growth.\nIt is also worth noting that our effective tax rate guidance has been reduced by 50 basis points to 16.5% to 17.5%. and finally, adjusted EPS is expected to range from $15.60 to $16, which represents 7.8% growth at the midpoint and a $0.10 reduction from guidance at the midpoint. As Phil mentioned, we continued to execute disciplined expense management to support strategic investment to grow our top line.\nAccordingly, we expect to take a $10 million to $15 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Focus areas for expense reduction include both variable and personnel-related costs. Despite the uncertain environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth. We have a diverse pipeline and are seeing improved price realization and increased interest in our products. In addition, our enterprise contracts and diverse end markets provide us with downside protection in an uncertain market. As a result, we are confident that we are positioned well for the future. We are now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year results. We ended fiscal 2023 with organic ASV plus professional services growth of 7%, and we delivered annual revenue of $2.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $14.55. In 2023, we grew our business on the strength of our enterprise offerings that drove large strategic wins across several workflows. We expanded our presence with existing clients while adding new logos and new users, both on and off platform.\nOn the buy side, our industry-leading analytics and middle office solutions drove a significant performance deal as asset managers and asset owners rely on FactSet to serve more of the portfolio life cycle. Additionally, a large real-time deployment at an institutional asset manager underscored growing demand for cloud-native market data services. On the sell side, deep sector drove a key banking deal in the fourth quarter and continue to be a deciding factor in renewals, situating us well to increase market share in banking.\nOur strategy to deliver the leading open contents and analytics platform continues to resonate and drive growth. But the pace of change is accelerating. While we have been innovating with machine learning and AI for a long time, the recent advances in generative AI have made it possible for us to step up our development. In the second half of 2023, we began moving significant resources to gen AI in anticipation of directing further investment to this area in fiscal 2024, putting it among our top initiatives.\nFactSet's content refinery provides us with a real competitive advantage. We have one of the most extensive suites of proprietary and third-party data in the industry, and we continue to invest in new categories of data to further power the workflows of our clients. On top of our content refinery, we are reimagining the FactSet user experience and actively exploring innovative solutions, for example, a conversational user interface that allows bankers to ask questions, discover and source information and initiate tasks. Generative AI will also help us evolve our productivity suite, further deepening our competitive moat.\nSecond, on the buy side, we are enhancing our portfolio manager bot to answer questions in conversation with asset managers. Thirdly, in the front office, we are harnessing generative AI to create code in FactSet's programmatic environment, reducing the need to know Python. This will make the power of that programmatic environment available to more users. For wealth managers, we are developing solutions to drive the next best action and to create portfolio summaries for proposal generation and client engagement. And we are establishing gen AI-ready data bundles, allowing clients to augment their own large language models, or LLMs, with our connected auditable data.\nWe also see significant opportunity for cost savings as a result of gen AI projects targeting our efficiency. In fiscal 2023, we began to pilot AI coding initiatives to improve the productivity of our technologists. We also started using our agent assist bot to help with client queries, and we are accelerating the collection of unstructured data across our content refinery with our recent acquisition of idaciti, giving us industry-leading expertise. As we enter fiscal 2024, we will build on our strategic investments in content, generative AI and technology to drive growth and forge deeper client relationships.\nOn the buy side, we intend to use our leading portfolio analytics and middle office solutions to grow our front office market share. We expect our new portfolio manager workstation and open programmatic environment to drive growth. We also see opportunities for FactSet to provide some targeted managed services based on our years of experience. On the sell side, we believe that deep sector and private markets offerings will drive workstation wins across banking, corporate and private equity and venture capital clients. We see an opportunity to capture additional seats in underpenetrated areas with solutions for senior bankers and investor relations professionals, and we expect increased adoption of Cobalt, an anchor product for private equity and venture capital funds.\nIn wealth, we anticipate capturing more market share as we focus on portfolio management, proposal generation and intelligent prospecting to expand our addressable market. Our open and flexible platform will power business development and reporting solutions to connect advisers with clients seeking new sources of insight. Finally, we expect the demand for our off-platform solutions to continue to drive growth across firm types.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter results. Growth was driven by Analytics & Trading and CTS with improved expansion across most firm types. Asset owners continue to have momentum with new logos, transactional revenue from Portware and data feeds. While macro uncertainty continued to contribute to elongated sales cycles and slower decision-making across all firm types, our sales team successfully executed on several large wins and renewals as we ended the fiscal year.\nAnd looking across our regions, organic ASV growth in the Americas was 7%. Performance was driven by asset owners and CTS wins among partners and hedge funds. This was offset by weakness among asset and wealth management clients where retention remained under pressure and expansion was lower. As expected, we also saw lower seasonal banking hiring, which was a common theme across all regions. In EMEA, our organic ASV growth was close to 8%. We saw growth in asset owners, driven by analytics middle asset solutions. Wealth growth was also driven by wealth workstation and adviser dashboard wins. Gains were partially offset by softer expansion in banking and asset management. Finally, Asia Pacific delivered organic ASV growth of 8%, driven by strong growth in Japan, where we saw an increase in large deals, analytic wins and strength in channel partners. However, muted expansion in Australia and India from fewer asset management wins and lower seasonal hiring in banking were headwinds to growth.\nTurning now to our workflow solutions. Analytics & Trading organic ASV grew by 9%. Growth among asset owners accelerated the most, driven by middle office solutions, workstations and feeds. CTS, which is now part of Data Solutions, grew fastest with organic ASV growth slightly over 9%. Performance was driven by channel partners and asset management clients although partially offset by lower professional services and decreased retention in banking. Our data management solutions, company data and real-time offering were the major contributors to growth. CTS also contributed to performance with healthy expansion and new business.\nAmong asset managers, workstation erosion was offset by Analytics and CTS wins, coupled with a higher price increase. Research & Advisory grew organic ASV by 5%. In banking, workstation and deep sector wins were offset by increased erosion. Private equity and venture capital clients continued their track record of double-digit growth despite market headwinds that offset improved pricing realization. For corporates, reduced client budgets were an obstacle. Looking ahead, we are focused on diversifying our solutions for our corporate clients. And finally, in wealth, we saw a strong execution on several renewals in the face of client cost-cutting exercises.\nAs discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our business by firm type to better align our operations with those of our clients. As of September 1, Analytics & Trading has become our institutional buy-side organization, focusing on asset managers, asset owners and hedge fund workflows. Also, as of September 1, Research & Advisory has become our dealmakers in wealth organization, focusing on banking and sell-side research, wealth management, corporate and private equity and venture capital workflows. And we've combined our Content and Content and Technology solutions groups to create 1 Data Solutions organization.\nGoing forward, we will also be aligning our partnerships and CUSIP Global services organizations for the purposes of discussing ASV as they are both key parts of our growth strategy. You can find ASV and ASV growth rates from the perspective of our realignments in the appendix of today's presentation.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2024, we expect the year will be a tale of 2 halves. Unlike previous years, where clients had higher budgets to spend before the calendar year-end, we expect continued caution for the rest of 2023. Starting in the new calendar year, we expect an improved operating environment to drive a strong second half. As such, we are guiding to organic ASV growth of 7% for fiscal 2024. Linda will provide more detail on guidance shortly. Looking forward, we have started seeing green shoots of market recovery, particularly in new business. New logos in the fourth quarter showed an improvement over the reduced deal volumes seen earlier in the fiscal year. We expect this trend to continue as the new business pipeline and potential ASV for wealth management, private equity and venture capital clients and partners are all outpacing the pipeline at the same time last year.\nAs client sentiment improves and markets stabilize, we believe we are in a great position. Our new structure, best-in-class solutions and content sets us apart as the partner of choice for our clients. I'll now turn it over to Linda to take you through the specifics of our fourth quarter and full year performance.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nIncoming Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we delivered Q4 organic ASV plus professional services growth of $145 million. With 43 consecutive years of top line growth, FactSet has a proven history of stability during market volatility, which is clearly demonstrated in our performance. I'll now share additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release.\nThe 7% growth rate for organic ASV plus professional services was in line with our most recent guidance for the year. Our sales team executed well, building on a strong first half and a higher price increase across a larger client base. However, during the second half of the fiscal year, the team had to deal with increased erosion, softer expansion and a slight decrease in new business.\nTurning to revenue. Our full year revenue of $2.1 billion was also within our guidance range of $2.08 billion to $2.1 billion. To help offset the weaker top line, we carefully and thoughtfully trimmed our headcount, which helped to expand our adjusted operating margin by 230 basis points to 36.2%. This increase exceeded the top end of our guidance range of 36% and our previous medium-term outlook goal of 36% by the end of FY '25. Finally, both GAAP and adjusted EPS were impacted by a onetime charge of $6.8 million and an approximately $20 million provision for confirmed and expected unrealizable tax assets. This higher tax rate provision had a $0.68 negative impact on fiscal '23 adjusted EPS, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 8.3% to $14.55. Without this onetime adjustment, adjusted EPS would have been approximately $15.25 or 13.6% growth. I'll provide more detail during the tax discussion later in the call.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter results. As Phil noted, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 7% year-over-year as higher price increases offset erosion and new business began to pick up. We also continue to improve pricing discipline, which is driving stronger price realization. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 7% to $536 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 7% to $535 million, driven primarily by Analytics & Trading. For our geographic segments, organic revenue grew by 6% in the Americas, 9% in EMEA and 10% in Asia Pacific. Growth was primarily driven by Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory in the Americas and Asia Pacific and by Content and Technology Solutions and Analytics & Trading in EMEA.\nGAAP operating expenses increased 14% year-over-year to $419 million, driven by higher facilities impairment expense and restructuring costs. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin decreased by 460 basis points to 22%, primarily due to those nonrecurring charges and higher technology costs, partially offset by lower third-party content costs and lower FX impact. Excluding both nonrecurring costs, GAAP operating margin was about 800 basis points higher than the prior year. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 4%, driven primarily by technology expense, which increased 26% year-over-year. This was mainly due to higher amortization of internal use software, increased third-party software costs and accelerated cloud spend as part of our hybrid cloud strategy. We also invested in our content refinery expansion and other strategic areas such as generative AI. We have continued to invest in technology to drive growth with technology costs now representing 9% of revenue, consistent with our medium-term outlook of these costs being 8.5% to 9.5% of revenue.\nPeople expense grew 3% year-over-year, primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees. As a percentage of revenue, our people expense was 168 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by a lower bonus accrual, partially offset by higher salary expenses. We ended fiscal 2023 with a bonus pool of $105 million and with 67% of our employees operating in our centers of excellence. Adjusted operating expense growth was partially offset by a reduction in our third-party content costs, which decreased 4%. Our team continues to do a stellar job proactively managing and negotiating contracts. As a percentage of revenue, growth in third-party content costs was 57 basis points lower year-over-year.\nFinally, our efforts to rightsize our real estate footprint resulted in a 7% decrease in facility expense year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, this was 50 basis points lower than the previous year. Overall, adjusted operating margin improved by 210 basis points to 33.6%. You'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was about 75 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 85 basis points lower on an adjusted basis, largely due to personnel costs, expenses related to CGS and technology costs. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 385 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 125 basis points lower on an adjusted basis, primarily due to decreases in professional services, partially offset by increased personnel costs. Facilities impairments as a percentage of revenue were around 440 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis.\nTurning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 39.9% compared to last year's rate of 10.3%. This increase was due to several factors. First, we had higher pretax income, which increases the overall tax rate as credits related to R&D and foreign earned income are less impactful. We also saw a diminishing benefit from tax incentives in our centers of excellence. Finally, the finalization of prior year returns came into play. Our fourth quarter results include an out-of-period adjustment related to an ongoing review and analysis of certain tax positions, resulting in a onetime charge of $6.8 million and $20 million provision. We believe this $20 million provision represents the maximum remaining amount of net unrealizable tax assets. Upon completion of our review and prior to filing our annual report on Form 10-K, we plan to take a onetime charge with respect to this provision to reflect the confirmed actual amount of net unrealizable tax assets. The final amount of this charge is not expected to differ significantly from the current $20 million provision.\nAt this time, we've concluded that this adjustment is not material to the current period financial statements. The adjustment relates to the accounting of tax balance sheet accounts, including deferred tax assets and liabilities. All local, federal and foreign taxes payable have been paid in a timely manner, subject to normal audits of open years. The increase in tax provision was partially offset by higher benefits from stock option exercises and refunds from amended returns. Looking ahead, we expect that higher pretax income will increase our overall tax rate. In addition, our foreign tax rate is expected to be higher due to the increase in the U.K. statutory rate. We've taken strategic measures intended to offset our overall rate and are guiding to a 17% to 18% effective tax rate for fiscal '24.\nGAAP EPS decreased 37.5% to $1.68 this quarter versus $2.69 in the prior year, driven by nonrecurring charges and the higher tax provision which had a $0.68 impact. On an adjusted basis, EPS decreased 6.4% to $2.93. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $172 million, up 8.6% year-over-year due to higher income tax add-backs and impairment charges, partially offset by lower net income. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $156 million for the quarter, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. This was primarily driven by the timing of income tax payments, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.\nFor the fourth quarter, ASV retention remained greater than 95% and client retention was 91%, which speaks to the stickiness of our solutions. We ended the quarter with almost 8,000 clients with 383 new logos added year-over-year, and user count increased by about 10,000 primarily within banking, corporate and private equity and venture capital firms. For the quarter, we repurchased 264,400 shares for $109.6 million at an average price of $414.63. At the end of fiscal '23, we had $4.5 million available for share repurchase. As a result, our Board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $300 million, which became effective on September 1. We intend to continue our share repurchases in FY '24, with a target to repurchase $250 million spread ratably throughout the year.\nWe remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $315.3 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months. As a reminder, we also increased our dividend by 10% in the third quarter, marking the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nAnd finally, turning to our guidance for fiscal 2024. As Phil discussed earlier, we expect a weaker first half of fiscal '24 and a stronger second half driven by improved client sentiment. As client budgets reset at the turn of the calendar year, we expect to execute on our existing pipeline. Given these expectations, we are guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services of $130 million to $175 million, reflecting 7% growth at the midpoint. And with respect to modeling income and expenses for the year, please note that for the full year, we expect interest expense to be $60 million to $65 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. We expect adjusted operating margin of 36.3% to 36.7%. At the midpoint, this provides 30 basis points of continued margin expansion. While we have already met our adjusted operating margin medium-term outlook of 36%, we are committed to balancing continued sustainable margin expansion with investments to drive top line growth. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to range from $15.65 to $16.15, which represents 9% growth at the midpoint.\nIn closing, we are encouraged by the opportunities before us. In 2024, we anticipate that our investments in generative AI, connected refined content and digital solutions will drive expanded market share and increase retention. We are equipping our teams to harness the rapid pace of innovation to remain the partner of choice for our clients. We're now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the FactSet Research Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kendra Brown, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKendra Brown\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Third Fiscal Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we will reference during the presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com and is currently available on our website. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. [Operator Instructions]\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our third quarter results. Our organic ASV plus professional services grew 8% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit ASP growth in Analytics, where we saw strength with asset managers, asset owners and hedge funds and the successful execution of our international price increase. These gains were offset by headwinds to workstation growth among wealth, banking and corporate clients and deceleration in expansion among partners.\nOur investments in content and technology have strengthened our competitive position, allowing us to navigate market volatility successfully. In the third quarter, we saw broad-based growth across all firm types with double-digit ASV growth from our wealth management, banking, hedge fund, corporate and private equity and venture capital clients.\nIn Analytics & Trading, we saw continued strength in the middle office as our suite of portfolio reporting, fixed income performance and risk solutions accelerated growth year-over-year. Content & Technology solutions also had double-digit ASP growth with demand for company data and data management solutions driving ASV this quarter. And in Research & Advisory, we see continued opportunities to capture additional desktops in banking wealth. Workflow-driven capabilities also contributed to growth with our research management solutions suite accelerating year-over-year.\nWe ended the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.79 and and an adjusted operating margin of 36%. As we enter our fourth quarter, we are focused on operational efficiencies and disciplined expense management to support margin expansion, grow EPS and provide capital to invest in our strategic priorities. As part of this effort, we are working to reduce the run rate of our expense base by about 3%. Savings will come primarily from rightsizing our workforce, which we expect also will decrease by about 3% and further reducing our real estate costs.\nAs discussed last quarter, we are seeing a modest deceleration in ASV growth. And while the markets have remained largely resilient amid macroeconomic turbulence, our clients do remain cautious. Clients have also been executing their own downturn playbooks, resulting in delayed decisions and restricted spending. We also see continued staffing adjustments with firms on both the buy and sell side reducing head count, often targeting mid- and senior-level professionals. And while we have a stronger pipeline than last year, with a good mix of deals that should drive expansion in new business, client decision-making is taking longer.\nWe're also monitoring developments in the banking sector. Early sentiment is mixed on fiscal 2024 [ plus sizes ]. And while some clients are slowing hiring, others are adding junior bankers in preparation for a market upturn. Overall, our top 200 clients, including many of the leading global investment banks, make up 2/3 of our book. And the vast majority of these clients have multiyear contracts, including minimums and 90-day cancellation windows. Given these points and our high ASV retention rate, which is consistently greater than 95%, we believe we have effective downside protection.\nWith this outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming guidance for organic ASV growth and revenue, but guiding to the lower end of our previously disclosed ranges. In addition, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Linda will provide further details on this later in the call.\nWe are confident in our strategy and ability to execute. And like our clients, we are ensuring that we are well positioned as the market stabilizes and the capital market cycle turns. We have a long-term view of our business and are committed to investing for growth and becoming a more efficient organization. As part of this approach, starting September 1, we are reorganizing by firm type to better align our operations with those of our clients.\nAnalytics & Trading will become our buy-side organization, focusing on asset managers, asset owners, hedge fund workflows. Research & Advisory will become dealmakers in wealth, focusing on banking and sell-side research, wealth management, corporate and private equity and venture capital workflows. And finally, we are combining our Content and Content & Technology solutions groups to create one data solutions organization. This will create end-to-end management of our data from collection and acquisition to client delivery. We'll provide more details on our progress and the performance of our firm types as we refine the structure over fiscal 2024.\nTechnology is rapidly evolving. As an early adopter of cloud technology, we digitally transformed our platform and created flexible workflow-centric solutions. Now with a focus on generative AI, our open platform and connected content will strengthen our partnership with our clients. While generative AI is not new, FactSet has been using AI and machine language in our products for many years, and the recent advances in large language models or LLMs present new opportunities.\nOur strategy is to build a generative AI foundation and capabilities, empowering our workforce to transform our end-user experience rapidly. We are investing in generative AI technology to drive next-generation workflow solutions. We will also continue to invest in the scaling of our content refinery. We've committed additional resources to LLM initiatives as part of our investment process, and FactSetters are excited about these investments as we equip all products and engineering teams to use generative AI in their development work.\nOur early work in generative AI has focused on improving client support, automating content collection and transforming our products with improved search and copilot solutions. Here are a few examples.\nDuring our recent hackathon, almost 1/3 of FactSetters projects used LLMs to solve business problems or to improve the client experience. Teams worked on enhancing banker efficiency, pitch automation and discoverability using our modernized connected data.\nEarlier this month, we used ChatGPT to produce call Street earnings call transcript summaries, reducing summation time by more than 90%. This process is currently available for all S&P 500 companies, and we plan to dramatically expand coverage later this fiscal year.\nWe are also testing AI-powered agent assist tools that understand FactSet proprietary codes. This use case is compelling. Questions about FactSet coding comprise half of our daily client call volume. And finally, we see significant opportunities to accelerate content automation using generative AI. We have several promising efforts underway to extract information that has previously been difficult to retrieve.\nOur differentiator remains our content, including our real-time and deep sector data for which we have also increased investment. FactSet has an incredibly strong moat of 40 years of proprietary content and data cleanly sourced, auditable and stitched together with our concordance and symbology. It is not easily replicable and is incredibly valuable to FactSet and our clients.\nTurning to our performance. We saw continued acceleration across all our regions. Americas organic ASV growth accelerated year-over-year to 8%, growing through wins with premier asset managers and asset owners. These gains were partially offset by workstation headwinds with wealth, banking and corporate clients. EMEA was the biggest contributor to growth this quarter with organic ASV growth accelerating to 7.4%. Growth was strongest in banking given improved retention with banking clients and improved retention and new business with hedge funds. Higher retention was also a key driver in the region as the ASP uplift from our price increase offset increased erosion.\nIn contrast, expansion slowed as cost pressures created higher budget scrutiny, lengthening the sales cycle. Finally, Asia Pacific delivered organic ASV growth of 10.5%. Performance was driven by wealth management, hedge funds and private equity and venture capital clients with improved retention and ASV uplift from higher realized price increases.\nAustralia was the strongest contributor to growth with wins among asset managers and asset owners. However, sector consolidation and net negative seasonal banking hiring contributed to a small deceleration. We also saw acceleration in Japan and India driven by banking with a positive increase in workstation purchases for seasonal hires.\nIn summary, we continue to execute well in challenging markets. As we head into the close of our fiscal year, our pipeline remains solid, and we are unwavering regarding execution excellence and cost discipline. As we combine relentless client focus with exciting new technologies, I am confident in our ability to drive growth.\nI'll now turn it over to Linda to take you through the specifics of our third quarter.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nIncoming Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we delivered solid operating results in the third quarter with continued growth for organic ASV, GAAP revenue and adjusted diluted EPS year-over-year. I'll now share some additional details on our third quarter performance. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release.\nWe grew organic ASV plus professional services by 8% year-over-year. While we are seeing lower expansion and higher erosion due to the macroeconomic environment, our performance reflects excellent execution by our sales team. Pricing realization continues to improve with our international price increase, adding $17 million in ASV this quarter, up $4.5 million from last year. Internationally, 7% more clients were subject to the annual price increase than in the prior year.\nFiscal year-to-date, our 2023 price increase has yielded $18 million more ASV than last year. GAAP revenue increased by 8.4% to $530 million for the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 8.5% to $530 million. Growth was primarily driven by Analytics & Trading and Content & Technology solutions.\nFor our geographic segments, on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was 9%, benefiting from increases in Content & Technology solutions and Analytics & Trading. EMEA revenue grew at 7.5% primarily driven by Content & Technology solutions and Analytics & Trading. And finally, Asia Pacific revenue growth came in at 7.9% due to increases in Research & Advisory and Content & Technology solutions.\nWhile GAAP operating expenses decreased 8.6% year-over-year to $358 million, adjusted operating expenses grew 9.4%. The drivers were as follows. First, people. Our cost rose 10% year-over-year in the third quarter primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees. As a percentage of revenue, this was 68 basis points higher year-over-year driven by higher salary growth as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher labor capitalization and lower bonus expense. For fiscal 2023, we still expect the bonus pool to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million.\nHead count increased by 12.9% year-over-year with most new positions in our centers of excellence. Overall, 65% of our employees are located in our centers of excellence.\nNext, facilities expense remained relatively flat, increasing by only 1.6% year-over-year as more employees return to in-office work. Our continuing efforts to rightsize our real estate footprint mostly offset this increase. As a percentage of revenue, facilities expense was 24 basis points lower year-over-year.\nMoving on. Technology expenses increased by 22.5% driven by third-party software costs and higher amortization of internal-use software, partially offset by lower cloud-related expenses and lower depreciation. As a percentage of revenue, growth was 90 basis points higher year-over-year.\nIn partnership with our Chief Technology Officer, Kate Step, we realized increased capitalization through improved time tracking and other efforts. Technology costs currently equals 7.8% of our revenue and will likely continue to increase as we invest for growth. As part of our medium-term outlook, we anticipate technology costs being 8.5% to 9.5% of revenue.\nAnd finally, our team continues to do an excellent job of controlling third-party content costs with expenses increasing by only 1.9% year-over-year despite the inflationary environment. As a percentage of revenue, growth in third-party content costs was 31 basis points lower year-over-year.\nGiven the pressure on our top line, it is imperative that we focus on cost management. Using our downturn playbook, we took proactive steps to control our expenses, protect margins and preserve EPS. We're now going to further identify areas where we can reduce costs.\nAs part of the efforts Phil spoke about earlier, we plan to take an approximately $45 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. This charge includes approximately $15 million to $20 million for continued real estate rightsizing as discussed in last quarter's call.\nCompared to the previous year, our third fiscal quarter GAAP operating margin increased by 1,260 basis points to 32.5% mainly driven by the prior year's $49 million impairment charge and expenses related to the acquisition of CGS. Excluding both nonrecurring transactions, GAAP operating margin was around 30 basis points higher than the prior year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 36%. This was largely driven by higher personnel costs and technology expenses, partially offset by lower third-party content costs and lower facilities expense. You will find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 7 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 283 basis points higher on an adjusted basis largely due to personnel costs, expenses related to CGS and technology costs. As a percentage of revenue, our impairment expense was 994 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis as we lap the prior year's impairment charge.\nOn a GAAP basis, SG&A was 269 basis points lower year-over-year as a percentage of revenue and 46 basis points lower on an adjusted basis primarily due to decreases in professional services, partially offset by increased personnel costs.\nTurning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.9% compared to last year's rate of 12.2%. Our higher tax rate is primarily due to lower stock option exercises. Our current expectation is that we will end fiscal 2023 with an effective tax rate of 14% to 15%. While we continue to experience variability, which includes increases in foreign tax rates, we are researching strategies to help reduce the overall rate.\nGAAP EPS increased 79.3% to $3.46 this quarter versus $1.93 in the prior year driven by the lapping of the prior year's nonrecurring items, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% to $3.79 primarily due to revenue growth offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower operating margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $205 million, up 15.6% year-over-year due to higher operating income.\nAnd finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $193 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the same period last year. This was primarily driven by cash generated from working capital changes and the timing of income tax payments.\nOur ASV retention for the third quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew our total number of clients by 451 compared to the prior year driven by corporate and wealth clients and partners. With client retention of 92% year-over-year, our sales and client support teams are to be commended for continuing to execute well despite market conditions.\nWe remain committed to returning long-term value to shareholders. As previously discussed, we resumed share repurchases in the third quarter. We repurchased 165,950 shares for a total of $67.1 million at an average share price of $404.29. Under our current plan, which we anticipate completing in the fourth quarter, $114.2 million was available for share repurchases as of May 31, 2023. And additionally, this week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization plan of $300 million that will take effect on September 1.\nOver the last 12 months, combining our dividends and share repurchases, we've returned $202.1 million to our shareholders and recently increased our dividend by 10%. This marks the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nAnd finally, our guidance for fiscal 2023. While there are signs that the macro environment will start to recover over the next few months, the markets remain uncertain. Last quarter, we updated our guidance to reflect organic ASV growth of $145 million to $175 million, a slight deceleration from the guidance provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. This range reflects ASV growth of $135 million to $165 million from the core business and $10 million in ASV growth from CUSIP Global Services. We also updated our revenue guidance from $2.08 billion to $2.1 billion, which was a slight deceleration from the previous guidance. As discussed earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for those metrics but at the lower end of the ranges.\nFor GAAP operating margin, we expect our onetime restructuring charges to decrease our guidance range to 29% to 30%, a 50 basis point decrease from the previous guidance. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.24 to $12.65. For adjusted metrics, we expect our financial discipline and cost management focus to drive an adjusted operating margin of 35% to 36%. This represents a 100 basis point increase from the previously communicated guidance range and meets our 2022 Investor Day outlook 2 years ahead of our 2025 target. Finally, we are increasing the range of adjusted diluted EPS by $0.25 at the midpoint to $14.75 to $15.15 for fiscal 2023.\nIn closing, we are encouraged by our performance this quarter and our ability to execute on a solid pipeline as we finish the fiscal year. We are confident in our ability to balance macro headwinds with margin expansion and expense management to continue investing in our people and products. As the pace of innovation accelerates, our deep content moat and open digital platform will strengthen our partnership with our clients and allow us to capture additional market share. We are committed to sustainable growth and excited about the opportunities before us.\nAnd with that, we're now ready for your questions. Operator?"

We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer for the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nPhil Snow\n\nThank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our second quarter and first half results. Our Organic ASV plus Professional Services growth year-over-year accelerated to 9.1%, driven by a healthy expansion among existing clients and the successful execution by our sales team of our price increase in the Americas. We saw several large wins this quarter outpacing last year and allowing us to capture more of the addressable market.\nOur second fiscal quarter performance resulted in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.80 and an adjusted operating margin of 37% exceeding our guidance and situating us well for the remainder of the fiscal year. Growth this quarter was the strongest amongst banking, asset owners and wealth management clients aided by larger wins across each of these client types. Acceleration was broad-based with double-digit ASV growth from our banking, corporate and private equity and venture capital clients and our investments in Content & Technology supported retention and expansion.\nWe saw our core workstation drive follow-on opportunities for feeds and digital platforms and wealth and increased transactional revenue and demand for content from asset owners. In the first half, our end markets remained largely supportive. However, we are not immune to market volatility. As interest rates rise and macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, we're beginning to see a more challenging environment for our clients. This includes reductions in AUM, constrained budgets and headcount rightsizing after increased pandemic hiring. We're also monitoring the recent instability across the banking sector, which accounts for 17% of our ASV. In this regard, there are several key factors to keep in mind. First, FactSet is not materially exposed to commercial banking. \nSecond, no one single client represents more than 3% of our ASV. And finally, our multi-year enterprise contracts of our protections that includes seat minimums and longer cancellation notification windows.\nGiven the evolving market dynamics, particularly in banking, we feel it is prudent to take a conservative view on the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect continued ASV growth, but with modest deceleration in the second half. We are therefore updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect organic ASV growth of $145 million to a $175 million, inclusive of CUSIP Global Services, which becomes an organic part of our business in the third quarter.\nAt the midpoint, this is a $15 million reduction in core business ASV growth. We expect two-thirds of this reduction to come from the challenging conditions facing the banking sector and the remaining one-third is expected to come from lengthening sales cycles and constrained budgets for other firm types. This reduction in ASV will be offset by the addition of $10 million of ASV growth from CGS. Together, these changes represent 8% growth at the midpoint in-line with our medium term outlook.\nTo preserve EPS, we will continue to drive disciplined expense management. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin of 34% to 35%, as previously communicated. We maintain a long-term view of our business and are steadfast in our commitment to investing for growth and we will speak more about CGS and guidance later in the call. The demand for data and technology is increasing and we are a proven trusted partner for our clients for their digital transformations. In the second fiscal quarter, we remained focused on building the leading open content and analytics platform and several large deals reinforced our conviction regarding this strategy.\nFirst, within Research & Advisory, we were selected as the primary market data provider for BMO's Wealth Management division. This was a key contributor to almost 9% workstation growth year-over-year. Our on-going investments in our digital platform and content refinery also resulted in wins across banking. The most notable was a seven-figure deal for a global bank sell-side research department, which included workstations and data feeds. \nAcross the sell-side, we are meeting the needs of flexible integrated solutions, including feeds, APIs, CRM integrations and banker productivity tools. In Content & Technology solutions, we won a major real time deal to provide our market data-as-a-service offering to a premier asset management client. This solution will replace its legacy on-premise infrastructure. Our ability to augment enterprise platform deployments with consistent data is accelerating growth and expanding our share of wallet for Content & Technology solutions.\nFinally, within Analytics & Trading, investment in our portfolio lifecycle suite has increased cross-sell opportunities with active asset managers and asset owners. Within the middle office, growth accelerated in our core analytics offering, which includes Portfolio Analytics, Quantitative Solutions, Fixed-income and Reporting.\nWe also see increased buy-side demand for outsourced performance and risk solutions, consistent with the trend toward investment firms outsourcing middle office functions. Our open platform and enterprise solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on this with several other opportunities in our pipeline.\nAs we celebrate the first anniversary of the acquisition of CUSIP Global Services, I'd like to congratulate the team on a job well done. CGS has exceeded expectations with ASV growth of 8% since the acquisition. CGS's Core Securities Identification capabilities align well with FactSet's data management strategy. And with the integration now complete, we are focused on growth across asset classes, geographies and capabilities.\nWe are working on expanding into loan data and private companies. For more than 50 years, CGS has provided mission-critical solutions to the front, middle and back-office. This work continues and in close partnership with the American Bankers Association we will continue to innovate.\nTurning to performance across our regions. Organic ASV growth in the Americas accelerated year-over-year to 9.3% driven by strength in Analytics & Trading and Content & Technology solutions and the execution of our price increase. Our Americas price increase delivered $30.7 million in ASV, up $10.6 million from last year. In addition, the region benefited from improved expansion with banking, wealth management and asset management clients. We also had strong sales of middle office solutions.\nWhile new business decelerated overall for the quarter, we saw strength in new logos from asset owners. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered Organic ASV growth of 10.8%, performance was driven by research with improved expansion and retention in banking. Expansion also improved among asset managers and asset owners, although this was partially offset by client cancellations. Given the recent changes in COVID policy across Asia, we are starting to see improvement in the pipeline. However, we expect a light effect as the market normalizes.\nFinally in EMEA, Organic ASV growth accelerated to 8.1%. Acceleration was driven by Analytics & Trading, where we saw an improvement in expansion and retention among asset owners. Improved retention among private equity and venture capital firms and hedge funds also contributed to growth. However, we also experienced headwinds as the major markets in the region remain under cost pressure and the United Kingdom begins to see an adverse impact from Brexit. In summary, I'm pleased with our first half performance. We're confident in our ability to meet our medium term outlook, despite marketing conditions, and as we head into the second half, we have a solid pipeline, driven by our open platform, connected content and market-leading workflow solutions. And with more than 40 years of growth, FactSet, has a proven history of successfully navigating market volatility.\nOur greatest asset is our people and I'd like to wrap-up by recognizing their diligence and commitment to our strategic priorities. We were honored to be named one of Glassdoor's Best Places to Work in 2023 and I want to thank all FactSetters for helping create the culture that made this award possible. At FactSet, we're committed to growth for our clients, employees, investors and communities. We recently published our fiscal year 2022 sustainability report themes commitment to action. The report highlights the progress we have made in turning our commitments into action. And I encourage you all to take a look. I'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our second fiscal quarter performance in more detail.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nIncoming Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we're pleased to report continued high single-digit organic ASV growth and double-digit growth of revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year.\nI will now share additional details on our second quarter performance. Consistent with our definition of organic revenues in ASV, we will exclude any revenue in ASV associated with CUSIP Global Services when reporting organic metrics. Given the first anniversary of the CGS acquisition on March 1st, 2023, CGS will be included in the organic results of FactSet as a component of our CTS business starting in the third fiscal quarter of 2023.\nAs Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release. We grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9.1% year-over-year and acceleration over the last quarter and a solid finish for our first half. Our performance reflects the strength of our recurring sales model and disciplined execution by our sales team as our clients look to technology and data to drive alpha. We saw improved retention and expansion among existing clients. Price realization also continues to improve as we executed a higher price increase over a larger client base. \nGAAP revenue increased by 19.5% to $515 million for the second quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange increased 8.9% to $470 million.\nGrowth was driven primarily by CGS and our Analytics & Trading and Content & Technology solutions. For our geographic segments, on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was 8.2%, benefiting from increases in Content & Technology solutions and Analytics & Trading. EMEA revenue also grew at 8.2%, primarily due to growth in Analytics & Trading. And finally, Asia Pacific revenue growth increased 15.3% due to increases in Research & Advisory and Content & Technology solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 12.4% in the second quarter to $346 million. And I'll now detail the drivers based on our primary cost buckets.\nFirst, people, our expenses grew by 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily due to increased salary and bonus expenses for existing employees. As a percentage of revenue, this was 350 basis points lower year-over-year, driven by slower salary growth as a percentage of revenue, higher labor capitalization and FX benefit. We saw headcount increase by 10.3% year-over-year, with two-thirds of these new positions located in our Centers of Excellence.\nAnd as a reminder, more than 66% of our employees are located in our Centers of Excellence. Next, facilities expense decreased by 7% year-over-year due to our reduced real estate footprint lapping of the previous year's impairment charge of $10 million and FX benefit. As a percentage of revenue, this was 360 basis points lower year-over-year.  As we continue our intense focus on cost management, we expect to take another real estate charge of approximately $15 million to $20 million later this fiscal year.\nMoving on, technology expenses increased by 27%, driven by increased cloud spend, third party software costs and higher amortization of internal use software. As a percentage of revenue growth was 50 basis points higher year-over-year due to higher capitalization of internal use software.\nAs we explained during last year's Investor Day, we anticipate technology costs being 8.5% to 9% of revenue over the medium term. Technology expenses will likely continue to increase as we invest for growth. And finally, third party content costs increased by 5% year-over-year. Our team is doing an excellent job of controlling third party data costs despite inflationary pressure. As a percentage of revenue growth in third party content costs was 70 basis points lower year-over-year.\nAnd now turning to the margin front. Our GAAP operating margin increased by 430 basis points to 32.9% compared to the previous year. Our adjusted operating margin improved by 330 basis points to 37%. Margin expansion resulted from higher revenue, lower personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. The lapping of the prior year's impairment charge and lower content and facilities costs. These savings were slightly offset by higher technology costs and expenses related to CGS.\nAs a percentage of revenue. Our impairment expense was 230 basis points lower than last year's on a GAAP basis. You'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 50 basis points higher than last year's on a GAAP basis, largely as a result of increased amortization of intangible assets expenses related to CGS and technology costs.\nThis was partially offset by lower personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. On an adjusted basis, it was 180 basis points lower due to lower personnel costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by expenses related to CGS and higher technology costs. And finally, on a GAAP basis, SG&A was 245 basis points lower year-over-year as a percentage of revenue and 150 basis points lower on an adjusted basis.\nThis was primarily due to decreases in facilities expense and professional services. This was partially offset by an increase in T&E as our teams resumed essential travels. Turning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.1%, a 6.2% increase compared to last year's rate of 9.9%.\nThe higher Q2 tax rate is due to higher pre-tax income and lower stock option exercise. Going forward, it's important to note that we expect more volatility in our tax rate. One driver will be foreign tax. In April, the UK statutory rate will increase from 19% to 25%, increasing FactSet's foreign effective tax rate and reducing the tax benefit of foreign income. Stock option exercise will also fluctuate with our stock price generally, resulting in lower tax rate when the stock price is higher and higher tax rate when the price is lower. Also, as we finalize our tax returns for prior years, we have the potential for one -time charges, which could also be helpful. Even with this variability and a higher tax rate for the second quarter, we expect to end fiscal 2023 with an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14.5%.\nGAAP EPS increased 19% to $3.38 this quarter versus $2.84 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 16.2% to $3.80. Both EPS figures were driven by higher revenue and margin expansion, partially offset by increased interest expense and the higher tax rate.\nAlso of note, Q2 EBITDA increased to $200 million, up 45.4% year-over -year due to higher operating income. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $147 million for the quarter, an increase of 34% over the same period last year.\nThis was due to higher net income, partially offset by increased capitalization costs from internal use software. We would note that strong free cash flow continues to be an attractive feature of FactSet's business model. Our ASV retention for the second quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew our total number of clients by 558 compared to the prior year, driven by corporate and wealth clients and channel partners. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, demonstrating excellent execution by our sales and client support teams.\nMoving on to our balance sheet, during the second quarter, we completed another $125 million prepayment of the three-year term loan for the CGS acquisition. This was our fourth prepayment since the start of the loan. This brought our gross leverage ratio down to 2.4 times from 3.9 times level when we initially financed the CGS acquisition. This is well within our 2.5 times to 2 times gross leverage target and appropriate for our investment grade rating. Given that we are within our target range, we will slow the pace of repayment of the remaining 500 million outstanding balance of the term loan, which matures in 2025. Also, given our reduced leverage levels, we intend to resume share repurchases for the remainder of fiscal 2023. We currently have $181.3 million available for share repurchase under the company's existing authorization. \nWe plan to allocate this amount equally in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. While bringing our repurchases back to previous levels will take time. We're focused on returning capital to shareholders. We will provide updates on our share repurchase program in the coming months.\nAs Phil stated earlier, given our reduced core ASV outlook and the inclusion of CUSIP Global Services as part of our organic results, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023. We expect organic ASV growth of $145 million to $175 million, which is a $15 million reduction in core ASV growth at the midpoint. \nThe decline is offset by the $10 million addition of CUSIP and remains within our medium term outlook of 8% to 9% organic ASV growth. Given the headwinds to ASV and lag timing of ASV in the first fiscal quarter, we expect revenue for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.1 billion. At the midpoint, revenue growth is expected to be about 13%, a deceleration of 95 basis points from our previously issued guidance.\nDespite a slightly softer top line, we are confident that our disciplined expense management will allow us to protect margins and preserve EPS. Consistent with our downturn playbook, areas of focus include ongoing real estate rightsizing, rationalization of third party content costs and limiting hiring to essential positions.\nBased on forecasted performance, we also expect our year-end bonus pool to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million, roughly $10 million less than last year, which will provide an additional margin benefit. As a result of these measures, we are maintaining adjusted margin guidance of 34% to 35%, consistent with our Investor Day commitment of 50 basis points to 75 basis points of adjusted margin expansion on average per year. And finally, given the strength of our adjusted operating margin and revenue growth, we expect adjusted EPS of $14.50 to $14.90 for fiscal 2023 as previously communicated. Despite the uncertain environment, we remain confident regarding long-term growth. We have a diverse pipeline and are seeing higher retention, better expansion, improved price realization and increased demand for our products.\nIn addition, our enterprise contracts and diverse end markets provide us with some downside protection in a turbulent market. As a result, we remain committed to our medium term outlook and are positioned well for the future.\nAnd with that, we're now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the FactSet First Fiscal Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would like to hand the conference over to your host today, Kendra Brown, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKendra Brown\n\nHead of IR, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's First Fiscal Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results.\nWe grew organic ASV plus professional services by 8.8% year-over-year, achieving adjusted diluted EPS of $3.99 and an adjusted operating margin of 38.3%. These results demonstrate our continued momentum coming out of fiscal 2022 and lay a solid foundation for executing on our full year targets.\nLast year's Q1 ASV growth was a record for us, and this quarter's performance was a strong result for what is usually our seasonally lowest revenue quarter. The biggest contributors to this quarter's growth came from banking, asset owners and private equity and venture capital clients, all of which exhibited double-digit growth rates. Small and medium-sized deals across client types drove ASV growth this quarter. Our investments in content and technology, including deep sector, private markets, APIs and analytics solutions, continue to support client retention rates and expansion.\nIt's important to acknowledge the continued uncertainty in global markets. While conditions have been supportive, we are starting to see a more challenging environment for our clients, and we are closely watching for signs indicating our prolonged change in conditions. These signs could include reduced client budgets, elongated sales cycles, material layoffs and a reduction in new firm creation. However, FactSet has a proven history of stability and growth in volatile markets, and we remain confident that our strategy and ability to execute will position us well even in a choppy economic cycle.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on building the leading open content and analytics platform, reinforcing our position as an anchor partner for clients, allowing us to grow our share of the addressable market.\nAt the foundation of our strategy is our commitment to further scaling our content refinery. We continue to grow and invest in critical content. For example, within our Content and Technology Solutions business, our cloud-based real-time solutions are gaining traction with the launch of ticker plants in Europe and Asia and our recently announced relationship with BMLL for enhanced tick history.\nThe connectivity of our data powers hyper-personalized solutions that puts key information and analytical tools in the hands of investment professionals, enabling them to generate alpha across all market conditions. FactSet is an essential partner for our clients as they advance their digital transformations to increase efficiency and be more competitive. These transformations are critical, and clients are prioritizing investments in technology and data to drive performance, giving us further confidence in the resilient nature of our business.\nTurning to our performance for the quarter. We continue to see strength in ASV growth across all our regions. The Americas remains the biggest contributor, with organic ASV growth of 8.5%. And growth was diverse across firm types driven primarily by higher retention in banking. Private equity and venture capital clients also drove growth with Cobalt, a leading portfolio monitoring solution, plus the workstation securing client wins.\nOrganic ASV growth accelerated to 8.8% in EMEA, marking the region's strongest Q1 in recent history and the seventh quarter of increasing LTM growth. Performance was driven by higher retention among asset managers, asset owners and banking. Asset managers also saw a higher expansion across the product portfolio. And we also continue to see healthy demand for our wealth solutions, with Advisor Dashboard driving key wins.\nFinally, in Asia Pacific, we delivered organic ASV growth of 11.1%, driven primarily by expansion among asset managers and new business wins with asset owners. However, we also experienced headwinds in the region from macro factors, including regional COVID policies, which resulted in slower decision-making among clients.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results. We recognize the uncertainty in the market and are closely monitoring the macro environment for any signs of weakness. As we head into the start of calendar 2023, we expect to get a clearer picture of our second half as client budgets are finalized.\nUsing our downturn playbook as a guide, we are focused on disciplined expense management. And later in the call, Linda will share the actions we've proactively taken.\nFactSet maintains a long-term view of our strategy, and we will continue investing to sustain growth. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. And as such, we are reaffirming our guidance.\nI'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThanks, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we reported high single-digit organic ASV growth and double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue and adjusted diluted EPS. I'll now share more details on our first quarter performance.\nConsistent with our definition of organic revenues in ASV, we exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CUSIP Global Services when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. We will, however, provide some specifics on CGS so you can continue to understand its performance as part of FactSet. Beginning March 1, 2023, the first anniversary of the CGS acquisition, it will be included in our organic results as a component of our CTS business. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release.\nWe grew organic ASV plus professional services by 8.8%. As Phil stated earlier, this is a strong start to our fiscal year as compared to our typically lower revenue first quarter. Our performance reflects increased demand for our content and solutions, higher retention and continued expansion. We saw strength in the workstation for banking, key client wins with our enterprise solutions. And our subscription-based ASV continue to support value-based pricing.\nGAAP revenue increased by 18.9% to $505 million for the first quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 8.3% to $460 million. Growth was driven primarily by CGS and our Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory solutions.\nAll regions saw notable growth. From our geographic segments, on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was at 7.6%; EMEA grew at 7.2%; and Asia Pacific came in at 14.9%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 10% in the first quarter to $333 million.\nLet me now review our expenses based on our primary cost buckets. Starting with people, our expenses grew 4% year-over-year, primarily due to increased salary expenses for existing employees and higher stock-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue, this was 572 basis points lower year-over-year, demonstrating our continued focus on achieving a sustainable balance of investment in our talent and productivity.\nNext, real estate costs decreased by 21% year-over-year driven by the rightsizing exercise we performed in fiscal '22. As a percentage of revenue, this was 181 basis points lower year-over-year.\nThird, technology expenses increased this quarter by 11% driven by increased cloud spending. As a percentage of revenue, growth was 51 basis points lower year-over-year.\nAnd finally, third-party data content costs decreased by more than 12% year-over-year driven by our continued focus on financial discipline and data governance. As a percentage of revenue, growth was 156 basis points lower year-over-year. While this is a good result for the first quarter, we expect the annual rate to grow at 5% to 6%, in line with the outlook we gave at our April 2022 Investor Day.\nCompared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin increased by 517 basis points to 34.1%, and our adjusted operating margin increased by 471 basis points to 38.3%. Improvement was driven by higher revenue, lower personnel costs as compared to revenue, and lower content and real estate costs. These expenses were offset by higher technology expenses and costs related to the integration of CGS.\nRegarding our first quarter margin, I want to remind everyone that our first quarter margins tend to be seasonally higher than in subsequent quarters. While we've had a strong first quarter margin performance on both a GAAP and adjusted operating basis, we remain committed to balancing investment in our business with returning value to shareholders. As such, we continue to anticipate 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion for the full fiscal year 2023. Further, we expect our fiscal 2023 adjusted operating margin to be between 34% and 35%. This means we anticipate that margins will likely be lower in the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2023. You will find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 380 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 450 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. On a GAAP basis, SG&A was 140 basis points lower year-over-year as a percentage of revenues and 20 basis points lower on an adjusted basis.\nMoving on. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13.4% compared to last year's rate of 10.2%. Our higher rate's primarily due to higher pretax income and an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate from 19% to 25%, which will continue for the foreseeable future. GAAP EPS increased 26.2% to $3.52 this quarter versus $2.79 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 22.8% to $3.99. Both EPS figures were driven by higher revenue and margin expansion and were partially offset by increased interest expense and a higher tax rate.\nAs noted in our press release, adjusted EBITDA increased to $200 million up 38.2% from the same period in fiscal 2022. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was about $89 million for the quarter, an increase of 37.8% over the same period last year. This was due to higher net income, partially offset by increased capitalization costs related to internal use software.\nBefore moving on, I want to provide additional financial housekeeping items to help with modeling. First, CGS continued to perform well, adding $3 million in incremental ASV for the quarter. We expect it to grow in the mid- to high single digits. As a reminder, we will update guidance next quarter to include CGS. Once it is included as part of our organic results, we will no longer report on CGS separately.\nNext, interest expense for the quarter was $16 million. For the full year, we expect to end fiscal 2023 with interest expense of about $66 million. As a reminder, we paused share repurchases to prioritize debt repayment following the CGS acquisition. As such, no additional shares have been purchased since the first quarter of 2022. As of the end of November 2022, our weighted average diluted share count was 39 million shares.\nMoving on to the bonus accrual. Given our performance so far, we expect the bonus pool for fiscal 2023 to be about $100 million. Our operating income benefited from the strength of the U.S. dollar versus major currencies we hedge. However, we expect exchange rates to be volatile throughout the year, so the impact will fluctuate. As a reminder, 95% of our revenue and most of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nNext, we ended the fiscal quarter with capital expenditures of about $18 million, up $9 million from the prior year period. This was driven by increases in capitalization as well as technology expenditures. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we expect an increase in CapEx this fiscal year to be about $68 million at the midpoint as we move to our hybrid cloud strategy, increased focus on capitalization and consolidate our offices in Paris as part of our real estate strategy. And finally, we expect our dividend program to continue delivering value to shareholders. Fiscal 2022 marked 23 consecutive years of growth, and we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.89 on December 15.\nOur ASV retention for the first quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 13% compared to the prior year driven by corporate wealth and private equity and venture capital clients. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, reflecting the stickiness of our content and digital platform.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. We continue to pay down the term loan related to the acquisition of CGS. In the first fiscal quarter, we made another planned prepayment of $125 million, bringing our gross leverage ratio down to 2.7x from the initial 3.9x level when we financed the CGS acquisition. Following our next planned prepayment of $125 million in the second fiscal quarter, we expect to be within our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x. The strength of our net income and adjusted EBITDA has allowed us to move faster than expected to reach this target.\nAs a reminder, while we may make minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants during this time, we do not intend to resume our share repurchase program until at least the third fiscal quarter.\nNext, I'd like to discuss our downturn playbook. As Phil mentioned, we are still experiencing supportive end markets, and FactSet has historically fared well during periods of volatility. Should anything change, our downturn playbook gives us levers to reduce our operating expenses by 2% to 3% or $24 million to $36 million. Given market uncertainty, we have proactively implemented parts of our downturn playbook to protect margins and prioritize investments. Actions taken to date include limiting travel to client engagement and essential business needs, revisiting our real estate footprint and focusing on the continued reduction of third-party content costs. In addition, we are also monitoring our open positions to ensure focus on roles that are essential to our business.\nFinally, we've restructured our cloud budget as part of our hybrid cloud strategy, which will use both cloud and on-premise computing to run our core platforms. This change will save more than $20 million over the next 5 years, including $7 million this fiscal year.\nIn closing, we are confident in our ability to navigate the changing market conditions. While it's still early in the fiscal year, we have confidence in our pipeline as we look ahead. And as stated before, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023.\nWith that, we're now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to FactSet's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Kendra Brown. You may begin.\n\nKendra Brown\n\nHead of IR, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides, as well as a replay of today's call, will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statement and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kendra, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our strong fourth quarter and full year results. We ended fiscal 2022 with organic ASV plus professional services growth of $158 million, accelerating nearly 200 basis points year-over-year to over 9%, topping the high end of our guidance. We achieved annual revenue of $1.84 billion and adjusted EPS of $13.43 with both metrics also above the high end of our guidance range.\nOur strategy to become the leading open content and analytics platform is resonating with clients and driving our strong performance as we continue to gain market share. We saw growth across fund types, with corporates, private equity and venture capital firms, wealth managers, hedge funds and banking continuing their trend of double-digit organic ASV growth. Specifically, we saw improved retention with most clients this year with further growth coming from better price realization. Our investments in content and technology supported both stronger retention and expansion as well as significant acceleration in new business.\nYear-over-year buy-side and sell-side growth rates have increased by 200 and 180 basis points, respectively. On the buy side, the success of our portfolio life cycle products has been key to our expanded footprint with institutional asset managers. We continue to capture more of our addressable market by increasingly connecting our analytics, content and delivery capabilities across the front, middle and back office.\nFiscal 2022 was not only a strong financial year for us but also a milestone year for FactSet. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with CUSIP Global Services, issued our inaugural senior notes with investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and Fitch, joined the S&P 500, and advanced our sustainability efforts with the commitment to the Science Based Targets Initiative and the 2040 net zero emissions goal. In addition, we continue to expand our content and technology offerings with several key partnerships.\nIt also marked the culmination of our 3-year investment plan. Our foresight to invest in content and technology is paying dividends, accelerating top line growth by over 400 basis points since 2019. These investments fueled the largest content expansion in FactSet's history.\nToday, we have deep sector coverage for 8 sectors. We are making strides in our private market strategy with private company coverage across our content refinery, workflow solutions for private equity and venture capital firms, and cohesive connected workstation integration. We expanded our ESG content through the acquisition of Truvalue Labs and now partnered with more than 45 other ESG providers to aggregate a comprehensive set of data and solutions. And in wealth, our market-leading workstation, Advisor Dashboard and portfolio analytics tools are helping advisers work more efficiently while driving new business wins for FactSet.\nWe also invested in and accelerated our digital transformation. Our digital platform is a competitive differentiator, enabling clients to access our content and analytics via open, modern solutions. We are now a preferred partner for clients on their cloud migration journeys.\nOur acquisition of CUSIP Global Services aligns very well with the strategy and is a natural extension of our content refinery capabilities. The performance of CGS has exceeded our expectations with the integration progressing well, and we see opportunities to expand further by innovating and building new products. While early on in these efforts, we are currently exploring new business opportunities to extend CUSIP identifiers to additional entities.\nWe continue to invest in our people, helping us retain the best talent and stabilize retention even in this competitive market. We've embraced a hybrid work model that trusts our employees to select the work paradigm that allows them to be their most productive selves. We've invested in technology for home offices to ensure all employees, regardless of location, have setups that facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We've instituted global wellness days to give employees time to reconnect and charge. And we've also seen an increase in traveling and in-person engagements as our leaders encourage employees to meet one another and clients face-to-face wherever possible.\nAnd we've invested in compensation. To combat the effects of inflation, we've proactively increased salaries for critical roles and extended participation in our bonus and equity pools. Headcount increased year-over-year, thanks to our recruiting team, who did an amazing job of backfilling critical open positions and sourcing new talent to support our investments.\nWe also progressed as a firm with diversity, equity and inclusion. Central to our culture is the commitment to hiring and supporting talent from diverse backgrounds and experiences. With the addition of Kate Stepp as our Chief Technology Officer, women now comprise half of our executive leadership team. That's just one example of our success, and an achievement that makes us proud.\nAs we enter our next phase of investments, our focus remains the same: Scaling up our content refinery to provide the most comprehensive and connected set of industry, proprietary and third-party data for the financial market; enhancing the client experience by delivering hyper-personalized solutions so clients can discover meaningful insights faster; and driving next-generation workflow-specific solutions for asset managers, asset owners, the sell side, wealth management, private equity venture capital and corporate clients.\nWe're committed to investing in our people and our products and have invested about $40 million or about 360 basis points of margin in this effort during fiscal 2022. These investments are split pretty evenly between people and products and will ensure the continued healthy growth of FactSet's revenue. As we move forward, we will continue to take the same strategic approach to our investments, investing at a similar pace for FY '23 while delivering on our commitment to margin expansion. This includes the continued build-out of deep sector data, real-time, ESG, private markets and wealth data as core parts of our content strategy. In addition, we will continue to invest in our digital platform and in our people.\nThe connected nature of our content and products gives us continued confidence in meeting our medium-term outlook of 8% to 9% organic ASV growth, adjusted operating margin of 35% to 36% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11% to 13%.\nTurning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, ASV plus professional services grew 9.3%. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 21%, driven by both organic revenue and contribution from CGS. And adjusted EPS increased almost 9% from the prior year period. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin decelerated slightly year-over-year to 31.5% primarily due to higher personnel expenses and technology costs.\nThis quarter's strong performance was driven by continued expansion in Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory. New business growth also accelerated as we added small and medium wins as well as some notable larger wins, including the expansion of our relationship with Raymond James. This win reflects the significant investments we have made on the wealth management side, where we are recognized for having market-leading products.\nNow looking across our regions. We continued to see broad-based organic ASV growth over the last year. The Americas continue to lead ASV performance, contributing more than half of fiscal 2022's total ASV growth and surpassing $1 billion in total ASV. In the Americas, we grew organic ASV by 9% over the past 12 months. Research & Advisory and Analytics & Trading performed particularly well this quarter, with strength from our banking, wealth, private equity and venture capital clients and asset managers.\nIn EMEA, our organic ASV growth accelerated to 8% this quarter with strength across the product portfolio. Specifically, growth was driven by Analytics & Trading wins at asset managers, combined with capturing Research & Advisory and CTS opportunities at banks, wealth managers and corporate partners.\nIn Asia Pac, we saw organic 12% ASV growth driven by Analytics & Trading with particular strength from asset managers and owners. Growth from wealth managers in the region also accelerated driven by higher retention.\nNow turning to our businesses. Research & Advisory was the largest contributor to our organic ASV growth this year with a growth rate of 9% driven by banking, wealth and private equity and venture capital firms. We saw diverse wins from the workstation with new products such as Advisor Dashboard and Cobalt's portfolio monitoring capabilities gaining traction. We increased Research & Advisory workstation users by 12% this quarter versus a year ago with growth across both the sell-side and buy-side clients. ASV growth from sell-side clients was 13.8%, reflecting increased price realization, strong seasonal hiring and increased wallet share from our solutions.\nAnalytics & Trading ended the year with an impressive 10% organic ASV growth rate, demonstrating continued momentum in our portfolio life cycle strategy. This quarter marks 6 consecutive quarters of accelerating LTM ASV growth for analytics. We saw an uptick in larger wins, driven by portfolio reporting and performance, with gains among asset managers across all regions being led by the middle office. Performance and analytics professional services also contributed to this acceleration. As we look ahead, we believe demand for our market-leading analytics, expanding asset class coverage and leading technology, on- and off-platform, will continue to drive growth.\nFinally, CTS grew organic ASV by 11% with wins across asset managers and partners being key contributors. We saw strength in core company data, data management services, benchmarks and security data. In the fourth quarter, we saw several ESG wins with continued client growth. Real-time also gained traction with our all-cloud solution appealing to clients looking to reduce costs.\nIn summary, I'm proud of our fourth quarter and full year performance and the results of our 3-year investment plan. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to weather volatile markets. We are entering fiscal 2023 in a position of strength as our clients recognize the value of our solutions. Our fiscal 2023 guidance reflects our ongoing confidence in the business, and Linda will provide more detail shortly.\nI want to wrap up by thanking our incredible FactSet team. We couldn't have achieved the strong quarter and year that we did without them. We have the best team in the business and remain committed to attracting, retaining and developing this top talent.\nI'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail and take you through our fiscal 2023 guidance.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I join Phil in congratulating FactSetters for an outstanding fiscal 2022. As I approach my 1-year anniversary as CFO, I'm excited by everything we've been able to accomplish together. Our 9% organic ASV growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and 20% adjusted diluted EPS growth, not to mention our largest acquisition, investment-grade ratings and successful financing, are a testament to the hard work of our talented teams. I look forward to continuing to work across the organization in fiscal '23 to build on FactSet's history of strong performance and returning value to shareholders.\nOur growth rate for organic ASV plus professional services beat the high end of our guidance range due to our investment in product and excellent execution by our sales team. Retention moved the needle here, with higher price increases across a larger base of clients, reduced erosion as demand for our products increased across client types, and successful cross-selling opportunities. Full year revenue also exceeded the high end of our range with help from CUSIP Global Services.\nAdjusted operating margin was in line with the higher end of our range. Our margin increase was driven by effective expense control in the core business as well as the addition of the CGS business, resulting in 500 basis points of margin expansion. Our decision was to reinvest about 360 basis points of this margin growth back in our people and products while allowing the margin for shareholders to rise about 140 basis points. As Phil stated, we are committed to balancing investment at a similar pace for the next few years while delivering our commitment to margin expansion.\nFinally, we generated solid earnings, exceeding the top end of our guidance range, through strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and operating leverage.\nLet me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we're pleased to report the acceleration of organic ASV plus professional services and revenue. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that consistent with our definition of organic revenues and ASV, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CGS when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. However, we will provide some specifics on CGS so you can continue to track its performance. As Kendra noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release.\nWe grew fourth quarter organic ASV plus professional services by 9%. This increase reflects momentum across our product portfolio. With current levels of market volatility, we see higher demand for our products as clients focus on driving alpha as well as finding efficiencies.\nFourth quarter GAAP revenue increased by 21% from the prior year period to $499 million. Growth was driven by our Research & Advisory and Analytics & Trading solutions and CGS. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions during the last 12 months and deferred revenue amortization, increased 10% to $453 million over the prior year period.\nWe saw organic ASV acceleration across all workflow solutions in each of our regions. For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth over the prior year period for the Americas was 9%, EMEA at -- was 8% and Asia Pacific at 18%.\nTurning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses grew 25% year-over-year to $367 million, impacted by several charges incurred during the period. First, this includes the recognition of $13 million in intangible asset amortization related to CGS in the fourth quarter. As we spoke about last quarter, this intangible asset amortization will be a recurring charge.\nAlso, we saw a higher bonus pool in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance. In the fourth quarter, our bonus accrual was $37 million, bringing the total bonus pool to $111 million for the fiscal year. As previously stated, we invested $40 million in people and product this year. This is also consistent with commitments we made at Investor Day to continue to grow these buckets to sustain growth. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we expect a similar level of investment.\nGiven these expenses, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 240 basis points to 26.5% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin saw a slight decrease of 10 basis points year-over-year to 31.5% driven by higher personnel expenses, increased technology expenses and transactional foreign currency impact.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 50 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 130 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. Primary drivers include higher technology and content-related expenses, including expenses related to our shift to the public cloud, as well as amortization of intangible assets and other costs associated with CGS.\nWhen expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 169 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 142 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The increase is primarily driven by growth in compensation, comprised of higher salary expenses for existing employees, higher bonus accrual in line with stronger ASV performance and higher stock-based compensation expense as we distributed equity more broadly throughout the organization.\nMoving on to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 10.3% compared to last year's 14.7%. This was primarily due to lower pretax income and a tax benefit related to finalizing the prior year's tax returns.\nGAAP EPS increased 2.3% to $2.69 this quarter versus $2.63 in the prior year, primarily due to higher revenue and lower taxes, partially offset by higher interest expense and margin compression. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 8.7% from the prior year to $3.13, largely driven by higher revenue, offset by the impact of higher interest expense from FactSet's investment-grade senior notes and outstanding term loan.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased to $158.5 million, up 16% year-over-year. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $136 million for the quarter, a decrease of 20% over the same period last year, driven by higher working capital, which includes the timing of estimated tax payments and deferred revenue movements related to CGS.\nCUSIP Global Services exceeded expectations, adding $6 million in incremental ASV since the close of the acquisition on March 1, 2022. In Q4, CUSIP's diverse asset class coverage partially offset a weaker issuance market with significant year-over-year gains in time deposit CDs and private placements.\nIn the fourth quarter, our ASV retention remained above 95% and our client retention improved to 92%, highlighting the continued and stable demand for our solutions. Compared to the prior year, we grew our total number of clients by 17% to more than 7,500 clients, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. Our user count grew 12% year-over-year, growing to almost 180,000, primarily driven by sales in our Research & Advisory solutions, particularly amongst wealth management users.\nAnd turning now to our balance sheet. We continue to progress on the prepayment of the term loan related to the acquisition of CGS. In the fourth quarter, we made a planned prepayment of $125 million, bringing our gross leverage ratio down to 3.1x from the initial 3.9x level when we financed the CGS acquisition. We expect to make 2 more payments of $125 million in each of the next 2 quarters, enabling us to reach our gross leverage target of 2x to 2.5x in the second half of fiscal 2023.\nAs a reminder, while we may continue minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants during this time, we do not intend to resume our share repurchase program until at least mid-2023. Lastly, we would like to remind investors that we increased our regular quarterly cash dividend in the third quarter for the 23rd consecutive year. The increase was 8.5% for a per share dividend of $0.89.\nTurning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2023. We are guiding to incremental growth of $150 million to $180 million for organic ASV plus professional services. The midpoint of this range represents a 9% increase, reflecting continued momentum in our business and our commitment to our medium-term outlook. Please note that CGS is not included in our organic ASV guidance at this time, given that it will not impact organic ASV until the last 2 quarters of the 2023 fiscal year.\nWe expect adjusted operating margin of 34% to 35%, with the midpoint providing 60 basis points of margin expansion, which aligns with our medium-term outlook of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion each year.\nFinally, we expect adjusted EPS of $14.50 to $14.90, representing almost 10% growth at the midpoint. Given our outperformance in fiscal 2022, we are still on track to deliver 11% to 13% EPS growth over the medium term.\nWe are confident of our ability to continue to grow in the face of market uncertainty. Our subscription model, diverse product portfolio and enterprise solutions make us a stable long-term investment.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2023, growth will be driven by improved retention. We expect 2/3 of our top line acceleration to come from existing clients with low double-digit expansion offset by normal erosion plus increases in price realization. In the past, the majority of our growth came from cross-selling. However, given the incremental improvement in pricing this year, we anticipate the split will be more even between the 2. We expect the balance of growth will come from new business with continued growth in wealth, private equity and venture capital firms as well as corporates.\nOur continued investment in technology and content should drive growth in new markets and cross-selling opportunities for existing clients. Drivers include continued commitment to the digitization of our platform. Kate Stepp, our new CTO, is taking a fresh look at our digital strategy. Example areas of focus include scaling the use of cognitive technologies, expanding our API program and driving improved capabilities and productivity in our use of the public cloud.\nNext, continued evolution in our content refinery. As discussed previously, we plan to make direct investments toward deep sector, real-time, private markets and ESG. Development of these content sets are intended to drive retention and expansion across firm types. And finally, workflow solutions for the front office, wealth manager and private equity and venture capital firms will be key.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our performance in fiscal 2022. As we spoke about during Investor Day, we are seeing the benefit of our strategic investments and we feel we have a long runway ahead of us. We believe we are strategically placed to deliver on our targets for fiscal 2023 as well as our medium-term outlook. While we acknowledge the uncertainty in the macro environment, we believe that our focus on investing in our people, content and technology will continue to drive growth over the longer term.\nAnd with that, we're now ready for questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host, Kendra Brown, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nKendra Brown\n\nHead of IR, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Third Fiscal Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risk of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kendra, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our strong third quarter results as we delivered another exceptional quarter with double-digit ASV growth. As we enter our fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, we are building on our momentum and are well positioned for the year-end. Given this outlook, we are guiding to the high end of our previously discussed financial ranges, except for the tax rate, which will be at the low end of the range. Linda will speak more about this in a moment.\nOur organic ASV plus professional services growth accelerated to 10% in the third quarter, with strength across all workflow solutions and regions. Growth was primarily driven by analytics with success globally from asset managers and asset owners as well as large partnership wins and increased demand from wealth management firms.\nOur sales and client-facing teams continue to outperform, increasing the pace of our top line progress. We saw acceleration in year-over-year growth from all client types, reflecting our success in building the leading open content and analytics platform. We once again saw the continuation of double-digit growth in banking, wealth, hedge funds, corporate clients, partners and private equity and venture capital funds.\nStronger retention and accelerated expansion drove demand for our content and digital solutions for existing clients. And for new business, growth was driven by our workstation with solid performance in the Americas and EMEA, and continued small and medium wins across all regions. Adjusted EPS increased 38% from the prior year period given our ASV growth and disciplined expense management. Our third quarter adjusted operating margin also expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 36.6%. About 2/3 of this margin expansion came from the addition of CUSIP Global Services, or CGS, while the remaining 1/3 came from our core business. Our fourth quarter pipeline continues to look strong, providing a tailwind for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\nOur third quarter performance is the result of intense focus on the strategic initiatives we showcased at Investor Day, scaling our content refinery, delivering next-generation workflow solutions and enhancing the client experience with an open platform and hyper personalization. These key differentiators drive top line growth and enable us to capture more of the addressable market.\nFactSet's open platform powers the portfolio life cycle with market-leading solutions. Our portfolio analytics and trading products for the front and middle office drive broad-based growth on the buy side. Ongoing investment in the front office is paying dividends as the momentum and acceleration of our front office capabilities continues to grow. These multi-asset class portfolio analytics continue to see healthy client demand, thanks to our differentiating buy-side attribution and risk capabilities.\nOur content refinery is driving growth in Content and Technology Solutions, or CTS, our off-platform business. As you may recall from Investor Day, this business delivers proprietary and third-party content to clients in several ways, including data feeds, APIs or increasingly, the cloud. FactSet suite of off-platform solutions offers our clients the flexibility to decide where and how they will consume their data. And our ability to concord or connect data is a real differentiator.\nAs clients increasingly want to consume data programmatically, we're expanding our robust suite of data management and workflow solutions. CUSIP Global Services, a CTS business component is a great example of this expansion. I'm pleased with the performance of the CGS team, its integration with FactSet has gone very well. Together, our teams are working to expand the business, focusing on private companies, ESG, digital assets and issuance trends. These opportunities are promising, but several will take time, so it's still early days. Linda will discuss CGS' performance in more detail later in the call.\nIn the current volatile market, our investments in content and workflow solutions put us in a resilient position. Our clients clearly recognize the value of our diverse product portfolio, and we are committed to increasing the pace of these investments for the next few years. We will continue to invest in our content refinery, building on our offerings in ESG, deep sector, real-time, private markets and wealth. And as we discussed at Investor Day, our investments drive client demand and will be a driver of growth in the years to come.\nLooking across our regions, we saw broad-based acceleration across all our markets. The Americas continues to be the biggest contributor to growth with organic ASV growth accelerating to 10.1%. This was driven by research and advisory with the workstation driving new business, especially among corporates, Expansion was driven largely by wins at wealth clients.\nIn EMEA, ASV growth accelerated to 8.3%. Workstation sales drove growth with asset managers and banks. We saw increased ASV capture in the region due to the international price increase, better price realization and workstation expansion. New business also contributed to growth, driven by increased workstation sales within wealth funds.\nAsia Pacific's performance remained strong with ASV growth at 14.3%, driven by demand from asset managers and vested owners. We saw higher retention and expansion among existing clients across many countries. Both CTS and analytics contributed to growth with higher expansion with asset owners and asset managers, respectively.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance. We continue to invest in our business and platform, which is paying off, giving us good momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we are confident in our strategy and ability to navigate volatile markets. We remain committed to the medium-term outlook we shared at Investor Day of 8% to 9% ASV growth, 11% to 13% EPS growth and 35% to 36% adjusted operating margin.\nFactSet has a proven history of growth in volatile markets. Our subscription-based model provides stability and fosters client retention. We're prepared for potential downturn scenarios with specific levers to reduce our spending if necessary, even as we continue to invest in our business, which Linda will discuss in more detail. Ultimately, our open platform, content refinery and personalized workflow solutions will continue to set us apart.\nUnderpinning all our efforts is our incredible team. Our culture is a key differentiator in this competitive environment, and we're committed to attracting, retaining and developing top talent. Like many of you, our leadership team has increased our in-person interactions. It's been great to meet with clients again, have visitors in our offices and engage with FactSetters face-to-face. We provide flexibility for our employees with our hybrid work model, which has been very well received, and I'm proud of the work our team does every day to deliver on our goals and constantly improve our products.\nI will now turn it over to Linda to take you through the specifics of our Q3 performance.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report continued acceleration in our top line with double-digit growth year-over-year in revenues, organic ASV and adjusted diluted EPS. I'll now share some more details on our third quarter performance.\nConsistent with our definition of organic revenues and ASV, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CGS when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. We will, however, provide some specifics on CGS so you can track its initial performance as part of FactSet. As Kendra previously noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics to comparable GAAP figures is included at the end of our press release.\nWe grew third quarter organic ASV plus professional services at 10% year-over-year. This acceleration reflects disciplined execution of our sales pipeline and pricing plans. In addition, investments in content and workstation functionality continue to support both retention and better price realization. For example, our third quarter international price increase contributed $10 million in ASV, an increase of $3 million or 30% from last year.\nThird quarter GAAP revenue increased by 22% from the prior year period to $489 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions during the last 12 months and deferred revenue amortization, increased 10% to $442 million over the prior year period. Growth was driven by our research and advisory and analytics solutions as well as by the acquisition of CUSIP Global Services. All regions saw robust growth, benefiting from acceleration in all 3 workflow solutions. For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth over the prior year period for the Americas was 7%, EMEA at 13% and Asia Pacific at 24%.\nTurning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses grew 39% year-over-year to $392 million impacted by several charges incurred during the period. First, as previously discussed, we have been resizing our real estate footprint to match our hybrid work model. This quarter, we recognized $49 million in impairment charges. While we will continue to evaluate our real estate needs, this initiative is largely complete. We do not anticipate similarly sized real estate impairment charges in the quarters to come. Also in the third quarter, we incurred $12 million in onetime acquisition costs related to the CGS acquisition. In addition, we recognized $13 million in acquisition-related intangible asset amortization during the quarter. Going forward, this intangible asset amortization will be a recurring charge.\nGiven these charges, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 956 basis points to 19.9% compared to the prior period. Adjusted operating margin increased by 500 basis points to 36.6% compared to the prior year, exceeding our guidance on this measure driven by lower compensation expenses, lower tech and content costs and lower facilities expenses. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 582 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 792 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation and lower technology and content-related expenses, including our ongoing shift to the public cloud. When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 536 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 292 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers of the increase include CGS acquisition costs, increased employee compensation expense and higher bonus accrual.\nMoving on to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 12.2% compared to last year's rate of 11.9%. This was primarily due to lower projected levels of income before income taxes and a tax provision reduction related to the lower rate compared with the 3 months ended May 31, 2021. GAAP EPS decreased 26% to $1.93 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year primarily due to real estate impairment charges, acquisition expenses and higher interest expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.\nAdjusted diluted EPS grew 38.2% from the prior year to $3.76, largely driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $173 million up 30% year-over-year. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $177 million for the quarter, an increase of 45% over the same period last year. A key driver for our increased cash flow is the acquisition of CGS, which has performed well since closing on March 1.\nSpeaking of the CGS acquisition, we are now 100 days in, and CGS is tracking ahead of plan on all fronts. Its financial performance was robust in Q3, with both sales and margins exceeding expectations. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we're on track to realize $5 million in ASV in fiscal 2022 from CGS. It is a resilient business with steady top line and good cash flow even in a potential market downturn.\nWhile CGS' issuance fees are more sensitive to market activity, these fees make up only 15% of CGS' revenue. Functional integration of the CGS operation is well along, and we now expect to exit our transition services agreement ahead of schedule.\nOur ASV retention for the third quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 19% compared to the prior year, driven by the addition of more corporate and wealth clients. user count increased by more than 2,000 since last quarter, thanks to an increase in research and advisory users. Year-over-year, user count grew by 12%. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our subscription revenue model.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. On March 1, we issued our inaugural investment-grade senior notes. These notes comprised $500 million of 2.9% 5-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.45% 10-year senior notes. At the same time, we entered into a new credit agreement, updating our term and revolving credit facilities. We're pleased that our fixed rate senior notes are well priced, given recently increasing interest rates.\nIn addition, as you may recall, we've hedged 80% of our total debt from floating rate exposure for 24 months, largely protecting us against rising interest rates. And as we have said before, we're proud of our investment-grade ratings. In the third quarter, we made a planned prepayment of $125 million on our term loan, bringing our gross leverage ratio down to 3.5x from the initial 3.9x level when we acquired CGS. We expect to make 3 more payments of $125 million in each of the next 3 quarters, enabling us to reach our gross leverage target of 2 to 2.5x in the second half of fiscal 2023. During this time, while we may continue minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants, we do not intend to resume our share repurchase program until at least mid-2023.\nLastly, we'd like to remind investors that we increased our regular quarterly dividend in the third quarter for the 23rd consecutive year of dividend increases. The increase was 8.5% for a per share dividend of $0.89.\nNext, I'd like to discuss planning for our downturn playbook scenario. First off, it's important to note that FactSet remains committed to top line growth supported by our investment plans. We would expect to maintain these investment plans even under a downside scenario. As Phil mentioned, historically, FactSet has fared well in volatile markets as our subscription business model provides stability even in challenging times. With more than 40 years of consecutive revenue growth, we've successfully navigated several down cycles. We significantly outperformed the S&P 500 on revenue, operating income and EPS in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In fact, in 2008 and 2009, FactSet EPS was positive, while S&P 500 EPS was double-digit negative. That said, its sound financial practice to be prepared for all scenarios.\nAs part of this planning, we've identified 2% to 3% of our $1.2 billion in operating expenses or $24 million to $36 million that we could potentially reduce to maintain margins in the event of a severe downturn. First, if we experience lower ASV, our bonus pool would adjust accordingly per our preestablished performance targets providing the largest share of expense reductions. Lower ASV would also proportionately reduce variable third-party data and content costs.\nLastly, we could potentially reduce T&E expenses through virtual engagement. This is a planning exercise we will undertake quarterly in order to rebalance resources given prevailing market conditions. To confirm this exercise is just scenario planning.\nAs we look to end our fiscal year on August 31, FactSet is on track for a strong finish. Given our performance this quarter and robust pipeline, we reaffirm our previously communicated guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect growth at the upper end of the previously provided ranges for most of the metrics in our annual outlook. The exception would be the effective tax rate, which is expected to fall at the lower end of the previously communicated range. As a reminder, CGS is not included in our organic ASV guidance. However, as we discussed earlier in the call, we expect CGS to contribute approximately $5 million in ASV in fiscal 2022.\nAll in all, we are encouraged by the demand for our content and workflow solutions. Our investments continue to drive growth in our digital platform. Our sales team continues to provide excellent execution, and we're continuing to improve our price realization. Although there is uncertainty in the macro environment, we believe our diverse product portfolio and stable financial position will serve us well for the longer term.\nWith that, we're now ready to take your questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the call over to Kendra Brown, SVP, Investor Relations.\n\nKendra Brown\n\nSVP of IR, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be posted on our website at the conclusion of this call, and a replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nCEO & Director, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kendra, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I begin my remarks, I want to remind everyone that we are hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, April 5, both in person in New York City and via live stream. We look forward to sharing more about our business strategy, growth initiatives and long-term financial outlook at this event. To register, please see our website. You may also reach out to Kendra for additional details. I hope to see many of you there. .\nI'm pleased with our impressive second quarter and first half results as we executed on our pipeline and built on our strong momentum from Q1. Our organic ASV plus professional services growth accelerated to 9% in the second quarter led by growth in workstations and analytics and are capturing higher price increases in the Americas.\nWe also saw several large renewals, which further affirm the strength of our offering and investments in both product and content. Our strategy continues to drive top line growth and allows us to capture more share of wallet with our clients.\nGrowth this quarter was strongest among our buy-side clients with the biggest contributions coming from asset managers and wealth clients. All buy-side firm types experienced accelerated growth in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across all workflow solutions. We continue to see double-digit growth from banking, wealth, hedge fund and corporate clients along with private equity and venture capital funds and partners. Retention was a key driver this quarter with our investments in content and technology continuing to resonate.\nNew business accelerated globally, led by the Americas. While we had success with larger deals, we also continue to see a higher volume of small- and medium-sized client wins. We're pleased that our performance resulted in a 20.2% increase in adjusted EPS from the prior year period and an adjusted operating margin of 33.7%, exceeding our prior guidance.\nOur third quarter looks solid with a strong pipeline for our second half. As such, we are adjusting our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect 8% to 9% ASV growth, expansion of our adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS of $12.75 to $13.15. Linda will walk you through the details shortly.\nOur focus remains the same, to build a leading open content and analytics platform. This quarter, we continued to scale our content refinery and enhance the client experience with personalized workflow solutions. FactSet's open ecosystem and cloud-enabled components provide flexible tools that enhance efficiency and connectivity across the front, middle and back office.\nOur cloud program allows us to meet clients where they work with innovative products and technology. Partnerships with enterprise software providers are expanding the reach of our platform. And earlier this month, we announced a strategic partnership to integrate Portware, our leading execution management system with BlackRock's Aladdin platform to provide clients with a seamless experience across multi-asset portfolio management and trading execution.\nOur content refinery also continues to drive meaningful ASV as we build out our offering, focusing on ESG, data for wealth, private markets and deep sector. We see the acquisitions we've made over the last year, helping accelerate growth. And we are seeing continued success with private equity and venture capital clients with our integration of Cobalt on track. We closed several new cobalt deals over the quarter and our Cobalt plus workstation offering is expanding our pipeline to new sales.\nDeep sector was a driving factor in key sell-side renewals this quarter as client dependency on content and workflow solutions grows. We also see new business traction with corporates as our deep sector offering expands our addressable market. Fiscal year-to-date, there have been over 30 key releases across 7 sectors, including integration of BTU Research into document search.\nOur investment in our digital platform is paying dividends. Advisor dashboard is driving expansion and new business with its next best action capabilities, providing tangible efficiencies and insights for wealth advisers. Hyper-personalized workflow-driven solutions fueled by our content, differentiators in the market and provide continued greenfield opportunities. Goran Soco, Rob Robie and Jonathan Reid will provide more details on our products and initiatives to drive growth for our research and advisory, analytics and trading and CTS workflow solutions as part of Investor Day.\nI'd like to officially welcome the CUSIP Global Services team to FactSet. I've had the pleasure of meeting many members of the CGS team and look forward to continuing to build on their industry-leading brand. In addition, we are very pleased with our new relationship with the American Bankers Association, whose leadership we met with earlier this month in Washington, D.C. We look forward to a strong and collaborative relationship with the ABA.\nThe addition of CGS aligns well with our multiyear strategy to invest in content and technology. This is a natural extension of our content refinery as we significantly expand the breadth and reach of our robust suite of data management solutions. We look forward to sharing more in CGS at our upcoming Investor Day. As part of the CGS transaction, we came to market with our inaugural $1 billion senior notes offering. I'm very pleased that this offering received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and Fitch, reflecting the strength and consistency of our financial health.\nLooking across our regions, we saw broad-based strength across all workflow solutions. The Americas continues to be the biggest contributor to growth with ASV growth accelerating to 10% over the quarter. Growth was driven by improved retention and new business wins with corporates, wealth, private equity and venture capital firms and asset owners. The region also benefited from higher price increases across all phone types.\nASV growth accelerated to 8% in EMEA, making the fourth straight quarter of consistent improvement. We saw strength from wealth and asset managers among existing clients and expansion among our banking clients. We also saw new business wins with corporates and asset owners.\nAsia Pacific also had another strong quarter with ASV growth of 14%. Asset managers, in particular, can see driving growth across the region with broad-based strength across our product portfolio with both new and existing clients.\nIn summary, I'm proud of our first half performance. Our momentum continues as we successfully invest in technology and develop our content refinery. Our pipeline continues to build as we head into the second half of our fiscal year driven by demand from both new and existing clients.\nWhile we see some choppiness in the market today, FactSet has a proven history of growth in volatile markets. Our products and solutions are mission critical for our clients, particularly in times of market volatility as we help the investment community generate alpha and identify the next best action faster. We continue to see increased demand for our solutions, which reinforces our conviction that our strategy is delivering and will continue to deliver sustainable growth.\nWe believe that our culture and performance-driven mindset creates a strong advantage both in how we serve our clients and as we focus on attracting, retaining and developing top talent in this competitive and dynamic environment. We dedicated to investing in our people and giving our teams the support and flexibility they need to navigate and be successful. I could not be more proud of our constant team effort to deliver personalized, innovative and efficient solutions for our clients.\nOur focus on our people is part of a larger effort to become a more diverse, thoughtful and impactful organization. We're committed to sustainable growth for our clients, employees, investors and communities and the principles underlying this commitment are built into all aspects of our business.\nWe recently released our fiscal 2021 sustainability report which highlights our progress, including creating a sustainability plan and signing the UN PRI and Global Compact, among others. The report also outlines our commitments to the future. I really encourage you all to take a look.\nFinally, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine is top of mind for us, just as it is for the rest of the world. During these troubling times, the safety and security of our team is a top priority. In light of the situation in Ukraine, FactSet has decided to discontinue all commercial operations and delivery of products and services to clients inside Russia, and we are terminating all contracts with vendors in Russia. These actions will not have a material impact on our business or client relationships.\nLinda will now take you through the specifics of our Q2 performance, Linda, over to you.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Phil, and hello to everyone on the call. We've been extremely busy in the second quarter as we work to close the acquisition of CGS, went to market with our investment-grade inaugural senior notes offering, negotiated our new credit facility, and put the finishing touches in place for our April 5 Investor Day. I joined Phil in recognizing the efforts put forth each day by our FactSet employees. Our teams have done amazing work. It has been an exciting time in the company's evolution.\nAs you have seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report acceleration in our top line with double-digit revenue growth and high single-digit growth in organic ASV plus professional services. I will now share more details on our second quarter performance.\nConsistent with our definition of organic revenues and ASV, we will exclude any revenue and ASV associated with CGS when reporting organic-related metrics for the 12 months following the acquisition date. As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services at 9%, an acceleration reflects increased demand for our digital solutions, disciplined execution on our sales pipeline and pricing strategy, and a supportive external environment with tailwinds from the capital markets and overall economic growth.\nBenefits from our investments in both content and functionality are validated by our annual price increase. For example, in the Americas, our price increase yielded $21 million, $7 million more than the prior year. While an inflationary environment did enable us to raise the rate of price increases above our historical 3% to 4%, we also realized these price increases across a wider base of clients.\nGAAP revenue increased by 10% to $431 million for the second quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization also increased 10% to $431 million. Growth was driven primarily by our research and advisory and analytics solutions.\nAll regions saw notable growth. For our geographic segments on an organic basis, revenue growth for the Americas was at 10%, EMEA grew at 9% and Asia Pacific came in at 14%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in analytics. Increases in research and advisory solutions provided an uplift in the Americas, while content and technology solutions was a key driver in EMEA. GAAP operating expenses grew 12% in the second quarter to $308 million, impacted by several changes incurred during the period.\nAs we spoke about during the last quarter, most of our employees are working in a hybrid or remote capacity. This quarter, we recognized $10 million in impairment charges as we focus on rightsizing our real estate footprint to reflect our new work environment. We anticipate additional impairment charges related to real estate in Q3 of this year as we exit office space in various locations worldwide. We expect that this charge will be about $45 million in the third quarter.\nIn addition to real estate impairment costs, we also incurred $5 million in transaction expenses related to the CGS acquisition. Given that we closed the acquisition on March 1, the first day of our fiscal third quarter, there will also be additional charges for the acquisition in the third quarter. We expect this charge to be about $14 million in the third quarter.\nCompared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 100 basis points to 28.6%, and our adjusted operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 33.7%, exceeding our guidance on this measure. Improvement was largely due to lower employee compensation expense as a percentage of revenue and lower content costs as a percentage of revenue.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 365 basis points lower than last year on a GAAP basis and 295 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation as a percentage of revenue and lower technology-related expenses as a percentage of revenue, including our ongoing shift to the public cloud.\nWhen expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 470 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 185 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include real estate exit costs, expenses related to the CGS acquisition, increased employee compensation expense and higher bonus accrual.\nMoving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 10% compared to last year's rate of 16%, primarily due to lower projected levels of income before income taxes and a tax provision reduction related to the lower rate. GAAP EPS increased 13.6% to $2.84 this quarter versus $2.50 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 20.2% to $3.27. Both EPS figures were largely driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of this press release.\nAs noted in our press release, EBITDA increased to $146.8 million, up 11.1% from the same period in fiscal 2021. We are now providing this EBITDA measure to allow added transparency for both our equity and debt investors.\nAnd finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $110 million for the quarter. A decrease of 15% over the same period last year, primarily due to higher estimated tax payments.\nOur ASV retention for the second quarter remained greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the addition of more corporate private equity and venture capital and wealth clients. This quarter, we reached the milestone of more than 7,000 clients for the first time in our history. Our client retention remains at 92% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our product portfolio and exceptional execution by our sales teams.\nAs announced in our January CGS investor call, we suspended our share repurchase plan for the remainder of fiscal 2022 to prioritize excess cash flow for repayment of debt to reduce our leverage levels. We are committed to reducing our outstanding debt as quickly as possible. We are therefore extending our pause on share repurchases, at least until the second half of fiscal 2023. While we will continue to make minor share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of stock option grants, we expect to keep our share count relatively flat throughout this period. Finally, we anticipate our dividend program will continue to deliver value to our shareholders as it has in the past.\nGiven our outstanding first half performance, the acquisition of CGS and visibility for the rest of the year, we're updating our guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect organic ASV growth of $130 million to $150 million, raising our midpoint by more than 8% from our initial 2022 guidance set in September of $105 million to $135 million. This represents an acceleration of our organic growth rate of 7% from fiscal 2021, reflecting our conviction in FactSet's continued momentum.\nWhile CGS is not included in our organic ASV guidance, we expect CGS to contribute about $5 million in ASV in fiscal 2022. Keep in mind that our August 31 fiscal year means that we are only including CGS results in our last 2 quarters of this fiscal year. We will see an expected deceleration in GAAP operating margin given our real estate footprint rationalization, restructuring costs from Q1 and M&A costs. However, CGS is accretive to our adjusted operating margin as reflected in the 50 basis points of planned margin expansion from the previous midpoint.\nAnd finally, we expect adjusted EPS to be $12.75 and to $13.15 versus the $12 to $12.30 we had stated previously, raising the midpoint by 8.6%. We will be providing medium-term goals for growth and margin at our Investor Day, but we will not be addressing this longer-term view on today's call.\nAs we look to the second half of the fiscal year, we are encouraged by our pipeline, by our ability to capture value-based pricing, demand for our digital platform, and high retention with our client base. We have confidence in continuing to see a higher volume of deals with a healthy mix of large, medium and small wins.\nHowever, the macro and geopolitical environment remains more uncertain than usual. We do not know the full impact of the Ukraine conflict, which could potentially lead to a recession scenario. In addition, there's variability in our bonus pool, the exercise of stock options and our tax rate, all of which can make a significant difference in our financial results. Even with these challenges, our guidance reflects the belief that we are well positioned for the future.\nAnd with that, we're now ready for your questions. Operator?"

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FactSet First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Toomey, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Toomey\n\nHead of Investor Relations, FactSet\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we referenced during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions. The call is scheduled to last for one hour. To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. You may re-enter the queue for additional follow-up questions, which we will take if time permits. Before we discuss the results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide two. Discussions on this call may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today, both of which can be found on our website at investor.factset.com. During this call, unless otherwise noted, relative performance metrics reflect changes as compared to the respective fiscal 2025 period. Joining me today are Sanoke Viswanathan, Chief Executive Officer, Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer, and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer. I will now turn the discussion over to Sanoke.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we've started our fiscal year. We are reporting strong ASV growth and healthy operating margins coming from broad adoption of our solutions and some key customer wins. ASV grew 5.9% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, and adjusted diluted EPS is at $4.51, up 3% year-on-year. Thank you to all our FactSetters for your focus and commitment to delivering for our clients. We are not just growing. We are winning in the places that matter. Across firm types and in the areas that we've prioritized, clients are choosing FactSet over alternatives because of the strength of our platform. I will share just three examples. We secured a significant mandate with one of the largest warehouse breakaway teams, who made FactSet a requirement in their transition to an RIA consolidator.\nThis matters because these breakaways preserve enterprise revenue at the originating firm while adding ASV at the consolidator. At a global top 10 bank, we displace an incumbent for pricing and reference data feeds, supporting their global reference data hub and multiple use cases in Asia-Pacific. We secured a major win with one of the world's largest investment managers, who chose FactSet Vault as their analytics book of record and our managed services for performance to unify holdings across all their subsidiaries into a single database and deliver flexible reporting across their institutional and retail businesses. These wins illustrate the resilience and scalability of our client franchise, driving ASV growth and expanding our reach into adjacent markets, opening new sources of growth. I'm pleased to announce that we are increasing our share repurchase authorization from $400 million to $1 billion.\nThis decision reflects our conviction in the strength of our balance sheet and in the intrinsic value of our shares, delivering shareholder returns while maintaining the flexibility to invest for long-term growth. Over the past three months, I've focused on the fundamentals of our business, including our people, clients, and products, assessing what we do, where we lead, and where we need to improve. I've spent time with employees in all our major global offices, reviewing our operations, product development, and execution, and met with over 80 institutional clients across North America, Europe, and Asia. I've engaged with technology and content partners on ways to develop new solutions for our clients, and I've spoken with shareholders about their priorities and how we can better articulate our strategy and milestones.\nWhat I've heard from everyone reaffirms the core strengths that set FactSet apart and why we believe we will continue to be indispensable to clients. First, our connected data. Clients rely on FactSet for high-quality, trusted content curated over decades and enriched by deep domain expertise. Just as important, our ability to standardize and reconcile third-party sources with speed and precision is market-leading, thanks to advanced integration, concordance, and entity resolution capabilities. And clients access our data where and how they need, through APIs, secure low-latency feeds, Cloud Connectors, and MCP servers, without sacrificing performance, security, or reliability. Second, embedded workflows. FactSet isn't a portal. We are built into the data pipes and decision engines that run global finance. Every day, clients on average make 8.4 billion FactSet Query Language requests for spreadsheet use, evidence of deep reliance on our platform for valuation, screening, and other decision-making.\nOur Portfolio Analytics power mission-critical workflows: performance, attribution, risk, and reporting, where accuracy, explainability, and governance matter most. We are interested to view the activity, exposure, and risk across client books and deliver analytics that inform decisions throughout the investment lifecycle. Third, best-in-class client service. We combine technology with human expertise. Our consultants are trained on the workflows of asset managers, banks, and Wealth Advisors. They operate as partners to our clients, designing implementations, guiding transitions, and enabling user adoption and personalization. In a recent meeting I had with the head of Wealth Management at a top 10 global bank, the first thing he said to me was how much he appreciated his FactSet consultant and mentioned her by first name and said she had just been in his office before I showed up. Fourth, broad and deep distribution. We have reach across the industry.\n100,000 Wealth Advisors, roughly three-quarters of the top global investment banks, and 95 of the top 100 global asset managers rely on FactSet. The average age of our client relationships is more than 16 years, so it is clear that this trust runs deep. These strengths reinforce each other in a flywheel to make FactSet essential today, and increasingly so as AI and agentic capabilities become more prevalent in daily work. Success in enterprise AI comes from trusted, high-quality data, secure integration with models and workflows, and detailed knowledge of how financial institutions operate. This is where FactSet stands out. Over 90% of our ASV is composed of proprietary client-facing solutions and proprietary data and tools enriched by subject matter experts. Examples include Portfolio Analytics, FactSet Performance Solutions, CUSIP, Revere, and FactSet Fundamentals.\nWe are one of the few companies trusted to integrate external and private data at scale without compromising safety, supported by strict data ownership, entitlements, and security compliance. While other providers offer conversational interfaces or point solutions, they lack the governed data foundations and enterprise integration that regulated financial workflows require. And because FactSet is so deeply integrated across Buy-Side, Wealth, and Banking clients, we are uniquely positioned to navigate their technology architecture, consolidate fragmented data environments, and tailor AI and agentic solutions to their needs. As the flywheel compounds, it directly translates into faster product innovation, deeper user personalization, and measurably better client outcomes. Let me give you a sense of the volume running through this flywheel today. Just in the past 30 days, our clients have actively used a million custom models and screens to run data queries, pulling hundreds of billions of data points.\nWe believe AI will accelerate this flywheel. We are still in the early stages of enterprise AI adoption, but to give you an example, across the AI products we launched earlier this year, we've seen broad-based user adoption with sequential growth of more than 45%. Put simply, AI doesn't replace what makes FactSet essential. It amplifies it. While I'm pleased with our first quarter results and the positive feedback from our clients, there's much work to be done to unlock the tremendous value within our business. This starts with decisive action to accelerate growth and operating leverage. I have three priorities: driving commercial excellence, delivering productivity improvements across the business, and solidifying our long-term strategy to ensure FactSet is positioned for sustainable growth. First, commercial excellence. With our strong products and trusted client relationships, we are sharpening sales execution to reinvigorate top-line growth.\nWe are driving new business development, using analytics to prioritize new prospects, scaling marketing to increase awareness and recall of flagship solutions, putting AI tools to work for personalized outreach and follow-up, and managing the pipeline with rigor. We are simplifying packaging and pricing, organizing clients by persona and usage, refreshing bundles with data-driven insight, fully integrating recent acquisitions, pricing to value, and tightening controls to reduce leakage. We are focusing on improving retention and expansion within our clients, aligning customer success metrics and incentives to drive adoption and upsell, using analytics to flag and reduce churn, and elevating our strategic dialogue at top clients. And we're modernizing sales operations, raising performance expectations, applying best practices to sales incentives, reducing friction with advanced forecasting and analytical tools, and instituting robust productivity tracking. We are executing with urgency while laying the groundwork for world-class commercial performance.\nFor example, we've changed sales incentives to better align them with the outcomes we want: new business, cross-selling, and upselling. This has already led to faster sales motions and a richer pipeline. My second priority is driving productivity gains. I've initiated a disciplined review of our technology, processes, and client service model to identify and act on opportunities to reduce complexity, apply modern tools, and streamline operations. We've initiated a program of transforming and consolidating our legacy technology applications onto a centrally managed modern platform. This is expected to significantly reduce complexity for our developers and deliver efficiencies. One tool having immediate impact is our new Text-to-Formula agent, which reduces routine support traffic, resolving requests in an average of six seconds versus minutes for a human interaction. On average, approximately 35% of formula support questions daily are now handled by this agent.\nBy offloading these repetitive requests, our service teams are able to focus on higher-impact client work. Each interaction also adds to a reinforcement learning loop that continuously improves product performance. Leveraging new data modeling, visualization, and programming approaches, our data operations team is now able to ingest third-party data at 10 times the speed, vastly expanding our content coverage without adding headcount. These examples illustrate the scope of opportunity there is to drive productivity and efficiency across the organization. My third priority is solidifying our long-term strategy to ensure FactSet is positioned for sustainable growth. I'm engaged closely with the board and my management team to shape FactSet's future, and we are holding ourselves accountable to make hard decisions around allocating resources and capital. I know you're all eager to hear my thoughts about medium-term guidance.\nIt's too early for me to comment on that, but I want you to know that I'm working actively on new growth initiatives anchored on content and technology innovation that drive real competitive differentiation and deliver durable ASV growth and operating leverage. As I reflect on my first few months, I have greater conviction in FactSet's position today because the structural advantages are real, the client reliance is deep, and the opportunities to expand our impact are tangible. We have three clear priorities that we are acting on with urgency to drive a culture of excellence across the company. Over the coming quarters, we'll continue to provide more details as we execute against these priorities. Now, I will hand over to Helen to discuss our Q1 performance in more detail.\n\nHelen Shan\n\nCFO, FactSet\n\nThank you, Sanoke. And great to be here with all of you on this call.\nOur Q1 FY 2026 results mark a solid start to the year, driven by disciplined execution and deepening traction with our clients. For the first quarter, organic ASV growth accelerated sequentially to 5.9%, an increase of $6.6 million. Expansion with our existing clients was the key component, with strong demand in trading, Workstations, and markets data across the Buy-Side, Banking, and Wealth. With that, let's review the quarterly results in more detail, starting with our regional performance. In the Americas, organic ASV grew 6% this quarter, driven by Asset Managers and Wealth. Within this region, we are seeing increased demand for portfolio lifecycle solutions and AI-ready data, both from existing hedge funds and new ones coming on board. In EMEA, organic ASV grew 4% this quarter. We had higher expansion with performance solutions and improved retention overall, both helping to offset some softness we experienced with asset owners in the region.\nIn Asia-Pacific, organic ASV grew 8%, up from 7% last quarter. Middle office solutions and AI-ready data were the key drivers here, as we're seeing regional firms increasingly investing and modernizing their tech stacks to compete globally. Now, turning to our results by firm type. On the Institutional Buy-Side, we delivered 4% organic ASV growth with broad-based strength across firm types. Asset managers led the way with multiple seven-figure wins and improved expansion with existing clients. Growth here was fueled by our trading solutions, performance, and managed services. Hedge funds accelerated again this quarter with strong demand for our data capabilities and front-office offerings. Asset owners' growth was softer this quarter as we lapped the large Outsourced CIO win in Q1 last year. We do continue to see selective opportunities where our performance solutions and client relationships are gaining traction.\nIn Wealth, we delivered 10% organic ASV growth in Q1, displacing incumbents with six-figure wins spanning Workstations, pricing reference data, and analytics. This quarter, off-platform solutions, data feeds, APIs, and analytics integrations comprise an increasing portion of expansion. This validates our land-and-expand strategy as existing Workstation clients embed FactSet content into their broader technology stacks. In Dealmakers, organic ASV grew 6% year over year. Banking drove the majority of the growth as clients expanded their use of our data feeds, APIs, and off-platform solutions. Across our banking franchise, we are seeing higher net seasonal hiring driven by a strong M&A market globally. Corporates and PE/VC also contributed to growth with both new business wins and improved retention. Integrated solutions are resonating and driving expansion within existing clients.\nThis quarter, we are renaming Partnerships and CGS to Market Infrastructure to better reflect the exchanges, data providers, and market participants we serve. Organic growth was 7% with robust data demand and continued strong issuance activity. We're expanding our client base and deepening relationships. Client count grew to over 9,000, up 9% year over year, driven by Corporate and Wealth additions. Retentions remained healthy at 91% for clients and above 95% for ASV. Our user base is now approaching 240,000, with Wealth and Asset Managers leading user growth in the quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Turning now to our financial results. First quarter revenues grew 6.9% year over year to $608 million, or 6% organically excluding foreign exchange and M&A impact. Adjusted operating margin came in at 36.2% for the quarter.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $4.51, up 3% year over year, driven by growth in revenues and a lower share count, offset by a higher tax rate. Operating expense increased 9% year over year on an adjusted basis, with a few key drivers. People-related expense rose 15 million, or 7%, driven by higher annual merit increases and year-over-year lapping dynamics. Specifically, employees hired or acquired after Q1 of last year, including from Irwin and LiquidityBook, are now reflected in our full quarterly run rate. Sequentially, total headcount grew less than 1% in the quarter, concentrated in low-cost locations. Technology expense grew 13 million, or 23%, driven by higher internal-use software amortization and cloud expense. As we've discussed, we are concentrating investments in both growth and structural capabilities to expand our market leadership through product innovation. Our other expense categories remained well-controlled.\nThird-party content costs increased $4 million to support new data sets for research workflows, while real estate expense rose $2 million due to lease renewals and a return-to-office expense. For a detailed breakdown of our expense progression and reconciliations, please reference the appendix in today's earnings presentation. I will now walk you through our investment priorities, which remain consistent with what we've outlined last quarter. We're allocating roughly 2/3 to growth and 1/3 to our internal infrastructure. The growth investments are targeted across firm types. First, we are building a more differentiated data universe, including enterprise data such as real-time feeds, pricing and reference data, as well as our own deep sector content.\nSecond, we are deepening our client workflows, such as extending our strength on the advisory desktop into the home office functions for Wealth clients, broadening our managed services offering, and connecting the trade lifecycle through our modern EMS and OMS solutions. The structural investments are aimed to enable growth. First, we are upgrading our go-to-market tools and processes to accelerate our sales motion and increase activity levels. Second, we are modernizing core infrastructure: cybersecurity enhancements, AI-powered productivity tools, and performance-based incentives. These are intended to drive operational efficiency as we scale. These investments should strengthen retention and expand our opportunities with existing clients while positioning us to grow with new clients. To help fund these activities, we are executing on productivity actions Sanoke noted earlier, reallocating resources from maintenance to growth initiatives, managing headcount and third-party spend more rigorously, and implementing AI to automate routine processes.\nTogether, these actions should produce sustainable expense savings. On capital allocation, we maintain a balanced framework, but in our priorities, growth comes first. We are deploying capital into product development, go-to-market capabilities, and infrastructure modernization to drive future growth. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to pursue these investments while also returning capital to shareholders. We ended the quarter with a gross debt leverage ratio of 1.4 times, and our consistent free cash flow generation supports both our growth agenda and capital returns. With our financial strength as a foundation, we are also committed to shareholder returns. Earlier today, we announced an increase to our share repurchase authorization from $400 million to $1 billion. During our first quarter, we purchased approximately 478,000 shares, leaving $860 million of capacity under the program. This increased authorization reflects confidence in FactSet's long-term fundamentals.\nWe also paid a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share today to shareholders of record as of November 28th. In total, we've returned $554 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months through dividends and buybacks, and we remain committed to delivering strong returns while investing for growth. Let me finish with guidance. We are reaffirming our previously issued FY26 guidance across all metrics, both GAAP and adjusted. Clearly, Q1 was a solid start, and we are encouraged by continued client demand. This sets us up well to deliver on full-year targets. Looking ahead, our pipeline remains healthy, and we are confident in our ability to convert opportunities and successfully close on key renewals. With much of the year still ahead of us, we are maintaining a prudent and conservative approach to guidance.\nWe are focused on executing against these commitments and will provide updates as we gain additional visibility. On quarterly phasing, we expect Q2 operating margins to reflect the step-up in investment outlined earlier as we bring on headcount and technology resources. This is deliberate and keeps us on track for a full-year margin target. In summary, we achieved a strong Q1 with a healthy demand environment, disciplined investments in growth, and financial strength to deliver sustainable shareholder returns. Thank you for your time today. Operator, please open for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS Securities. Your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\n\nKelsey Zhu\n\nFinancial Information Technology Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I feel like recently there's been a lot of discussion around FactSet's competitive positioning versus AI startups. I'm actually more curious to hear your perspective on how FactSet is positioned amongst the Big Four data incumbents. I think everyone is investing in AI infrastructure. Everyone is launching new AI products, and FactSet is a smaller one of the bunch. So just curious to hear your strategy to maintain share or gain share within the incumbents.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThank you, Kelsey, for that question. I'll reiterate what we said earlier, which is that we are very confident, very, very confident in what we view as proprietary assets that we have.\nYou saw in the chart that both in terms of data as well as tools and analytics, what we bring to bear, there is a significant amount of capability that we bring that is not disruptible by others. At the same time, we also partner very actively with the full range of the AI ecosystem, from the hyperscalers to startups, and we view the distribution through those as complementary to our existing distribution. I'll just take a couple of examples and talk about how we think about our strategy. When you look at our Workstation, we view the Workstation as a channel that distributes our data, just like we distribute data through data feeds and through APIs. At the same time, as clients are starting to move into production workloads with AI, they demand security. They demand entitlements.\nThey want a container through which they can consume their AI in a safe and secure way, all of which the Workstation does and has been doing for decades. So what we are really seeing, and this is evident in the strong quarter you just saw and in the pipeline that we see, there is a huge amount of demand from clients, from our core existing clients, who have been through, I would say, months, if not years, of trialing and experimenting with different AI solutions, coming to us and asking us to be a consolidator of these solutions and really driving demand. And we've seen multiple five-year and seven-year contract renewals from some of our largest clients, where AI is a key component of what we are going to be delivering for them. And let me ask Goran to add a little bit more color to this.\n\nGoran Skoko\n\nChief Revenue Officer, FactSet\n\nYeah, Kelsey, just in terms of how do we stack up versus the established competitors, we feel strongly about our competitive position, robust position to take share. We keep investing in our content assets, and we are pleased with the progress of some of those that really are the key to taking share, especially if we have time in price reference data and things of that nature. Data solution was a big driver of the Q1 results. I hope that answers your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nFaiza Alwy\n\nManaging Director of US Company Research, Deutsche Bank Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Good morning. Sanoke, thank you for your detailed comments regarding your priorities. A few things stuck out to me regarding commercial excellence.\nYou talked about sort of simplifying pricing, packaging, pricing to value, and some of the changes around sales incentives. And it sounds like you're saying it's already led to faster sales motion and a richer pipeline. So we'd just love to hear a little bit more, sort of bring to life some of the changes that you have either already incorporated and the early results that you're seeing.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThanks, Faiza. Yes, we are actively at work on a whole set of levels across the entire sort of sales enablement and sales force effectiveness. Incentives was one of the first things we worked on in this last quarter, and we've really aligned our incentives across the board, certainly in sales, but even more broadly across the company, to focus on the motions that we are looking to achieve. So first, new business development.\nThere's real renewed vigor and energy with which we are attacking new business development all the way up and down the funnel, and we're seeing significant expansion in our top of the funnel lead generation coming out of that. The second area is obviously cross-selling and upselling, so driving retention and expansion in our core clients. This, we are seeing a big pickup, and the energy in our sales teams is palpable. We are seeing faster sales motion. It is definitely aided by the fact that our AI products are resonating, and there is an urgency in clients as well to move faster in terms of capturing the value from those products. And in terms of some of the other levels I spoke about, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We are investing in our systems.\nWe are applying more analytics to understanding where we are trending in terms of client usage of our products and being able to flag and ultimately reduce the risk of churn. So we see a good upside from this coming through in the future quarters. And certainly, the idea is to build a sustainable, long-term, sort of high-performance commercial engine.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, guys. Hopefully, you hear me now on this line. Seems like you are. Can you hear me? Sorry.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nYes, yes. All clear.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nAll right, good. Sorry. Tech difficulties today. All right.\nAnyways, I don't think this was asked when I disconnected, but the other question I'm getting related to AI a lot when it comes to you guys is also how the hiring picture is going to look for your customer base in the future, because obviously, not only you, but your customers are talking about using AI for efficiencies. And I think 50% of your business is still a desktop business. So maybe with your discussions you've been having with clients, where do you hear that the most? What client types do you think you can actually see some customer reductions in terms of the seats? And how do you stack up in those areas, meaning where do you see the biggest reduction in force, and how does this impact your kind of desktop-related businesses or cloud?\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThanks, Alex. Yeah.\nLook, as I said, I've met with dozens of clients now around the world and across all our firm types. Certainly, I'd say there's a huge amount of experimentation and testing out and piloting of various AI solutions. What we're seeing on the ground in terms of real commitment and commitment of the larger dollars, though, is to folks like ourselves. Ultimately, clients are looking for ways in which they can augment their FactSet solutions, and our own AI products are resonating. We are not seeing yet any real reduction in headcount, frankly, not even in banking, where there has been a significant amount of discussion about it. What we are actually seeing this season is a strong recovery driven by the M&A recovery more broadly.\nWe're actually seeing increased headcount, increased hiring of bankers, and by the way, increased usage of all of the digital tooling, including our AI products. So our banking AI products, for instance, have seen over 100% in terms of usage growth just quarter on quarter. So I actually think what is really likely to play out is that we are going to see consumption growth, which we are very well prepared for because of the way in which we are striking our contracts with clients, and an increase in headcount as well. Again, I don't have a crystal ball, but so far, we're not seeing any reductions.\nThere are certainly discussions about it, and there is an expectation that there will be greater efficiencies, but we are seeing those efficiencies, if they are already coming through, being put back into attempts to gain market share by our clients in our end markets.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.\n\nManav Patnaik\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just had a question on the slide you had on the margin impact for the 2026 investments. Just kind of following up, what is the cadence, I guess, by quarter we should be expecting on that 250 basis points gross investment? How much has done this quarter, for example? And then are these one-time investments, or should we anticipate 2027, 2028, etc., having more of these as well?\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nSo Manav, I'll take the second part of that question, and then I'll ask Helen to cover the cadence through this year. So just to recap the sort of the nature of our investments, we have a good chunk of investments going into foundational elements. And I'd broadly put the foundational elements into two types. We are investing in our sales incentives as well as broad incentives across the organization so that we can attract and retain top talent. And the second, we are investing in technology infrastructure, both cybersecurity as well as resilience for the critical infrastructure that we are providing for our clients, both very essential to the core business that we deliver. So these are strong foundational enablers that set us up well for future operating leverage and for scale.\nThe bulk of the investments then is growing into very specific targeted growth areas, both on the content side, so explicitly expanding our data sets, whether it's pricing and reference data, real-time data, deep sector data, and frankly, continuing to invest in the AI readiness of our data. And on the other hand, on deepening our workflows across the portfolio lifecycle, both in the Wealth space as well as in investing in areas like our trading and OMS and EMS systems. So these things, these investments all have clear line of sight into direct line demand. So we feel very good about this level of investment. And we are not planning to change this level of investment through the rest of this year. I think the idea is, we have a solid investment plan, and we expect that the benefits of this will play out in future years.\nAbout the longer-term investment path, that's linked intrinsically to our long-term strategy development, which we are working actively on. I will come back and share more about that in future quarters. So let me turn it over to Helen to hit the cadence for 2026.\n\nHelen Shan\n\nCFO, FactSet\n\nThanks. And thanks for that question, Manav. So we're pretty pleased with the progress we've made on our cost management program thus far. Those are the productivity benefits that we referred to earlier. And when we think about the full-year phasing, when we look at, for example, technology costs, which we would expect to continue to increase, amortization of capitalized software is increasing through the year, and that really reflects our prior investments. And then also, the full-year run rate from recent acquisitions are going to start to lap going forward as well. So those are things that are impacting the phasing.\nWhen we think about the strategic investments, they're really back half-weighted across three areas: the incremental headcount, software infrastructure, and then also professional services, which are really more largely one-time in nature. So we don't usually provide quarterly guidance, as you know, but you can sort of expect that similar pattern that we saw last year. That being said, Q4 can be impacted positive or negatively depending on our performance, which is what happened last year. But that's how I would think about the impact of margin over the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nShlomo Rosenbaum\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi. Thank you very much. I had a broader question just on the environment. It seems like during the quarter, the company took a step forward in the organic growth in each of the geographic units.\nWhat I'm trying to understand is how much of that is from the, maybe you're lighting a fire under people more over the near term in terms of closing some of the business and getting things done, and how much of it is that you're really seeing an improvement out there in the environment in general. I know that's not very hard to quantify it, but maybe you can give us some thoughts on what you're seeing with the environment versus how much of it is company-specific success.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nYeah. I'll ask Goran to comment on this and add to it. But let me start by saying that we're seeing very good positive sentiment across the board. There's high conviction we are seeing from our clients in our products and solutions.\nThe pipeline is certainly much stronger at this point in the year than it was this time last year. We're quite pleased with the sales cycle. We're seeing a very diversified pipeline across firm types, which is giving us confidence that we don't see any risk to any particular type of situation. Frankly, some of the initiatives we are undertaking internally are leading to better retention. To your question, it's a complementary situation where there's certainly a bunch of things we are doing, which is helping our own organic pipeline, both in terms of retention and expansion. The market environment is strong, and we see that in customer sentiment. There's lots of demand for new data products. There's expansion in the ways in which clients are looking at consuming our data and applying it to work.\nSo we're seeing growing demand from the technology offices of clients, data science teams, so teams that were traditionally not perhaps in front of a FactSet Workstation but are starting to consume our data in significant quantities across new channels, whether it is APIs, direct data feeds, Cloud Connectors, MCP servers, etc. Goran?\n\nGoran Skoko\n\nChief Revenue Officer, FactSet\n\nSo Shlomo, as Sanoke said, it's a little bit of both. So the environment is more positive, more constructive. But I think it's also the things that we are doing. Investments that we have made are resonating. So we have seen an improvement in retention in banking, for example. And I would attribute that to our investment in aftermarket research and deep sector, which is certainly helping. Our trading solutions are contributing significantly. So we are seeing better diversification across the product lines in terms of contribution. And then the client demand is increasing.\nWe have seen some positive impact from relaxation in regulations in China, and we are seeing deals closing pretty fast. And I think demand for our content is increasing in that region significantly. So it's well-diversified in terms of contributions, and we are pleased with the progress so far.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\n\n[Analyst] (William Blair)\n\nAnalyst, William Blair\n\nHi. Good morning. This is Tom Shaw for Andrew Nicholas. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could speak to how AI contributed, your AI product contributed to ASV growth in the quarter and kind of any clarity you could add on how it's driving new wins, displacing incumbents, or just helping retention. Thank you.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThank you for that question. As we said last time, we've stopped calling out our AI products separately as a line item.\nAnd candidly, it was because we are seeing AI just deployed everywhere. So across the board, when we look at our solutions that we're delivering both for the Institutional Buy-Side and Wealth Management, as well as on the sell side, we're seeing AI consumption just being a real complement and an accelerator. It's a real tailwind to the conversion of our core products as well. So it's definitely adding to the mix. And I'd say I'll point to adoption as probably the best way to describe the effect it's having on our clients. So just the AI products we launched in this year. So if you look at what we launched in the first quarter back in January, February, March, sequentially, they've been growing at a very nice pace.\nJust this quarter, we saw the growth rate and adoption of all of that at over 45% just quarter on quarter. We're just at the start of this journey. We are both investing in new products as well as continuing to distribute and expand these products. So we see it as a real tailwind for the overall business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nGeorge Tong\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. You talked about leaning into productivity initiatives like ingesting data better, modernizing your tech platform, and driving service team efficiencies. At the same time, you're investing in the sales and tech infrastructure, and that's causing operating margins to decline about 150 basis points for full-year fiscal 2026, just based on guidance. How do you think about balancing investments with your ability to drive margin expansion?\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThanks.\nThanks, George. The investments we are making are of two types. The structural investments we are making are going to help us in terms of operating leverage. So the example I gave about really organizing all our legacy applications into a new format where they are able to leverage a common technology infrastructure that is centrally run. This takes a lot of the toil away from our developers at the front end and puts time back in their hands, but they can focus on really cutting-edge product development, which then creates the sort of flywheel effect for us of being able to ship products faster. So that investment, the structural investments are key to driving operating leverage. The growth investments, as I said earlier, are directly aligned to client demand. We are investing in our content. We are investing in our delivery mechanisms and our workflows.\nAnd we are investing in AI, right? So the combination of all of this is going to directly resonate with clients, as it has, as you've seen in the quarter. And we see a strong pipeline throughout the year. So we're really balancing these two investments. And we see value from both, both in the short term, but even more so in the medium to long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nToni Kaplan\n\nResearch Analysts, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much. The organic ASV growth has been accelerating for the past three quarters, and it was better than I was expecting in this quarter. And so just based on the guide, it looks like you're expecting it to decelerate from the current level. And this is despite sort of the confidence and momentum, good pipeline, and the investments.\nAnd so I was just wondering, is this just conservatism, or is there something that you're seeing that would imply that growth slows towards the end of the fiscal year? Maybe it's the tough comp. Just wanted to understand what would drive the guidance or not to be a little bit higher, and sort of what factors might go into sort of getting to the low end of the range versus the high end of the range on organic ASV. Thanks.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThanks, Toni. We remain very confident, as we've said, in the strength of the pipeline. Having said that, it's really early in the year, and there is a significant amount of business to be acquired throughout the rest of the year. So we want to be prudent, and we are obviously remaining very focused on winning deals, executing well in the market.\nWe hope to come back in future quarters and continue to support the sort of growth trajectory that we have been on in the last three quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nJeffrey Silber\n\nBusiness and Industrial Services and Education Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThanks so much. I really appreciate. I think it was slide seven in your deck where you tried to calculate what of your products and services are proprietary versus non-proprietary. Can you give us a little bit of color how you came up with what exactly went in each bucket?\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nSure. Thanks, Jeff. As we show in the slide, the vast majority of our businesses are proprietary. I'll spend a couple of minutes just explaining how we've gone about the analysis. So as you can tell on the slide, 40% of our business is intrinsically linked to client proprietary data.\nWe bring our proprietary models, our analytics, our solutions to work on their data, which is obviously proprietary. We feed it back in terms of high-quality output that then feeds a number of downstream workflows. A good example is Portfolio Analytics. It's what we do with our advisor dashboards on Wealth Management advisors' desktops. Here, we are really supporting millions of portfolios of end clients that our advisors are managing and advising on, and we are enabling them to do their jobs better. So that's 40% clearly proprietary. The remaining 60% of the work we do and of our business is data that we distribute through multiple formats, the Workstation being a flagship channel, but we also deliver through APIs, through other feeds, and through more and more modern channels.\nWhen you look at the far right on that page, the 10% that we are really saying we are holding a high bar and saying that it's not proprietary, this 10%, we are labeling it enhanced and curated. You could technically access the core data from public sources. But as you can see on the page, there are some very strong branded products there with a high degree of client loyalty to FactSet. An example would be StreetAccount. An example would be Shark. It would be GeoRev. Even these are enhanced with a lot of FactSet methodologies and content and humans, for example, StreetAccount reporters who are working every day to deliver these services. But we are being intellectually very rigorous in saying these can technically be accessed through other sources because the raw data is publicly available, like news, and filings, and so on.\nSo that brings us to the 50%, what we are calling proprietary and enriched data and tools. So why do we say this is proprietary? This really is either because the data is proprietary, as in the case of CUSIP, or that the data is enriched significantly with our proprietary methodologies and know-how. I'll give you a very simple example. I mean, some of our strongest franchises, whether it's identifier assignment, benchmarks, normalized fundamentals, instrument-level cap structures, event-driven data, regulatory data sets, all of these, these are not just historical artifacts. We rely on ongoing skilled domain expert labor and proprietary methodologies that are applied to this every day, every minute, and often in milliseconds to actually deliver very high-quality structured intelligence to our customers. So examples are the Revere Business Industry Classification, right, our RBICS, which is the industry gold standard for industry classification.\nIt's our real-time exchange and pricing and reference data feeds. It's our private capital data on private companies. It's deep sector data. And obviously, our absolute flagship products are standardized and point-in-time fundamentals and estimates, which is the gold standard for fundamentals in the market.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nSurinder Thind\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Sanoke, I just wanted to kind of ask about kind of the idea around medium-term targets here as you work towards establishing them, and you think about the growth and the margins. What are some of maybe the key considerations you're exploring here? It just seems that with the pace of change, it's accelerating how things might look out two or three years. There's just a lot of uncertainty.\nSo would you be able to build a medium-term outlook that you can have confidence in?\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nAbsolutely, Surinder. This is our, as you looked at my priorities that I described earlier, is spending a lot of our time working on our strategy and our long-term vision. Of course, there's uncertainty in the marketplace. We like this uncertainty because we see the trend of opportunity in it. We are very well positioned to take advantage of the changing dynamics, the form factor changing, the addition of new content sets, opening up of new end markets. We are excited by the opportunity set in front of us.\nAnd our strategy is working the way we are developing it, which we'll, of course, come back and share in future quarters, is designed to find ways in which we can differentiate ourselves better from competition, from our traditional and new competition, and finding ways in which we can capture new vectors of growth and continue to sweat our existing assets and capabilities better and capture more upside from those. So I do feel very confident that we can come back with strong medium-term guidance in the future quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nJason Haas\n\nSenior Business and Information Services Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question.\nBased on some of the comments, it sounds like you're selling more AI-ready data through feeds and APIs, and presumably, your clients are going to be using that data with their own AI solutions. I think there's a thought out there that this would be a first step to potentially those clients not needing as many Workstation subscriptions. So I'm curious if you could comment on that. Then it's related to, I want to also ask, are you able to talk about how the margins on that feed business compares to the margins when you sell a Workstation product? Thank you.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet",
    "content2": "Thanks, Jason. So a couple of things.\nThe distribution of high-quality data that is now ready for AI consumption, so, i.e., models can really read the data and make sense of the data because of all the enrichment we've done with the metadata to it, is certainly a growing opportunity for us. We don't see it as a risk of cannibalizing our existing channels for a couple of reasons. As I said earlier to one of the earlier questions, we see the Workstation as a channel. It's a flagship channel, but ultimately, it's a channel for distribution of the content. And we are well prepared with any new channel of consumption. And therefore, we will meet our clients' demand where they want us to meet them. If it is an MCP server, we'll deliver data through the MCP server. If it is the Workstation, it is the Workstation.\nWhat we ourselves expect is that there's going to be more of both because anytime we see digital adoption scaling, as we've seen historically with other sort of technology trends, 1+1=3, there's even more demand at the end markets to consume the data in multiple different ways. Now, the other point I'd like to point out about the Workstation is the Workstation is deeply, deeply embedded in the workflows of our clients across the sell-side and the Buy-Side. So it's not just a portal where you look at the data. It is deeply intertwined in the investment workflows that our clients pursue. And we see the components of consumption through other channels actually complementing it and being ultimately brought back into the workflow that the Workstation is anchoring today. So that's how we see this evolving.\nAnd of course, we are well positioned in whichever way the market evolves. As far as the margins are concerned, we see strong margin opportunity on both sides. The workstation is a high-margin product, but so are these data feeds through other channels. And we continue to anticipate that both will continue to deliver very strongly for us on the operating margin front.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Wurtzel\n\nSenior VP, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on sort of private market data offering. And there's been a lot of, I think, investment in the space from yourself and your peers as well in terms of increasing the magnitude of data that you have on private companies.\nJust wondering how you sort of feel about your competitive position with your private markets data and if that is an investment priority for you over the course of the next 12 months here. Thanks.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThanks, Scott. Private capital is clearly an area that we cannot ignore, and we've been investing in it already now for multiple years. We have a very strong position now in the quality of our data sets that we're delivering. We cover over 10 million companies in our private company database at a very high-quality level, similar to the quality standards I talked about earlier when we talked about our proprietary data. If you think about how we operate and how we aim to support the client base, we think of it from the pre-deal stages through the deal-making stages and into the post-deal sort of spectrum of activities.\nObviously, because of our strong position in Portfolio Analytics on the Buy-Side, we have a very privileged position to support clients as they look at their total portfolio views across public and private assets. And the data that we are today providing on private capital is enabling our asset owner clients, our asset manager clients, and insurers to look at the risk in a normalized fashion, which historically has been very difficult. And with some of the market events that are happening, there is a growing need for risk assessments at a much greater frequency, which is playing well to our strengths in the space.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Motemaden\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just ask. It sounded like the pipeline's good. The environment is getting more constructive.\nSome of the changes to sales incentives and product investments have been gaining traction. But could you just help me reconcile that with the only seven net new clients that were added this quarter?\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nSorry, can you repeat that question a bit? We didn't hear it clearly.\n\nDavid Motemaden\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. It sounded like the pipeline is good. The environment is constructive for your clients. The product investments have been gaining some traction. When I look at the net new clients this quarter, it's up by only seven. That's the lowest amount of net new clients adds you guys have had in quite some time. So, it seems like retention is solid, but the new logo adds might be lagging a little bit. So I was wondering if you could just explore that a little bit.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nSure, sure. Thank you.\nThe first, I would say, the client count is broadly in line. It tends to be a little bit lower in the early part of the year. We are not worried about the client count number itself. We actually have a very strong pipeline of new business opportunities. And if you look at our ASV growth from new business, it's actually very, very strong. So I wouldn't worry much about that client count number. And we actually see a really strong pipeline on that front through the rest of the year. And maybe, Goran, you can add a little bit to that.\n\nGoran Skoko\n\nChief Revenue Officer, FactSet\n\nYeah, David, and if you look at historically, Q1 is a slower in terms of net client growth. But I will just reiterate what you're saying. We're seeing lots of positivity.\nWe're seeing strong pipeline and really expect to deliver for the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Sanoke Viswanathan for closing remarks.\n\nSanoke Viswanathan\n\nCEO, FactSet\n\nThank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We are still early in this next chapter, as you can see, for FactSet. And while there's much work ahead of us, the opportunity in front of us is very clear. Our structural advantages give us a strong foundation, and we are mobilizing with urgency to execute against these priorities. You will hear more from us in the coming quarters as we move forward with speed and discipline. I want to thank once again all our FactSetters for your continued commitment to our clients. Operator, that ends today's call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.\nYou may now disconnect."

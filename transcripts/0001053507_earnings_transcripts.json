Welcome to the American Tower Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Spencer Kurn, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSpencer Kurn\n\nAnalyst, New Street Research LLP (US)\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm Spencer Kurn, Head of Investor Relations for American Tower. Joining me on the call today are Steve Vondran, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties described in American Tower SEC filings, and results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?\n\nSteven O. Vondran\n\nExecutive Vice President and President, U.S. Tower Division, American Tower Corp.\n\nThanks, Spencer. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call.\nAs you can see from our published results, we completed a great quarter that delivered double-digit growth in attributable AFFO per share as adjusted. Leasing activity remained robust across our tower and data center businesses that was complemented by near record services revenue. These top line trends, combined with focused execution of our strategic initiatives, have enabled us to increase our guidance for the year across all of our key consolidated metrics.\nAt the midpoint of our revised guidance, we now expect to deliver attributable AFFO per share as adjusted growth of approximately 7%. Net of FX headwinds and financing costs, our outlook implies attributable AFFO per share as adjusted growth of approximately 9%, which reflects the fundamental strength of our core operating model.\nBefore turning the call over to Rod to review our detailed financial results and updated outlook, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the industry backdrop and what it means for American Tower. The past few months have been interesting and active time in our industry, with [ spectrum ] moving between key players and signals of a more consolidated U.S. carrier market. During my 25 years at American Tower, I've navigated many instances of carrier consolidation of spectrum deals, and our experienced team has a strong track record of delivering market-leading solutions that meet the needs of our customers while enhancing our strategic positioning.\nAlthough each transaction has been unique, there's been one consistent trend: the tower industry benefits when its customers become healthier. Financially strong customers tend to invest more heavily in their networks to keep pace with demand for mobile data consumption, which in turn requires greater demand for our best-in-class tower portfolio.\nDemand for mobile data, the backbone of our business model, continues to rise at a torrid pace. In the U.S., the most recent CTI survey showed that mobile data consumption in 2024 increased approximately 35% year-over-year for the third straight year, driven by growth in mobile customers, 5G-enabled devices, usage per device and fixed wireless access. To put this into perspective, at this pace, mobile data consumption would continue to double every 2 to 3 years.\nExperts believe that the rapid growth in mobile data consumption will require a doubling in overall network capacity over the next 5 years, which in turn will require a significant increase in cell sites that benefit our tower business. We, therefore, remain quite optimistic about the opportunities that this industry landscape presents, even before considering likely tailwinds from AI-driven mobile data demand.\nWe're also paying close attention to developments within satellite-based networks. We have a firsthand view through our Board representation at AST SpaceMobile and regularly evaluate satellite capabilities with engineers and technology consultants. Our assessments are deeply rooted in data and firmly endorse the view that satellite-based networks will remain complementary to terrestrial towers due to the capacity and economic constraints inherent to the satellite model. And these challenges are only magnified when considering the evolving nature of wireless communication technology as growth in mobile data consumption compounds.\nIn the U.S., this demand continues to drive robust levels of leasing activity. Application volumes in the third quarter remained elevated and heavily weighted towards [ amendments ] but with a growing share of co-locations. On average, approximately 75% of our towers have been upgraded with 5G equipment. So there's still considerable runway for growth as carriers complete their 5G coverage rollouts and shift their attention to network quality with densification activity.\nWe also see positive trends across our other tower portfolios where data consumption has grown at a CAGR of roughly 20% to 25% since 2020. 5G mid-band coverage is still progressing and stands at an average of roughly 50% in Europe, 20% in Latin America and 10% in Africa, with emerging markets lagging developed markets in cell sites per capita. Our international customers, especially in our emerging markets, continue to invest in 4G and newer 5G networks, and we're well positioned to capture future upside as our less mature markets lease up over time.\nStrong industry tailwinds also continue to propel our data center business. This quarter, CoreSite signed record retail new leasing revenue and experienced healthy growth in our larger deployments as well, driven by strong demand for hybrid cloud and multi-cloud deployments and positive pricing actions amidst tight supply dynamics. We're also seeing significant new demand from early-stage AI-related workloads like inferencing, machine learning models and GPU as a service for Neo clouds. It's becoming increasingly important for AI workloads to be co-located with hybrid installations. Our CoreSite facilities are perfectly suited to this as they have a rich ecosystem of network and cloud interconnection coupled with purpose-built capacity designed to support AI and other high-density deployments with features like liquid cooling.\nAll of these positive trends in demand and pricing reinforce our expectation for CoreSite to achieve mid-teens or higher stabilized yields and to achieve these targets faster and with better visibility as pre-leasing and sales pipelines accumulate. I'm confident that American Tower is well positioned to benefit from these demand drivers across our tower and data center businesses. Our portfolio of assets is unmatched in quality, scale and operational excellence. And we focused our company around 4 strategic priorities to optimize long-term value creation: maximize organic growth, expand margins, allocate capital with discipline, and position our balance sheet as an asset.\nWe maximize organic growth as the best operator of towers and distributed real estate in the world. Our contractual and asset management expertise continues to deliver industry-leading organic growth while passing along superior service, operational benefits and efficiencies to our customers.\nWe expand margins by leveraging our global scale and world-class teams to drive cost efficiency. We've generated approximately 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion since 2020, and we see room for continued expansion as we streamline operations. We look forward to communicating more details on future efficiency initiatives as a part of our 2026 outlook presentation during our fourth quarter call.\nOur capital allocation philosophy optimizes long-term strander value creation. After funding our dividend, we evaluate internal uses of CapEx, inorganic opportunities, debt repayments and share buybacks against each other to drive the highest possible risk-adjusted returns for our business. This approach has recently prioritized developed tower markets and CoreSite to improve the quality of our earnings and durability of growth. And as you saw in our results this morning, it informed our decision to repurchase $28 million of shares since quarter-end.\nAnd our balance sheet, with an investment-grade credit rating and leverage now below 5x, which is the lowest among our tower peers, provides the cost of capital advantage and superior financial flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. Taken together, our strategic priorities are designed to deliver our goal of industry-leading AFFO per share growth.\nSince assuming the CEO role last year, I'm increasingly impressed by my team's ability to execute these priorities and deliver value for all of our stakeholders. And I'd like to thank our incredible employees for delivering yet another impressive quarter. I'm confident that our team will continue to expertly manage our best-in-class assets and provide unmatched service for our customers in the future.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our detailed third quarter financial results and updated 2025 outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Steve, and thank you all for joining the call. As you saw in this morning's press release, we delivered another strong quarter and raised our full year outlook. Before diving into our third quarter results and our revised full year outlook, I'll share a few highlights.\nFirst, total revenue grew nearly 8% year-over-year, driven by steady consolidated organic growth in the mid-single digits, another strong quarter of U.S. services contribution and double-digit growth from CoreSite. Second, adjusted EBITDA also grew nearly 8% year-over-year as strong revenue growth was complemented by 20 basis points of cash margin expansion. Third, attributable AFFO per share as adjusted grew approximately 10% year-over-year as strong adjusted EBITDA growth was enhanced by disciplined management of below-the-line costs.\nFinally, we are raising our full year outlook across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO and AFFO per share. The outlook raise is supported primarily by FX tailwinds, U.S. services outperformance and net interest benefits as compared to prior outlook. Our expectations for organic growth and CoreSite revenue growth remain in line with our prior outlook.\nNow let's dive into our results. Turning to third quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 5. Consolidated property revenue grew nearly 6% year-over-year. U.S. and Canada property revenue was flat year-over-year and grew approximately 5% when excluding noncash straight line revenue and Sprint churn. International property revenue grew approximately 12% year-over-year and nearly 8% when excluding noncash straight-line revenue and FX impacts. Finally, data center property revenue grew over 14%, driven by a record quarter of retail new leasing and consistent pricing growth.\nMoving to the right side of the slide. We delivered consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5%, in line with expectations driven by solid demand across our global portfolio. Our U.S. and Canada segment grew approximately 4% organically and greater than 5% when excluding Sprint churn. As a reminder, this was our final quarter of Sprint churn. Organic growth in our international segment was nearly 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in Africa and APAC, steady mid-single-digit growth in Europe in low single-digit growth in Latin America as expected.\nTurning to Slide 6. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 8% year-over-year as strong revenue growth was enhanced by disciplined cost management. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO per share as adjusted grew approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by robust EBITDA growth and prudent management of below-the-line costs.\nNow let's turn to our revised full year outlook. As I mentioned, we are raising guidance across all of our key consolidated financial metrics. Starting with property revenue outlook on Slide 7, we are raising our outlook by $40 million at the midpoint, which implies approximately 3% year-over-year growth or approximately 5% when excluding noncash straight-line revenue and FX impacts. We are reiterating organic growth assumptions across all regions and continue to expect organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% and data center growth of approximately 13% year-over-year.\nThe increase in outlook was driven by $50 million of FX tailwinds, a $5 million increase to pass-through revenue and $5 million of incremental non-run rate revenue in the U.S. This was partially offset by $20 million of revenue reserves in Latin America, primarily related to our previously disclosed legal dispute with AT&T Mexico over the calculation of tower rent.\nAs we disclosed in September, we reached a positive interim agreement with AT&T Mexico whereby AT&T Mexico has paid American Tower the majority of withheld payments and will resume monthly payments of the majority of tower rents owed going forward. The remainder of the rents not paid to American Tower are to be deposited into an irrevocable escrow account administered by an independent trustee. The funds in escrow will be released in accordance with the final ruling of the arbitration or by mutual consent of the company and AT&T Mexico. We remain confident in the terms of our master lease agreement with AT&T Mexico and expect to prevail in the arbitration.\nPer our conservative reserve policies, our 2025 outlook assumes approximately $30 million of revenue reserves for the full year, of which $19 million are already reflected in our results through the third quarter. We expect future reserves of approximately $8 million to $10 million per quarter until the arbitration is settled. The arbitration is scheduled for hearing in August of 2026 and the final ruling may come at a later date.\nMoving to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $45 million at the midpoint, which implies approximately 4% growth year-over-year or approximately 7% growth year-over-year excluding noncash net straight-line and FX impacts. The increase to outlook was driven by $30 million of FX tailwinds and $15 million of upside from consolidated operating profit primarily driven by U.S. services outperformance.\nAnd finally, moving to our outlook for AFFO on Slide 9. We are raising our attributable AFFO outlook by $50 million, which now implies growth at the midpoint of approximately 7% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis or approximately 9% excluding financing costs and FX impacts. The increase to outlook was driven by $20 million of FX tailwinds, $15 million of cash adjusted EBITDA and $15 million of upside from other items, consisting of $15 million of upside from net interest expense and $5 million of upside from cash taxes and minority interest, partly offset by $5 million of higher capital improvement CapEx.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our 2025 capital plan remains consistent with our prior outlook. We continue to expect to distribute approximately $3.2 billion to our shareholders as a common dividend in 2025, subject to Board approval, and expect $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. $1.5 billion of our capital expenditures are related to discretionary projects of building approximately 2,150 new towers at the midpoint and $600 million of data center spend. Importantly, we expect 80% of our discretionary projects this year to be in developed markets, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy that Steve reiterated earlier.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, our balance sheet remains strong. With our net leverage now at 4.9x, $10.7 billion in liquidity and low floating rate debt exposure, we have significant financial flexibility. We'll remain disciplined in how we utilize our balance sheet and allocate capital to optimize long-term shareholder value creation.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we have executed $28 million of share repurchases, and we will continue to be opportunistic in utilizing the remaining $2 billion that the Board has authorized for share repurchases.\nTurning to Slide 11, and in summary, we are pleased with our results year-to-date, which demonstrate the fundamental durability of our business model. Robust mobile data consumption growth and demand for our interconnection-rich data centers underpin a long runway of growth opportunities for American Tower. With our best-in-class portfolio of towers and data centers and strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to capture these growth opportunities and deliver on our goal of industry-leading AFFO per share growth.\nAnd with that, operator, we can open the line for questions.",

Welcome to the American Tower Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear a message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, simply press star one one again. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Kate Reeb, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKate Reeb\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations, American Tower\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower Q2 Earnings Conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nI am joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO, and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2025 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nSuch factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. As you can see from our results, 2025 continues to be a good year. Demand for our tower leasing, services, and data center businesses, combined with FX tailwinds, has led us to raise outlook for property revenue, EBITDA, and AFFO. These results highlight the ongoing strength of our global businesses and the durability of mobile network demand that underpins it.\nAnd American Tower continues to offer a predictably compelling value proposition for investors against a volatile macroeconomic backdrop. I'll briefly share a few highlights and trends before Rod discusses more detailed results and outlook. Mobile data consumption continues to climb, driving increased demand for network capacity in every region where we operate. We see this demand catalyze activity across our extensive tower footprint and drive network upgrades as the sunsetting of legacy radios faster than we've seen in early 5G cycles. Carriers in developed markets continue to expand and mature their 5G networks as they work toward aggressive coverage and quality targets between now and the end of the decade, while emerging market players actively complete their 4G rollouts and selectively yet increasingly pursue the 5G cycle.\nIn our developed tower markets, which consist of the US, Canada, and Europe, mobile traffic growth rates are anticipated to slightly outpace global averages over the next five years. And increasingly data-intensive and uplink use cases like mobile video, AI, and new devices will continue to stress networks and prompt both mid-band coverage and capacity-driven 5G activity across our tower footprint and rooftop sites. In the US, we see the 5G cycle playing out in line with our original expectations as carriers continue site upgrade activity to work toward 2026 5G coverage goals and begin early densification-oriented colocation activity to improve network quality. We still see significant differences in mid-band rollout progress across our portfolio, positioning us well to capture substantial new business for both amendments and colocations, with the latter comprising an increasingly material share of application mix for certain Big Three customers.\nOn a combined basis, total application volumes increased more than 50% year over year, representing strong broad-based demand for our sites. Our US services business posted a near-record quarter, propelled mainly by outsized construction services, signaling our customers' increasing recognition of the quality, efficiency, and overall value that we provide through our best-in-class offerings. Next, our Europe business also continues to trend in line with expectations, benefiting from a healthy overall operating environment and strong customer agreements that provide both growth and insulation from various customer shifts across the region. Mid-Band coverage now stands at just about 55% of the markets where we operate, which is slightly ahead of the continental average and leaves a significant runway for more coverage-oriented activity as carriers pursue 2030 rollout targets.\nAdditionally, spectrum extensions and related coverage obligations in Germany should unlock long-term investment and yield future growth benefits, and in the near term, are bringing energy and momentum to 5G rollout activity. In our emerging markets, we've raised our outlook due to a mix of FX tailwinds and core leasing outperformance. Our Africa business continues to post robust growth results, benefiting from a stabilized lower churn carrier landscape, better consumer pricing in key markets, and supportive demand dynamics. 5G maturity remains limited in the region, with most activity focused on 4G rollouts and densification, but we do see early 5G deployments continue to progress in select urban areas, propelled by use cases like fixed wireless. Activity has improved in markets like Nigeria, where higher consumer prices are supporting better carrier economics and unlocking stronger levels of network investment.\nGrowth in Latin America remains muted relative to historical trends, and our expectations for persisting low single-digit growth through 2027 remain unchanged. However, consolidation has normalized in Brazil, and new activity is anticipated across the more stabilized three-player market as carriers work to fulfill regulator commitments in the region and realize better margins from higher RPs. Our outlook for the region has modestly increased, but along with some improvements in markets like Brazil, we're seeing continued elevated levels of churn as carriers rationalize the infrastructure they require through consolidation activity. Moving to our data center business, we continue to see exceptional performance from CoreSite and have increased our 2025 expectations to reflect new growth attributable to the recently acquired DE1 facility, as well as elevated demand and pricing from our broader portfolio of interconnection data center facilities.\nHybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture requiring secure, low-latency interoperability remains a primary driver of demand, but early phases of AI-related workloads, including inferencing, machine learning models, and GPUs as a service, represent a fast-growing component of CoreSite's leasing. Capacity constraints from high absorption rates and continued AI-driven demand from both very large hyperscale players across the wider market and the enterprise customers that value our interconnection ecosystem are driving a sustained, favorable pricing and pre-leasing environment that we expect to continue into the foreseeable future. These tailwinds have enabled us to remain selective in our customer mix to curate high-quality ecosystems while exceeding our initial underwriting assumptions. We plan to continue to prioritize funding CoreSite on a success basis and in line with our capital allocation strategy to replenish supply and facilitate future growth.\nOverall, our outlook is generally looking up as we enter H2 2025, but we remain focused on delivering our differentiated value proposition and staying true to our stated strategy. Our experienced team is well-versed in addressing certain ebbs and flows across our global footprint, and our strategic long-term focus enables us to benefit from the durability of tower leasing and growing mobile data and computing demand trends. Our superior global portfolio, best-in-class services and customer delivery, high-quality balance sheet, protective contracts, and highly disciplined approach to capital allocation already enable us to extract significant value from the global tower landscape, but we remain motivated to continuously improve and deliver even more compelling returns to our stakeholders. Now I'll hand it over to Rod to discuss Q2 results and our revised 2025 outlook. Rod?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nThanks, Steve, and thank you all for joining the call.\nAs noted in this morning's press release, we had a strong second quarter driven by resilient demand across our global portfolio. We are well-positioned to benefit from growing mobile data consumption and confident in our ability to sustain growth through the second half of the year. Before diving into our Q2 results and our revised full-year outlook, I'll share a few highlights. First, leasing momentum remains strong, resulting in consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.7%. Our US services business had a near-record quarter, while application volumes among the Big Three were up over 50% year over year. This was primarily driven by amendment upgrades and a 200% year-over-year increase in colocations.\nCoreSite also had an exceptional quarter with double-digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion, fueled by hybrid cloud demand and AI-related use cases. Strategically, we closed the acquisition of our DE1 data center asset in Denver and deployed over 75% of our discretionary capital in developed markets, rising to over 85% when including acquisition capital. Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet by issuing EUR 500 million in senior unsecured notes at 3.625%. Proceeds were used primarily to pay down existing debt. At quarter end, floating rate debt was approximately 7% of our total outstanding debt, and net leverage stood at 5.1 times. Turning to Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide six, consolidated property revenue grew 1.2% year-over-year and more than 3% when excluding non-cash straight-line revenue, despite absorbing more than 70 basis points of FX headwinds.\nYear-over-year growth was negatively impacted by 2% due to a change in non-recurring revenue in the current period relative to the prior year. US and Canada property revenue declined by more than 0.5% and grew approximately 3% when excluding non-cash Straight-Line Revenue, despite absorbing more than 100 basis points of Sprint churn. International property revenue grew approximately 1% year-over-year and approximately 3% when excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Finally, property revenue in our data center business grew over 13%. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated Organic Tenant Billings Growth was 4.7%, driven by solid demand across our global portfolio. In our US and Canada segment, Organic Tenant Billings Growth met our expectations at 3.7% and greater than 5% when excluding Sprint-related churn.\nOur international segment drove 6.5% in Organic Tenant Billings Growth, a modest step down from Q1 2025, reflecting generally consistent leasing trends paired with slightly lower contributions from escalators, and churn. Turning to slide seven, adjusted EBITDA grew 1.8% and approximately 4.5% when excluding non-cash net straight-line, despite absorbing approximately 90 basis points of FX headwinds. Growth was positively impacted by continued direct expense management, resulting in a high conversion of cash property revenue and a greater than 100% increase in US services business gross profit, partially offset by the flow-through of non-recurring revenue benefits in the prior year period, increased bad debt associated with Latin America customer collections, and other non-recurring and timing-related costs. Cash adjusted EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points year-over-year, partially driven by a higher contribution from US services.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share declined by approximately 6.7% and 6.8% respectively, primarily due to more than $65 million of prior year revenue reserve reversals in our India business. On an as-adjusted basis, normalizing for the sale of India, attributable AFFO per share growth was approximately 2.4%, driven by the high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to AFFO through the effective management of below-the-line costs, partially offset by flow-through of non-recurring revenue benefits in the prior year period previously mentioned. Now, turning to our revised full-year outlook. As you will see on the next few slides, our core year-to-date results and expectations for the second half of the year are contributing to improvements across property revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to our prior outlook. In addition, our revised FX assumptions are providing tailwinds of $130 million, $80 million, and $55 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and attributable AFFO respectively.\nAs a result, we are raising our expectations for property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share by approximately $165 million, $120 million, $55 million, and $0.12 respectively compared to our prior outlook. At the midpoint, our expectation for attributable AFFO per share is $10.56 or approximately 6% year-over-year growth on an as-adjusted basis. Turning to slide eight, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $165 million compared to our prior outlook, which includes $130 million of FX tailwinds, $15 million of consolidated core property outperformance, and $20 million of additional upside, consisting of an approximately $25 million increase in Straight-Line Revenue, partially offset by an approximately $5 million decrease in Pass-Through Revenue. Consolidated core property outperformance includes upside from international and CoreSite, including incremental contributions from our recently acquired DE1 asset.\nOutperformance was partially offset by slower commencements compared to initial expectations related to a customer in the US, which affect organic tenant billings growth expectations that I will touch on in a moment. Moving to slide nine, we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth expectations of approximately 5% on a consolidated basis. We have revised our expectations for the US and Canada organic tenant billings growth to approximately 4.3%, reflecting slight timing differences due to modestly slower than initially anticipated pacing of new business. Importantly, while the timing of commencements could result in some quarter-to-quarter variability, it does not change our overall expectations to capture the new business.\nIn addition, we are reiterating our Organic Tenant Billings Growth expectations of approximately 5% for Europe, raising our expectations for Africa and APAC to greater than 12% due to solid carrier activity and slightly lower churn expectations, and raising our expectations for LatAm to greater than 2% driven by modestly higher-than-expected contributions from CPI-linked escalators. Turning to slide 10, we are increasing our Adjusted EBITDA outlook by $120 million compared to our prior outlook, driven by the conversion of property revenue, services gross profit, and FX tailwinds, partially offset by non-recurring expense items, including incremental bad debt associated with certain Latin America customers. Moving to slide 11, we are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $55 million at the midpoint, or $0.12 on a per-share basis. Cash Adjusted EBITDA outperformance and FX tailwinds are partially offset by increased minority interest and maintenance capital.\nOur revised attributable AFFO per share midpoint is $10.56. Year-over-year, AFFO per share growth is now expected to be approximately 6% on an as-adjusted basis. Turning to slide 12, we are modestly revising our 2025 capital plans, which include approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, down $20 million compared to prior outlook, and contemplates a 100-site reduction in Latin America and consistent data center spending. We continue to expect to distribute approximately $3.2 billion to our shareholders as a common dividend, which remains unchanged from our prior expectation and subject to board approval. Moving to the right side of the slide, our balance sheet is strong, providing financial flexibility and optionality, including $10.5 billion in liquidity and low floating rate debt exposure.\nTurning to slide 13 and in summary, we're pleased with our results through H1 2025, which highlight the criticality of our assets, the resilience of our business model, and the outstanding execution of our talented employees. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. And with that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you so much. And as a reminder, to get in the queue, simply press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To remove yourself, press star one one again. Please stand by for our first question. And it's from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks and good morning. So first, I'm curious if you could dig further into the different observations for domestic leasing.You talked about the increase in applications from amendments and colo/densification, but also the delay in commencements from one of your customers. So can you talk about a little bit more about how that's affecting the second half of the year? And is that setting up 2026 to be a better year and to get some of these benefits to come through?\nAnd then secondly, I was just curious if you could provide an update on the opportunities to extract an incremental layer of efficiency within the business. Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah, thanks, Mike. I'll take both of those. So when you look at the US leasing environment, what we're excited to see is the increase in application volume that we expected from the beginning of the year. And so that's playing out in line with our expectations. So if you look across the board, we're seeing a healthy level of activity.\nAnd we're seeing continued increases in the pipeline, and we're seeing an increase in the new colocations on that. So that's all very positive. We're excited to see that, and that's indicative of a very healthy leasing environment. And in terms of kind of what we're expecting in our pipeline, the volume that we were expecting from our customers is consistent, and the pricing is consistent. What has been a little bit slower than we expected is the conversion from one of our customers of that leasing into commencements. And that's a customer that's not on the holistic agreement.\nAnd so when we did our forecasting, we had a certain cadence that we thought that we were going to see in there, and they're just moving a little bit slower than we expected. So from our perspective, you're talking a few million dollars of in-year. That's all in the difference, and that OTBG metric is very sensitive to the timing of commencements on it. But when you look at the health of the business and the fact that we're going to get that new business, we're very confident in that. We're not seeing anything that would indicate a pullback. We're not seeing the pipeline of applications dry up.\nWe're not seeing them cancel projects or anything like that. It's just a little bit slower cadence in terms of signing the leases, getting them back, and getting the equipment installed. So from our perspective, there's nothing on that that indicates anything other than a robust leasing pipeline. We'll leave 2026 guidance to 2026. If you think about kind of the variables going into 2026, a good pipeline is important, and that's what we're seeing is a pipeline that's kind of supportive of our long-term guide that's there. We do have less contracted revenue going into the next couple of years than we had the prior years, so we are more dependent on that activity-based revenue commencement. And so we are excited to see that pipeline continue to build.\nThat's positive for us. We are still expecting churn to trend down. Now, that's not considering the UScellular transaction, which has now been approved. So that's something we'll be watching. That's a variable looking into the next couple of years to see how that's going to affect it. But overall, I'd say the pipeline's healthy, and we'll wait to give guidance on 26 when we get there.\nAs for your second question, in terms of the extracting value, I've given Bud close to the end of the year to give me guidance on that. But the efforts are progressing very well, and we've had some very good receptivity across the globe to our globalization efforts, and the team is seeing opportunities there. And just to kind of set expectations in terms of what that's going to look like, we're looking at our total addressable spend. So that's including direct expenses, O&M, SG&A, growth capex, supply chain, and all those different areas in it. And the overall goal that we've set ourselves is to have a continuously increasing gross margin in our tower business. So you probably shouldn't expect to see a huge decrease in direct expenses.\nSome of that is just the cost of doing business, but the goal is to bend the curve down so that those are growing slower than our revenue in every geography on a consistent basis. And so as Bud works through what this looks like, it'll be kind of a multi-year goal that we set out to bend that cost curve down to give us better margin expansion than what we would see otherwise on that. So we'll continue to work through that. And again, I'm committed to you guys. By the end of the year, we'll get some targets out there. But so far, everything is kind of aligning up with what we thought we were going to see when we started this journey, and we feel very good about that in terms of what we're going to be able to create in terms of value creation over time.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Michael, this is Rod. Maybe I can add just a couple of quick points here for you to follow up on Steve's comments. Regarding new business, all the things that Steve mentioned around timing in the US, you'll see that play out in our numbers, primarily in new business and organic tenant billings growth. So we were at a projection of about $165, 165 million or slightly better for new business. With this revised timing of the pacing of some of the deployments, that number is expected now to be more like $160. And it is a timing-related issue, as Steve mentioned.\nAnd what that does is it affects OTBG in a very modest or subtle way. Our original guide was equal to or greater than 4.3% in the US. We've adjusted that to approximately 4.3% just to reflect the fact that we could be at 4.3% or slightly below because of this mild timing. So just to give you a little bit of numbers there. And then I would just make one quick comment on SG&A for the full year of 2025. We expect to be roughly flat on SG&A, excluding the bad debt.\nAnd that's after absorbing things like a few legal fees for some of the customer issues that we have in in Latin America, as well as managing through the very robust business in CoreSite. There is some added SG&A there to support that double-digit growth. So you'll see us absorbing that and also keeping SG&A flat with a few other kind of timing issues in there.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nMorning, Rick.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Rick.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nHey. A couple of questions. Follow-up, Steve, you mentioned UScellular T-Mobile deal now is approved. Can you frame for us what that USM exposure you think might be and the timing for that? And then obviously, more speculative, just maybe an update on DISH, what you're seeing there and what the exposure is there.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. So with respect to UScellular, in absolute terms, not the overlap, but the total amount of new business we have with UScellular, it represents about less less than 0.5% contribution to our property revenues, our global property revenues, and less than 1% to our US and Canada property revenues. So it's relatively small exposure overall. And if you look at that that portfolio, what we don't know yet is what T-Mobile plans to do with those sites. And so as we're looking at over the next couple of years, a lot of it depends on what their plans are. We haven't been able to have discussions on that because the deal wasn't approved yet.\nSo that's kind of a worst-case scenario. We certainly wouldn't expect to lose all of that, but there will be some of that that they're going to want to churn off of as part of their synergies, and we'll work with them on that similar to the way we have in the past. And so as that closes and we have those conversations, we can give you guys a little bit more visibility into it over time. And and by the way, those percentages of total revenue, not new biz; that's total revenue. That's less than 0.5% of property revenues and 0.5% of US and Canada revenues on that.\nWith respect to DISH, we continue to watch the situation like everybody else does and to see what's happening there. We think there have been a few positive developments in terms of some of the things that they've said publicly that they're doing. So we feel pretty good about that. The overall exposure to DISH is they represent about 2% of our global, over 2% of our global revenues, slightly over 4% of our US revenues. And that's, again, total exposure for that portfolio. But again, what we're seeing is the same thing you guys are seeing.\nThe headlines are slightly positive lately. So we're optimistic and hopeful that they'll work through their situations and continue to deploy.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Rick, if I could add something.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nAnd obviously, go ahead, Rod. Yeah.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nSorry, just regarding the churn, since you brought up churn, I've been looking forward to saying this for a few years here, but just to remind everyone that we are in our final year of the Sprint churn. So when you think about the churn percentages for Q3, we were at a little over 2%, maybe 2.3% total churn in our US business. As we work through the churn this quarter for Sprint, it won't be in our Q4 numbers or any numbers beyond that. And we expect churn as a percent to drop down to about 100 basis points or maybe even below for Q4.\nAnd then probably stay in that lower end of our range between 1% and 2% as a churn number, kind of staying at the lower end of that, closer to 1% for a little while, excluding the things Steve just talked about in terms of UScellular.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nA lot of discussion lately about direct-to-device satellite connectivity. You guys own a piece of ASTS. Update us a little bit about what you're seeing in direct-to-device and what you think it might mean US versus international.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nWe continue to see direct-to-device as the complementary technology to the macro cell networks. Delivering bandwidth via macro towers continues to be the cheapest way to deliver bandwidth to the customers no matter where they are. So we don't view it as a threat at all to our business in the US or internationally, quite frankly. The places where satellite is going to be ideal are places that have lower population densities than what the carriers would like to cover through macro towers. So when you think about the Grand Canyon or rural Montana, those are places where that's going to be an excellent way to provide coverage.\nAnd we don't have towers there. And frankly, I don't want to build towers there because there's not a good business case for doing that. Same thing internationally. If you look at Sub-Saharan Africa, there are going to be places that are much better served by satellite. Again, we don't have towers in those areas and don't want to build towers in those areas. So overall, we believe it's complementary, not competitive.\nSo if you think about where those satellite coverage is optimal, it's less than 100 pops per site per some of the research that's kind of been cited out there. So we view it as a nice niche market. We're happy with our investment in AST. We're really happy with the ringside seat that we have to see how this plays out. And it's all playing out just the way we thought. No threat, and complementary, and might make a nice little profit on our investment there.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question, please. And he's from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nHey, morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah first, just to dig in a bit more into your prior comments, Steve, regarding the customer that's moving a bit slower than you had expected.\nJust to be clear, is this just a lengthening of the Book-to-Bill cycle? So they're kind of applying and signing leases as expected, but it's just dragging it in terms of when they get on air? Or are you seeing the applications come in with a bit of a delay?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nNo, it's exactly what you said. It's the Book-to-Bill cycle is a little bit longer. The application pipeline continues to be healthy. It's just not not moving along as quickly as we anticipated it to do.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Okay. So it's in your backlog. It's just purely timing then.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nExactly.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Great. And then maybe switching to CoreSite, could you talk a little bit about CoreSite's position in the supply chain and kind of the risk management strategy you have in place? In particular, I'm thinking with the jump in demand for a lot of key components to support big projects from both established and new players. I'm curious as to whether it's becoming at all more challenging for CoreSite to kind of keep its place in line.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nWell, a lot of the supply chain challenges really started during COVID. So that whole supply chain process lengthened several years ago. We had to adjust our strategy then. So we started pre-buying those long lead time items several years ago. And the way you secure your place in line is you got to pay. So you put a deposit down on that equipment.\nAnd so we've been very proactive in looking at that over time and and securing those places. The other component that we're watching very closely, like everyone else is, is the effect of potential tariffs on some of those supplies because a lot of those components can only be sourced overseas. And what we're doing to protect ourselves there is building a contractual mitigation so that if there are an increase in costs when we're doing the pre-leasing, that we have a mechanism to adjust that to make sure that we're getting that mid-teens stabilized yield that we're underwriting on things. So I feel very good about the actions the team has taken to be able to secure that. And for all of our kind of development pipeline that we have in view and the things that we've planned out, we're secure on that.\nIt it may make it challenging to accelerate things from the pace that we originally wanted. We'd like to accelerate some of this development because the demand environment is so healthy right now. And it does make that a little bit more challenging, but we are finding ways to do that in some circumstances as well. So certainly a challenge out there that we're all facing, but something that I feel like the team has done a good job of getting ahead of.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Great. And sorry, can I ask one quick housekeeping item on the CoreSite front as well? Anything you can share about the inorganic contribution from the Denver Gas and Electric Building acquisition, both financials and what it may have meant for interconnection adds, which looks like they may have had an inorganic bump?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nLet me talk about the acquisition kind of more broadly, and then I don't know if we have any financials that Rod can share at hand right now. But that building was one where we already had a presence. It was a leased facility for us, but we didn't have the whole building. And so we had the opportunity to buy the whole building. And if you have a chance to take that interconnection hub and make it owned versus leased and pick up some incremental new business and incremental interconnection along the way, that's always a good thing to do. So we're very happy that we had the opportunity to do that.\nAnd it is the most highly interconnected site in that Denver area. So it gives us another kind of feather in our cap in terms of that portfolio. And Rod, I'm not sure if we put any public numbers out on the acquisitions or something. You want to share on that or not?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nCan I get a? Yeah, just a couple of points that I would make for you, Nick. So we did close on the DE3. We have it in our outlook. I think I made a couple of comments in the script there, but you can assume that there's roughly $10 million in property revenue in our updated outlook coming from DE1.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the data center business and then wanted to ask about LatAm. On the data center side of things, DE1, $10 million of property revenue this year. Is that a good run rate to use for next year or could we expect a bigger kind of run rate contribution for the full year of 2026?\nAnd maybe just kind of talk about directionally whether you expect the overall CoreSite business to to sort of grow the same, better, or or decel next year relative to this year on an organic basis.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Jim. So the $10 million is the in-year, the in-year number that reflects the fact that we completed the acquisition earlier this year in Q2. So with that said, there would be a full year impact next year. So you'd want to pro-rate that. But I don't want to get into any more details around what the exact impact would be for next year.\nRegarding CoreSite, you can pick up in Steve's comments, his prepared comments, as well as mine. The CoreSite business continues to perform very strongly with revenue growth up in the 13%, better than 13% for the quarter. We expect a very similar number of revenue growth for the full year. That double-digit growth also extends down into interconnection growth, which is a key element of that business. So we expect interconnection to grow, interconnection revenue to grow by double digits. We also are seeing margin expansion in the in the business.\nAs I mentioned earlier on this call, we have a little bit higher SG&A in CoreSite to support the demand that we're seeing, and all the new business that we've booked. So you'll see a slight bump up in SG&A, but our operating profit margin is also expanding year-over-year this year by about 100 basis points. So the business continues to perform exceptionally well. Based on the last several years of either near record new business or record new business as we had in 2023 and then again in 2024, we expect that double-digit growth to continue for the next couple of years based on kind of exhausting that backlog and delivering all those new business contracts. So we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of CoreSite, not just the last several years, but going forward as well.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. And then as a follow-up, maybe if you can kind of talk about the LatAm business. Sounds like things are stabilizing, or potentially improving there. Are we at a point where you can call a bottom in LatAm? And to what extent could you expect some significant acceleration hitting in 2026? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. We're still anticipating to have low single-digit growth for the next couple of years there. So through 2027, we're going to continue to deal with the dynamics of that market where you have higher churn. We've had to take a little bit of a reserve on some collections issues there as well. And as that market continues, you know, to go through the challenges of consolidation and what's happening there, it's going to be a challenge for the next couple of years.\nAnd it's all the things we've talked about, things like Oi in Brazil, some of the consolidation, and some of the other markets there. So you should expect to see that continue to be a challenge for the next two years. And we think that the inflection points are really going to happen in 2028. That's when we see things getting significantly better for us there.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Funk\n\nSVP, Bank of America\n\nYes.Hi, good morning. Thank you for the questions. So just coming back to the conversion from leasing to commencement from the one customer, just wonder if anything in your experience in the past could inform our view on the timing and what might move that forward?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nIt really just comes down to their priorities and what they're trying to accomplish and how they're incentivizing their teams. So there's nothing specific that I would point to in this circumstance. When you look at kind of the relative positioning of the the three major carriers, we have one that's got about 85% of our sites are upgraded to mid-band 5G, one's at about 70%, and one's still at about 50%. And that implies quite a bit of work to do to get to that kind of upper 90s percentage, which is where we think we'll end up with mid-band 5G on the sites. And so when we were doing our forecast at the beginning of the year, the way we construct that is we're going based on what the pipeline looks like, what we're hearing the priorities are from the people in the field.\nAnd then you're only talking about a relatively small slowdown in that conversion rate. So there's not like a like a major catalyst that we're seeing on it. And I don't want to speculate as to the reason because no one's given us a reason for it. I think it could just be the pace at which they're doing the deployments. So there's nothing in this from kind of a prior GE or prior deployment that I would look at and say there's a there's a comparison of this. It's just a little bit of a slow start to the year, quite frankly.\n\nMichael Funk\n\nSVP, Bank of America\n\nOkay. So nothing to point to either on the on the labor side, equipment provision, or if it's simply a capital budget decision, nothing to really point to there?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThere's nothing pervasive. I mean, I'm sure every site has its own story, but there's no kind of general trend there.\n\nMichael Funk\n\nSVP, Bank of America\n\nOkay. I think in the prior remarks, you mentioned, made some comments about Europe, particularly Alex actually on change. I thought you mentioned Germany. Can you dig in a bit more on what you're seeing in Europe and expectations for that region?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. I'll touch on that, Rod, if you want to jump in. We continue to see the European carriers steadily deploying mid-band 5G on their sites. And there's kind of a mixed bag in terms of how far along they are in that. But there are some targets in the EU to get to a certain percentage of Mid-Band 5G deployment by 2030. So there's still quite a bit of work left to do there. So what we're seeing on that front is we're seeing our anchor tenants continue to do amendments to get there, and we're seeing some continued deployments by other carriers.\nThere is some consolidation that's happening in a few markets. And our exposure, that's relatively modest. It's not zero, but it's relatively modest in terms of what that consolidation churn could be. And that will slow down some of those carriers and their deployments a little bit. But overall, the leasing pipeline there is consistent with what we had in our underwriting for the deal originally. It's consistent with our kind of mid-single-digit organic growth in Europe that we're expecting to see.\nSo overall, it's kind of right in line with what we thought. And none of the consolidations or kind of other news in the market is concerning us at this point.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. Nick, maybe I could just—\n\nMichael Funk\n\nSVP, Bank of America\n\nGreat.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nThank you for the question. Nick, if I could just add a—or I'm sorry, Michael, I would just add a couple of comments around the stability of the revenue growth expectations and particularly the organic growth. So it's a solid kind of steady mid-single-digit organic new biz. Let's call it in around 3.5% contribution to organic tenant billings growth comes from that new biz. That's pretty consistent with where it was last year. I think across most of the markets there, we have CPI-linked escalators that add a little bit more to that, another 2.5% or so.\nOne of the other very important elements is that the churn percentage is historically pretty low. And the way that our contracts work, particularly with one of our largest customers, we expect that churn percentage to be below 100 basis points kind of going forward. It's been there for a couple of years since the acquisition. So you put all those things together and you get a very reliable and and durable organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single digits, again, in a very high-quality market, high-quality economies there with high-quality counterparties. So again, the acquisition that we did in Europe and our and our general Europe business is very steady, very solid, and of a high quality.\n\nMichael Funk\n\nSVP, Bank of America\n\nVery helpful color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. I appreciate the question. Rod, I think you talked about a 200% increase in colocations year over year. So I'm just curious what the mix is in your guide for this year, how that might trend after 2025. Then I wanted to touch on capital allocation as well with leverage kind of around 5x now. How are you thinking about buybacks versus M&A going forward? Maybe just a quick review of what multiples and what regions you might be interested in. Thanks.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYep. Sounds good, Eric. So regarding the the colocation increase in terms of its contribution, I would start off by saying colocation contributions continue to be relatively small in the grand scheme of things. So let's call it just over 10% of our applications that have been coming in are colocation applications. Now, that's up from where it was, you know, in the recent past here.\nSo we are seeing a shift of of towards colocations, but it's on small numbers. To put it in the grand scheme of things, it's it's if you think about applications being up in the 18,000 range or even a little bit higher, you know, you're talking a few thousand, a couple thousand colocations, 2.5 to 3,000 colocations kind of in total. So we are seeing hundreds of additional colocations, but it's not thousands yet. So I would put it in the category of we're seeing the beginning of a shift towards colocations, the beginning of an increase towards colocation as a bigger contributor to our new business. This may be the beginning of densification, but it's still early days. And with that said, I wouldn't want to predict where that's going to go in 2026 or beyond.\nWe'll just have to wait and see what the carrier plans are, when they get to full 5G kind of across the board, and when they may actually turn to more densifications.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nBefore we go to the next question, I would just jump in and say, just refer back to the percentage that I gave earlier of about 50%, about 75%, about 85% going there already at mid-band 5G. That still implies a good-sized pipeline of amendments. So we would expect amendments to be a large portion of our pipeline going forward. But we do expect this continued trend of more colocations to continue to accelerate. We do think densification is starting. And I talked about this on our last call.\nThe conversations we're having with carriers and the data requests that they're putting in are definitely supportive of the idea that we will continue to see densification as they as they continue to flip their networks and become stressed.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower",
    "content2": "Yep. Then, Eric, regarding your question around capital allocation, so you are correct in pointing out that we're above 5.1 times leverage for the end of Q2. We still are marching towards 5.0 or below by the time we get into the second half of the year. So we're on pace with that. And the plan there is unfolding perfectly fine. One of the elements of a of being at 5.1 now is with the strengthening euro up against the US dollar. That did drive an increase in our European, the amount of US value in our European debt, which does impact leverage slightly. So we're at about 5.1 times.\nWe want to push that down to its 5 or below. And once we are there, and I would say we're close enough to be there that we've already regained some some financial flexibility, let's call it full financial flexibility. So with that said, let me highlight what our capital allocation priorities are. First and foremost, we fund the dividend. That dividend in the last couple of quarters has represented a 5% growth rate. We've talked in the past that we would expect, because we're a REIT, that our dividend growth will largely be in line, on average, over multiple years with our AFFO growth.\nSo you can think of that, the context there. We do expect to fund the dividend with a growth that's sort of in line with our AFFO growth on average. That's priority number one. Number two is we have a CapEx program with internally generated projects that we prioritize because we like the returns, the contribution to the business, the long-term value that that capital can drive for our shareholders. So we invest this year about $1.7 billion. It's been between $1.5 and 2 billion over the last few years. We expect that to continue as we have a robust pipeline of places to put that capital. And again, we think it's a compelling use of capital to drive shareholder value.\nAnd then beyond that, we have options to either reduce debt and delever well below five times, or we could deploy that capital towards more inorganic growth through M&A. And I think you know our priorities there around looking to expand and increase exposure to our developed markets, which are US, Europe, and CoreSite as well. And then beyond that, it's it's share buybacks are an option. So we will always be toggling between and evaluating reducing debt, M&A, and share buybacks with an eye towards making the decisions really on a quarterly basis, an annual basis that drives the most shareholder value that represents the best opportunity at that time. And you may see us kind of bounce back and forth here and there. We've, you know, we've talked many times about the capital programs, but I also want to highlight the fact that within our capital programs, that $1.7 billion, that actually represents some of our priorities where we've decreased the amount of capital investments in some of our emerging markets at the same time that we've increased capital investments in the US, in our data center business, and even in in Europe.\nSo you see our priorities showing up within our capital spending. But what I would say in the final comment here is everything's on the table for us, and we will be making decisions in the best interest of our shareholders over the long term. That certainly could include share buybacks, delevering, or when and if we see compelling M&A, we'll certainly look at that.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks,.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nGood morning.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nSteve, wondering if I know you get this question a lot, so I figured I'd ask it given just the performance of CoreSite continues to be impressive and accelerate. Just the strategic lens that you guys look at this business within American Tower, particularly as you talk about kind of value maximization.\nDoes the fact the business is performing better make you more or less interested in exploring strategic options, or just any change in your philosophy as you watch the business perform well would be helpful to hear as you guys think about maximizing value on this business?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Well, just to remind everyone, the reason that we bought CoreSite was because we believe that when you look at where to skate to where the puck is going, to use the Boston analogy on that, we think that edge compute is a huge opportunity to drive value to our tower portfolio over time. And we believe that owning the access to the interconnection environment that that edge has to be connected to gives us a right to win in that space. And our initial timing of that was a little bit off.\nIt's developing slower than we thought it was going to. But we are confident, and probably more confident today than we were even back then, that the edge is going to develop the way we envision that doing. And and one of the ways that we're seeing that is the wireless carriers are now talking about edge and doing local breakout. That's actually appearing at the edge. And you're starting to see them express more interest in the space. So we still think that that strategic reason for buying CoreSite holds true.\nWhen you look at the asset itself, the way we underwrote that investment is we underwrote it as a standalone. So meaning we weren't putting the value of the edge into the value of the asset when we bought it. We were just looking for underlying business instead. Can we make that work on a business case?\nAnd we were confident that we could. So in a way, the edge was kind of going to be the gravy on top of the investment, but it was the strategic reason for doing it. The asset's performing better than our underwriting. And some of that is derived from AI and what's happening in the whole ecosystem where it's taking up a lot of the capacity there. That's driven up pricing, which has helped us to underwrite better yields and continue to curate our customer mix the way we like to, but actually lease it faster. So it is performing exceptionally well as a standalone asset. That doesn't really change my assessment of of what we're going to do with the asset over time.\nIt really comes down to what's going to create the most value for our shareholders. We still think the edge is a compelling play that will develop over time. And if for some reason that doesn't, then we'll make the assessment about what to do with CoreSite. Our focus in the meantime is to maximize the value of CoreSite. And so we continue to invest what we need to invest and and to maximize that value. We set up a private capital partnership to give us flexibility in terms of how we finance it.\nSo there's never a situation where CoreSite feels like it can't do what it needs to do to maximize that growth. And so we think that we're doing the all the right things to create the most value for the shareholders, regardless of what the ultimate decision with CoreSite is, you know, down the line.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And just maybe one more. It was interesting last week.\nAT&T, I thought, sounded more excited about fixed wireless than I'd heard them in the past. Their their growth in that business is accelerating, and talked about opening up more mid-band for that product. Are you seeing, I know, again, you don't see that directly in the business, but any sense in the application activity or anything else with AT&T or your your other carriers on fixed wireless starting to be a more clear tailwind towards capacity needs for your customer base?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah, at this point, all of our customers say that they're using available capacity in the network to support fixed wireless. And there's nothing that we're seeing that differs from what we're hearing from the customers publicly on that. I think where you would see that over time is if you start seeing rural sites that typically didn't get multiple amendments in the 4G cycle, get multiple amendments in the 5G cycle, that might be an indication. We're not seeing that yet. And we're not seeing any standalone fixed wireless installations at this point. However, as you point out, all the customers are becoming more bullish on it. I'm very bullish on it.\nI come from a rural area where you don't have good broadband, so I'm actually excited to see it expand in my home state. And I think that if you look at the number of subs they've got, the ARPUs they're getting, to me, that's indicative that they could make this a separate business that could support incremental investment. And if and when that happens, that's incremental to our base case in terms of what we would see in terms of the activity on our site. So that could be an upside for us. We're not seeing it yet, but I do hope that we do see that over time.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\n\nAri Klein\n\nDirector of Equity Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThanks and good morning. Maybe just on the services business, which has been quite strong. Curious if you could talk to what's been underpinning that because they're having higher periods of activity with lower services levels. Is there anything new there or different that you're doing, and where do we kind of go from here? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nNo, the services business. It's indicative of two things. The first is a robust application pipeline. And so there's a segment of our services that we do for all of our customers kind of nationwide. And that's things like acquisition, zoning, and permitting; engineering services; things like that. And that component is really volume-driven. So when you see the application volumes go up, that gives a good tailwind to the services business there.\nThere's another piece of it that's a little bit bigger chunk of the pie this year, which is construction management, which we don't do everywhere. We don't do it for everyone. It's very much a niche business that we do where we have really capable teams in place and where our customers are asking for that turnkey service because it it lowers their total cost of ownership. It increases the value proposition there. And so that's a little bit bigger piece of the pie. But what you should read in terms of our services business this year is it gives us the indications of a healthy pipeline and that we're getting some good business in the construction management.\nNow, that construction business comes in a little bit lower margin. So you will, over time, if that continues to grow, see some compression in the margin on the services business. But it's all still a very healthy business, and it's good for us because it is some incremental cash flow, but it also increases customer satisfaction and stickiness.\n\nAri Klein\n\nDirector of Equity Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back for final remarks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please feel free to reach out to the investor relations team with any questions. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And this concludes our conference for today.Thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect."

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Tower Q2, 2025 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 11 on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations in FP&A. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, American Tower\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Q1 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we referred to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nI'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO, and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2025 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, and any other statements that regard matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nSuch factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. As you saw in this morning's report, we're off to a strong start to the year, exceeding our initial expectations across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and attributable AFFO per share for the quarter, with demand persisting across our global portfolio against a challenging economic backdrop.\nI'll briefly share a few updates and trends from the quarter before Rod discusses more detailed financial results and our full-year revised expectations. I'll start with leasing trends and carrier activity. The durability and quality of our cash flows, combined with ongoing resilience and network investments to meet growth in the mobile data demand, continues to offer our investors a compelling option in American Tower. The large US carriers have publicly stated aggressive goals to substantially complete 5G equipment upgrades across nearly all of their networks by the end of 2026 and are driving broad-based amendment activity complemented by the early signs of capacity-oriented new site demand. In fact, Q1 represented our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential increases in both application volumes and services revenue, which grew roughly 60% and over 140% year-over-year, respectively.\nMeanwhile, in Europe, we continue to see steady demand across our ground-based and rooftop sites, highlighting a marked support elevating the roughly 45% current mid-band population coverage and meeting 2030 coverage targets. We're seeing similar resilience across our emerging markets. In Nigeria, improved consumer pricing dynamics are facilitating enhanced cash flows for the carriers and, in turn, accelerating new business. In Brazil, the benefits of a stronger three-player backdrop are beginning to emerge, with carriers steadily upgrading their networks to similarly realize the spectral efficiency benefits we've highlighted in the US, meet regulatory coverage requirements, and begin to fill in their networks. While we're encouraged by the demand across our emerging markets footprint, we're going to closely monitor the global economic backdrop and any potential implications of that, including on FX, where certain emerging markets could be more susceptible, along with various customer events and collections in select markets.\nOur CoreSite business posted yet another set of impressive results in the quarter, fueled by strong leasing and continued pricing favorability, while bringing the first phase of our NY3 center and the second phase of our CH2 center online, collectively adding 11MW of capacity with a high degree of day-one leasing. The team's consistent approach to underwriting, with a focus on curating high-quality, interconnection-rich ecosystems across a diverse set of cloud, network, and enterprise customers in leading markets, yields best-in-class returns while insulating against broader market shifts. Overall, CoreSite performance, supported by accelerated demand and a right to win through market positioning and service quality, continues to exceed our initial expectations and merit the elevated levels of capital that we've allocated in our 2025 plan. Next, I'll touch on capital allocation and portfolio management.\nWe continue to actively assess and manage our portfolio following our grow, harvest, and resolve methodology to reduce risk and drive higher quality, more predictable earnings. We've previously highlighted discretionary capital prioritization to our developed markets, where we have a right to win. Consistent with this approach, we purchased our DE1 data center in Denver, an existing facility where CoreSite had maintained a partial lease. Direct ownership of this building, which serves as the primary point of interconnection in the Rocky Mountain region, would enable CoreSite to control the area's only four cloud on-ramps and one of the top network and peering ecosystems. Furthermore, on the resolve into the equation, we successfully closed our previously announced sale of our South African fiber business in early March, marking a key step in the continued reduction of our international fiber footprint.\nThese activities reflect productive steps in our continual aim to hone our global portfolio mix by emphasizing core markets and products that drive synergistic value and durable cash flows that we expect to translate into attractive returns for our shareholders over the long term. Finally, I'll touch on our global operations and our value proposition. We have a great core business anchored in high-quality, high-margin assets that we maximize with strong terms and conditions, strategic counterparties, and world-class operational execution. We already have a track record of building on this strong foundation by leveraging our scale, core competencies, and financial flexibility in a way that drives both customer and shareholder value. This includes US.\nInnovations like our instant colocation engine, our fleet of drones and digital twin technology, our suite of site and construction services, our backup power solutions, and our programmatic approach to land buyouts, not to mention our holistic contract structures. Internationally, our best-in-class African power program, which we've optimized through a creative sustainable energy investment and the use of comprehensive data analytics, predictive monitoring, leveraging AI, our enhanced European book-to-bill processing, and many other developments provide meaningful advantages. As we globalize more intentionally, there's significant opportunity to evaluate cross-border applicability of these regional offerings to drive efficiency and unlock incremental value. Now, we're still in the early days of mapping our globalization plan, but we've already had an active start to the year as our team works to evaluate opportunities to streamline our operations and enhance synergies across our markets and products.\nWe're excited to build on the momentum we've established and further leverage our scale, core competencies, and balance sheet to enhance our market-leading position. I look forward to sharing more specifics in time. In closing, growth in mobile data has proven resilient across various economic cycles over my two-plus decades with American Tower. As I mentioned at the onset, I'm encouraged by the durability and leasing demand for our global portfolio of assets. I simultaneously exercise a degree of caution in anticipation of persisting forward-looking volatility and uncertainty. I firmly believe that American Tower's approach to enhancing our organization and customer value proposition through the means that are within our control, including our globalization initiatives, portfolio mix, and quality of earnings and balance sheet, provides an additional degree of strength and differentiation moving forward.\nSimilar times of volatility and uncertainty during my tenure have historically presented incremental opportunity for us, and I'm optimistic that the steps we're taking today will have us well-positioned to capitalize on any environment. Now, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our Q1 financial performance.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nThanks, Steve, and thank you all for joining the call. As Steve mentioned, we are off to a strong start to 2025, with our customers continuing to invest in their networks as global mobile data consumption continues to grow. Before I discuss the specifics of our Q1 results and revised full-year outlook, I'll summarize a few highlights. First, the solid leasing trends we observed over the course of 2024 continued into Q1 of 2025, resulting in consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.7%. As a result of accelerating power activity, our US.\nServices business delivered its highest quarter of revenue and gross profit since 2021, with applications rising nearly 30% compared to levels seen in Q4 of 2024 and up roughly 60% versus Q1 of 2024, reflecting a mix of continued amendment-driven upgrades and new colocations. In addition, CoreSite delivered high single-digit revenue growth underpinned by a continuation of robust demand for our interconnection hubs. Consistent with past quarter themes, we complemented durable top-line performance with prudent cost management, providing year-over-year cash-adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of nearly 70 basis points to 68.2%.\nNext, we continued to execute on our stated priorities, successfully closing the sale of our South Africa fiber business in early March, completing the purchase of our DE1 data center asset in Denver in early April, deploying over 75% of discretionary capital expenditures in the quarter towards our developed market platforms, and resuming dividend per share growth of approximately 5% year-over-year for the quarter. Finally, we further mitigated 2025 refinancing risk by successfully accessing the debt capital markets last month, issuing $1 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of just over 5%. Proceeds from the transaction were used primarily to pay down existing debt. At the end of the quarter, floating rate debt represented approximately 4% of our total outstanding debt, while net leverage reduced to 5 times, in line with our stated target, resulting in enhanced balance sheet strength and improved financial flexibility.\nTurning to Q1 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide six, consolidated property revenue growth was slightly positive year-over-year and up approximately 3%, excluding non-cash straight-line revenue, while absorbing approximately 300 basis points of FX headwinds. US and Canada property revenue declined approximately 1% and grew over 3.5%, excluding non-cash straight-line, including over 1% negative impact from Sprint churn. International property revenue was roughly flat year-over-year, with growth of approximately 8%, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Finally, property revenue in our data center business grew by approximately 9%. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 4.7%, supported by solid demand across our global portfolio. In our US and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was in line with expectations at 3.6% and approximately 5%, excluding Sprint-related churn.\nAs highlighted on our last earnings call, we continue to expect growth to be below 4% for the next two quarters due to Sprint churn before increasing to over 5.5% in Q4. Our international segment drove 6.7% in organic tenant billings growth, a modest acceleration from Q4 of 2024, with generally consistent leasing trends, escalator contributions, and churn. Turning to slide seven, Adjusted EBITDA grew 1.9% and up over 5.5%, excluding non-cash straight-line impacts, while absorbing approximately 300 basis points of FX headwinds. Growth was supported by a high conversion of cash property revenue through ongoing cost control and an over 140% increase in our US services gross margin associated with an increase in tower activity.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share declined by approximately 1% and over 1%, respectively, primarily due to contributions from the India business in the prior year period, which had benefited from nearly $30 million in revenue reserve reversals. On an as-adjusted basis, normalizing the prior year period for the sale of India, growth was approximately 6.6%, driven by the high conversion of cash-adjusted EBITDA growth to AFFO through the effective management of below-the-line costs. Now, turning to our revised full-year outlook on slide eight, we are pleased with the results to date in the durable demand trends that underscore our performance. However, like prior years, and given proximity to our previously released outlook, we have kept core full-year expectations largely unchanged with updates to our FX assumptions.\nConsistent with past practice, our projected FX rates for outlook take the more conservative of bank forecasts and the trailing 30-day spot rate averages for each currency, which has generally resulted in rates more conservative than current spots. As a result, we are raising our expectations for property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share by approximately $50 million, $30 million, $20 million, and $0.04, respectively, compared to prior outlook solely attributable to updated FX assumptions. At the midpoint, our expectation for attributable AFFO per share is $10.44, or nearly 5% growth year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. Furthermore, we are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across all regions, including greater than or equal to 4.3% in the US.\nand Canada, or greater than or equal to 5.3%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn, and approximately 12%, 5%, and 2% to the Africa and APAC segment, Europe, and Latin America, respectively, collectively driving approximately 6% for international and approximately 5% on a consolidated basis. Complementing our organic trends and supporting margin expansion, our revised outlook maintains the expectation for a year-over-year reduction in cash SG&A. Turning to slide nine, we are generally maintaining consistent capital allocation expectations for the year, updated only to reflect small M&A transaction closed during or shortly after the quarter. We continue to expect an approximately $3.2 billion common dividend distribution to our shareholders, subject to board approval, and approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, which includes 2,250 newly constructed sites at the midpoint and roughly $610 million for data center development.\nI'd like to reiterate that while overall capital spend is moderately increasing year-over-year as we execute on attractive development opportunities across the US, Europe, and CoreSite, we continue to reduce investments across our emerging markets. In 2025, investments in Latin America, Africa, and APAC will primarily consist of augmenting sites to accommodate incremental tenants and executing on previously committed multi-year built-to-suit agreements with leading carriers. Moving to the right side of the slide, our balance sheet remains strong, providing financial flexibility and optionality, including $11.7 billion in liquidity and low floating rate debt exposure. Turning to slide 10, and in summary, we're off to a great start to 2025. The resilience of our global business demonstrates strength amidst a challenging economic backdrop.\nDespite ongoing market uncertainty, carriers continue to invest in the networks to accommodate growing demand for mobile data consumption, which underscores the critical nature of our global portfolio of assets. This, combined with our highly focused and disciplined approach to capital investing, our best-in-class operating platforms, and our strong balance sheet position us well to reliably deliver high-quality earnings and compelling total shareholder returns over the long term. And with that, operator, we can now open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, guys.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I could. First, maybe more high-level. You've done a lot of portfolio optimization in recent years. And so I'm wondering if it's fair to assume, on a go-forward basis, a more sharpened focus on the globalization strategy, more cost optimization with the remaining assets that you've got in place. And then secondarily, on the US side, it sounds like there's still a lot of momentum both in services and new applications. I'm just wondering how we should think about the cadence of colo and amendment revs in upcoming periods relative to the $38 million in Q1. And I guess more specifically, whether you're still comfortable with that $165 to $170 million range that was laid out for new leasing last quarter. Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah, Nik, thanks for the question. I'll take the first question. I think it's fair to say we're going to be focused on both. When you look at our portfolio optimization, that's an ongoing analysis that we will continue to do with the management team and the board. And so that's something that we look at on a continuing basis. We review it. And I think what we've said pretty clearly is we don't have anything that we're specifically looking to divest necessarily, but there are markets that are in our resolve category that we've highlighted, and also businesses that are non-core to our business. And with those businesses, the way we look at that is we look at the value of the ongoing cash flows. And then if we think that someone's willing to pay more than the value of those ongoing cash flows, then we would look to do a transaction.\nIf not, we'll harvest the cash flows from those and continue to operate them. We have kind of reordered our operations so that there's nothing that there's a compelling reason to divest. We've kind of started operating some of those markets out of regional hubs and looking at it that way. We'll continue to do that evaluation. You may see us continue to optimize, and you may see us not do that if it's not going to add more value for the long term. Our globalization efforts, though, are a huge focus for us right now. We've been very successful in bringing down SG&A over the past couple of years. We kind of took the low-hanging fruit first on that. We still think there's some room there as well. We're going to keep working on that.\nWhat we've got Bud focused on in his new role as Chief Operating Officer is really looking at the rest of the business across the globe to see what type of synergies can we get across the globe with the rest of our cost structure. We're in the thick of that right now. We've got people, teams looking at that. We're looking through the different categories of spend, and we're trying to figure out what the opportunities are there. That's something that we'll share with you guys later in the year as we come up with some better targets on that. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing. We think there's definitely some opportunities there to take some of these best practices that I highlighted in my opening remarks across the globe. We're excited to focus on that as well.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Matt. Good morning. I'll take the second part there. I think you asked really two questions. The first one hit the services number and how that kind of rolls into the new business number. As you heard in my prepared remarks, we started this year with a really strong services result, achieving about $75 million of services revenue for Q1. We're seeing a pickup in activity versus our original outlook that we talked about last February when we announced the Q4 earnings. Things are starting off very strong for us. We also expect that to continue into Q2. That's steady, kind of strong demand for the services business. Another quarter in that range of about $75 million is what we're targeting. Still in the range for the full year for a strong revenue full-year number in and around the $240 to $250 million range.\nThat would imply a lower amount of revenue for Q3 and Q4. So we do see that in our outlook. Now, much of that is driven just on the reduced visibility when you get into the outer part of 2025. So can we outperform that? Certainly possible. We have less visibility when you get to the end of the year. So we are seeing a very strong start to services, and we expect maybe that drips down a little bit just because we don't have as much clarity when you get to the end of the year. When you jump into the new biz numbers, the $165 number for the US is absolutely what we are targeting. You saw for Q1, we hit a number around $38 million. That was down a little bit from Q4, which was about $45.\nThis cadence here is really the opposite of what we see in the services. Another month or another quarter for Q2 in that $38 million range wouldn't be out of the expectation for us. And then in acceleration, they're getting up over $40 for the last two quarters, over $40 million for the last two quarters. And that would put you right in that target range of the $165, $165 plus.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. First of all, when you look at the sort of US. Carrier activity and the activity you're seeing there, with respect to leasing activity, it seems relatively consistent with what you had projected, but on the margin, can we maybe talk about any kind of changes that you're seeing as we head through the end of the year in terms of what is being prioritized by the carriers in terms of new activity? And then secondly, following up on the cost efficiency program, Steve, you're pretty clear about that being a focus for you. Maybe just give us a sense of, without giving us a firm target, directionally as you head into the out years, is the target to kind of get from the 7% constant currency AFFO growth you're doing this year to something closer to double-digit in the out years? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSo I'll start with the carrier activity in the US. So what we're seeing is exactly in line with what we've expected to see. We talked about it last year and talked about it this year, which is kind of a steady ramp, which we think is consistent for this phase of the 5G build. And if you look at the public statements by the carriers, they've all set some pretty aggressive targets to getting to close to full deployment of their mid-band spectrum across the portfolio. So there's still a decent amount of amendment activity that we expect to see over the next two years as they take those percentages covered by mid-band from somewhere in the 50% range for one of the carriers. The other two are a little bit higher, up to that 80% to 90% coverage over time. And so there's still a good degree of activity there as well.\nWe are still seeing some new colocations as well, though. And that comes in two flavors. We are seeing people that are increasing coverage, some of those consistent with governmental requirements they have, some of them just trying to paint the map a little bit more. And we are starting to see some new colocations coming in for densification. So it's really consistent with what we've been talking about for the past couple of years, which is the capex activity is broad-based. They are going to continue to deploy their 5G until that becomes ubiquitous. And we are starting to see the early signs of densification, which is what we thought we would see at this place in the cycle here. When it comes to the globalization, nice try. I'm still not going to give you guidance for multi-year, but I'll give you credit for trying there.\nThe way we're looking at it is we're looking at the category of expenses that's really in our controllable spend. So you've got our operations and maintenance, the SG&A we're already looking at. We're looking at our supply chain to see if we can actually impact our growth CapEx or our maintenance CapEx by doing a little bit better there. And we'll continue to assess that. There's no specific target for that. And so I'm not going to commit to what we're going to get to on AFFO in those out years. Certainly, the focus for the entire management team here, though, is to do everything we can in the business to grow our AFFO per share. And we're focused on that long-term value creation. So everything that we do, including our cost savings, is geared toward the long term.\nWe're not looking to make a splash in a quarter and then have expenses rebound. We're not looking to damage the business that would hurt our growth. We're looking to be very thoughtful about all the changes we make to actually increase our customer service, to increase our automation, to actually increase revenues by being a better partner to our customers. And as we have those targets, I'll share those later in the year.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Jim, and maybe I'll just highlight a couple of numbers here. So for the 2025 outlook, maybe just reminding you and the group here that we are planning for SG&A reductions at about $13 million, mid-teens here, excluding the impacts of non-recurring bad debt that we saw in 2024. And that's on top of a 2024 over 2023 result where we reduced SG&A without the impacts of bad debt by even more than that.\nSo we've been managing costs pretty tightly throughout the SG&A for a few years now, consistently bringing those numbers down in the face of pretty significant inflation in the US over the last several years.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nI hadn't tried. Thank you.\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Rick Prentiss from Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.\n\nRick Prentiss\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates\n\nHey, it's morning, everybody.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nMorning, Rick.\n\nRick Prentiss\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates\n\nHey. A couple of questions. Appreciate that. First, I always have thought capital allocation is probably the top job for senior management. You guys have been working on that as you laid out. Leverage now hit 5.0. We're getting closer to that coming below 5.0. Update us as far as thoughts on stock buyback. Is there an authorized program? M&A, clearly another potential. Any portfolios out there? Maybe explicitly talk about Canada as a market, not necessarily the transactions that might be out there, but what would be the attributes that would be attractive in a country like Canada?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure, Rick. So stock buybacks are absolutely on the table as one of the potential uses for the capital that we generate. We do have an authorization by the board. It's a $2 billion authorization. It's outstanding. So that is out there. At this point, the way we look at our capital allocation, to your point, we've just got to that 5.0, so we should be delivering further from there. And the way we really look at it is what's going to create the most long-term value. So we'll weigh those stock buybacks against any M&A opportunities, our internal CapEx program, further delivering, etc.\nIn terms of the M&A market today, we did close a small transaction in the US this year already. We'll continue to be opportunistic where you find the right portfolio at the right price. We don't see any large-scale opportunities that are taking us off of our path. We've been pretty clear about that for the past few quarters. That hasn't changed. We're still not seeing any huge opportunities out there that we think are compelling enough. Canada is an interesting market for us. We have a small portfolio there. It's performing very well. We like that market in terms of what we're seeing today. We have a lot of ability to operate that market out of the US. There's a lot of synergies that we would have if we did do something in Canada. I know there's some rumors of transactions out there.\nAnd what I would say is true of Canada is very similar to what we had in Europe, which is we're going to be very disciplined in looking at terms and conditions, number one, and valuations, number two, in terms of trying to figure out if a transaction makes sense. And so if a portfolio trades and the terms and conditions are something that's not going to give us a long-term value creation opportunity, that's probably not the right deal for us. Similarly, if the price is too high, we're not going to stretch for something unless we think it's going to create a lot of long-term value for our shareholders. So we like the market. We can operate it from the US with a very huge amount of synergies with anything we did there.\nIt would make sense if we had the right deal, but we're going to be patient and get the right terms and conditions and valuation on it. Makes sense.\n\nRick Prentiss\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates\n\nI think have you changed your middle name officially to Steve Terms and Conditions, Vondran?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nI think I did a long time ago, Rick.\n\nRick Prentiss\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates\n\nOne follow-up for me also, some questions around colocation amendments. Can you break out for us what we saw in Q1 as far as colocation amendment, kind of the split between those? Because we are watching that some folks are starting to see some higher amount of new colocation, obviously comes in at a much higher incremental revenue than amendment.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. So we're seeing a continued increase in the colocation applications. And so with that, we're seeing an increase in both amendments and new leases.\nWhile the percentage of contribution from the colocations has increased a little bit, the base has gotten bigger too. So it's not a huge proportion shift for us. Again, if you look at where those carriers are, you've got one that's about 80% deployed, one's in the 65 to 70, one that's still around 50. So there's still a lot of amendment business to be done on our portfolio. So while I do see an increase in colocations, it's not making a huge shift in our mix today. You expect over the next couple of years we see more of that? Oh, you definitely will. We're seeing this phase of densification start. And even before you get the applications, you start having conversations with the carriers. They start asking for more information on the towers, what rent centers are available, what's the structural capacity look like, etc.\nSo as we continue to hear those information requests, that gives us a lot of confidence that we're going to see an increase in colocations over time as they move into that densification phase over the next few years.\n\nRick Prentiss\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks and Good morning. Just first, when you look at the colocation opportunity that you were just describing, I'm curious how much of that is competitive, whether it's other large tower firms, smaller private firms, or build-to-suits, whether it's by the carrier or some of the other private firms. How much of that is competitive? And is there an opportunity to work with your customers to try to improve your share or win rate, if that's an option?\nAnd then second, just looking at the annualized EBITDA, and it looks to be above the high end of the guidance range, so the annualized first quarter number. Just curious if there are certain items that we should be mindful of through the year that may pull EBITDA back into the current guidance range.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. I'll take the first question. I'll let Rod answer the second. So when you look at the new colocations the carriers are deploying, it really depends on where they're deploying, on what the competitive options are. If you look at all the towers in the US, there's very little overlap between existing towers in most of the markets. And that just makes sense. You don't want to deploy redundant capital if you don't need to. Colocations are the most cost-effective way for everyone to deploy.\nSo you don't see a ton of overlap between the towers that are out there. When you're getting into pushing into kind of paint-the-map spaces where people are trying to increase rural coverage, a lot of those areas don't have coverage because there aren't towers there. So you do see more new builds in that area. So overall, it kind of depends on the geography that they're in. In terms of whether you can influence your share, you can. And it comes at the RF design phase. It's when they're actually designing their networks. And if you are a preferred partner and you provide great customer service, they know you can get them on air quickly, they'll target your sites.\nAnd that's what we see with our customers and what we've been able to do over time is to get a good share of their business by being a really good partner to our customers, providing great customer service. Now, when you're looking at infill sites and some of the densification, there may be a little bit less flexibility because you're looking at filling in sites within an existing design. So the geography probably plays a bigger role in where that split cell has to be, or in terms of if they're trying to fill a hole in the network where that is. And so they make fewer choices there. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag depending on what their goal is, where they're building, and what the existing infrastructure is.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Michael, I'll take the second question you had there relative to the EBITDA and the cadence throughout the year. What I would say is we're very pleased with our Q1 results. We had a strong result on EBITDA and AFFO, AFFO per share. When it comes to EBITDA going out for the full year in our outlook, at this point, we believe that it's prudent to just hold our outlook kind of where it is. So we did outperform our EBITDA outlook for Q1. Some of that was driven by the strong services outcome. Again, and I mentioned this a few minutes ago, there is the potential for services revenue and therefore margin and EBITDA contribution to drift down in Q3 and Q4. So that could reduce kind of the run rate of EBITDA.\nBut at this point, given the proximity of our original outlook and, quite frankly, the general kind of market backdrop, and maybe this is more appropriate to AFFO and AFFO per share, where you see the same kind of a cadence, right? If you look at our Q1 AFFO and AFFO per share result and you annualize that for the full year, it suggests we're going to outperform our full-year outlook. When you get into the AFFO numbers, some of the drivers there can be different quarter to quarter, notably cash taxes. There's a significant timing issue there for differences quarter over quarter, as well as maintenance capex. So those things kind of can move that number around on a quarterly basis. So when you look at EBITDA and AFFO, yes, we had a very strong, very good quarter in Q1.\nIf you would annualize that, you'd get an additional outperformance for our full-year numbers. At this point, because of timing issues, because of a potential decline in services at the end of the year, we think it's prudent to just hold those outlooks consistent with the original outlook, with the exception of updating the FX numbers.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHey. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, can you expand a bit on the sort of services work that you're seeing behind the big increases and the degree to which that revenue is coincident with the leasing activity that you're seeing versus being more of a leading indicator? And second, I know you need to be a bit careful with the specifics of any deal and any particular customer.\nBut if EchoStar would engage in some sort of transaction involving its spectrum, whether a sale, or a lease, do you have any contractual protections above and beyond their promise to pay the agreed-upon rent? Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSo I'll start with the EchoStar question first on that. We don't want to get into terms and conditions with the agreement, but we do expect to get paid. And so all we've built into our kind of ongoing guidance for our kind of future growth is the minimum contractual commitments under that agreement. So that's what's baked into our multi-year guide, and that's what we're expecting out of those guys. We're not anticipating anything that materially changes their business. And if it does, we'll kind of figure that out when it happens. But we do expect to get paid there. Sorry, remind me of the first question.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nOh, sorry. Yeah. The mix there and the degree which it's coincident versus a leading indicator.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. So our services business, I kind of break it into two categories. The first is really site acquisition services. That's things like zoning and permitting, engineering services, things like that. That's a pretty steady part of the business. We do have a slightly larger proportion of construction services this year. We don't do construction services nationwide, and we don't do it for all the carriers. It's much more of a targeted activity that we do in a couple of regions because we've got really good teams there. That construction services is project management. We don't have the crews climbing the towers. We're managing that process. So we have seen a slightly larger component of that this year. But the overall services business is up.\nIn terms of how that translates into revenue, there's a little bit of a disconnection from the activity levels and services to our property revenue because of our Comprehensive Agreements. In those agreements, there's a steady cadence of what we're going to get paid on there. It's a little bit independent of the activity levels. However, we do have one customer that's not on a Comprehensive Agreement. We also have new colocations that are outside of some of the other Comprehensive Agreements. Those are much more affected by activity timing. When you think about the cadence of services versus the property revenue, if they're not part of a Comprehensive Agreement, there is a little bit of a lag time from when you see the services revenue to when you see those commitments. That varies a lot by customer.\nSo I would think about that as being somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 180 days, depending on the customer, the type of transaction, and the geography on that.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Nick, I'll just add one additional point when it comes to services. The margin that we see in that business this year, notwithstanding the increase in revenue and the way Steve talked about the shift towards a little bit more construction management, we are consistently seeing north of 50% margins. Our outlook assumes a 52% margin on this business, which is very consistent with what we saw in 2024.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. My question on LATAM, I think you mentioned that you are seeing a bit more activity showing up.\nWe haven't really seen that in the results yet. So can you talk to the cadence of incremental leasing in LATAM? And I think churn came in a bit lower. Was that just timing? And how should we think about the escalator? I think that was better as well.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. So we are seeing pockets of increased activity, in particular in Brazil, as some of the carriers who may be pushing about starting to enhance their 5G offerings. So we continue to see some new business from that. There are also markets that are further behind in that cycle because it's taken time to get the spectrum out there. So if you look at Mexico, Mexico is a little bit behind in terms of starting a 5G deployment there. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. And we do still have multiple years of churn in Latin America.\nSo we are guiding for OTBG in Latin America to be low single digits for the next three years. And part of that is the Oi churn. We'll continue to see wireless churn from Oi over the next two years. And in 2027, we'll have wireline churn from Oi. And we do have some churn that we've already recognized in those markets. So we're past most of the Telefónica churn in Mexico at this point. And we have had some churn in Colombia and Chile that we've worked through with WOM. And we'll continue to monitor that and see how that progresses. But that's all consistent with our multi-year guide of low single digits there. And so we are seeing, again, a little bit more investment as the Brazil carriers get through their digestion of the purchase of Oi as they start working on their networks.\nWe think that'll continue. And we think we'll continue to see growth in leasing across that market. But we're still going to face the headwinds of churn for the next three years there. In terms of the escalator, we're anticipating about 5% in 2025, but that is CPI dependent.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you're obviously off a holistic agreement or comprehensive agreement with one of your large carriers. And I know they have a lot of work to do with mid-band coverage. So maybe you could provide some color on any discussions with them on potentially moving into a new holistic agreement. Are you happy with the à la carte arrangement? And how do you think about kind of the cadence of their spending contributing to your leasing throughout this year into next?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. Thanks. When we think about our comprehensive agreements, those are really a vehicle to make the operational relationship between the customer and us a lot simpler and a lot easier. And we're very comfortable operating either on an à la carte basis or in a comprehensive MLA. And you can pretty much be assured we're always talking with all of our customers about a deal. The ink doesn't even dry on the signature before you're having the next discussion with the customers on that. But in terms of whether we're going to get into a new agreement or not, we're pretty agnostic about that. We're open to it. And so we'll just continue to provide the best customer service we can.\nWe'll continue to dialogue with the customers. And if the interests align in doing something, we will. And if they don't, we'll continue on the à la carte basis. For us, it's really about whatever drives the best long-term value. And if you look at our leasing growth that we had today, it's a function of what we signed in our T's and C's 20 years ago. And we'll continue to be disciplined about that. We'll continue to do what is the best thing for our customers and our shareholders in terms of negotiating those agreements over time. So you shouldn't read anything negative or positive into the fact that we don't have a comprehensive MLA. It's just not the right structure for the parties at the time.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you. And just one follow-up question. I wanted to touch on the CoreSite footprint. There obviously have been a ton of headlines in the data center segment year to date around certain hyperscalers slowing, some questions around enterprise IT spending, just given a lack of visibility in the broader economy. So maybe you could just touch on what your sales funnel looks like within the data center business across the cloud companies and the more type of retail colocation companies as well?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. We have a robust sales funnel at CoreSite. And just to remind everyone, it's really an interconnection business. It's different than what you would see in the hyperscale world or in a colo facility that's really there for people to save money. People come to CoreSite because they need to be in an environment where they can interconnect to multiple players, have access to multiple cloud on-ramps. And we're not seeing any flagging of demand for that today.\nIn fact, what we see is more and more enterprises want to take advantage of the multi-cloud environments so that they can take advantage of some of the new tools, some of it being AI, some of it being traditional cloud tools that are there. And what we're seeing in that space is more demand. We're seeing our existing customers looking for more space. We're seeing new customers looking for larger installations there. And we just don't see that tailing off anytime soon. We think that core business of ours continues to be robust. We also see good demand in the retail space. So we've been able to have a few good quarters in retail that give us a lot of confidence about that business going forward. But it's really that core enterprise demand that's in the interconnection ecosystem that drives the bulk of our leasing in CoreSite.\nAnd we think that that's a durable demand for the foreseeable future, despite the pullbacks you see in hyperscale, despite even any economic uncertainty that's out there. People are going to continue to invest in automation because that's how they're going to get the cost savings they need in the rest of their business. So we feel very confident about that demand pipeline. All right.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks to you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Mike Funk from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Funk\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Good morning. Thank you for the questions. So you mentioned uncertainty a few times, prepared remarks. And you held back from increasing guidance ex-FX impact. So I guess maybe some more color if you could on the markets that are more vulnerable that are leading you to maybe hold back on increasing guidance and what you're looking for in those markets?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nI'll start. Maybe Rod will want to jump in there. When we think about the US, we don't think any of the uncertainty that's out there is going to affect demand in the US this year. Even some of the uncertainties driven by things like tariffs, that's probably more of a future-looking risk than a 2025 risk. Most of the equipment that people are going to deploy is already here in warehouses this year. So we're not as worried about the US. When we look at internationally, there's probably some opportunity and some risk in those markets given some of the macro uncertainties that are out there.\nWhen there's global macroeconomic shocks, it tends to affect the emerging markets more than it does the developed markets. So that's what we're watching now, is to see if there's any impacts there that we're not anticipating. There's nothing in our view said today that we're specifically worried about. It's much more of the general economic condition that's out there. Probably the biggest impact that we're seeing right now in the uncertainty is FX. But I'll let Rod jump in.\n\nRod Smith",
    "content2": "EVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. A couple of things that I would highlight when I think of uncertainty, and you heard me say it in my prepared remarks: it's really the general macroeconomic backdrop. The uncertainty around potential increases in inflation in the US or decreases, it could go either way. I think that the uncertainty there still exists.\nThat certainly puts uncertainty in the mix when you think about interest rates going forward. I think we've all appreciated over the last several months some of the political discussion around tariffs and other things can have impacts on businesses around the globe. It also can have impacts on foreign exchange rates, which we are sensitive to in certain regions. So maybe I'll highlight that piece first. I think everyone can appreciate our methodology of applying FX rates to our outlook. I described that in the prepared remarks. If you just take the spot rates today, we would see a benefit of up to $120 million in our revenue line in our outlook for the balance of this year. That would also translate into a $70 million positive impact to the EBITDA numbers that we have. That's better than $0.10 on an AFFO per share.\nThat's better than the outlook we just rolled out this morning for everyone. So it's too early for us to count on those spot rates. Things can change. That's an example of uncertainty. And then also with interest rates. Interest rates can move around, and that certainly can impact our AFFO and AFFO per share. Now, with that said, you've seen us take multiple steps to strengthen our balance sheet to reduce the refinancing risk this year. That includes paying down much of the bonds that are coming due this year, as well as dramatically reducing our exposure to floating rate. We've gotten that down into the low single digits as a percent of our total debt being exposed to floating rate. That's less than $1.5 billion of floating rate debt in aggregate in total.\nThe other thing I would highlight here is we only have a handful of bonds left to renew. It's a little over $2 billion when you think about the balance of this year. And within that, it's about $2.5 billion or so. Within that, we've already refinanced or issued new bonds at the beginning of Q2 here of $1 billion. So we've already taken half of that remaining refinancing risk off the table. That puts us in a pretty good place relative to refinancing risk, right? Maybe $1.5 billion of refinancing going out, up against the very low percentage of our debt that is exposed to floating rate debt. That means we could refinance all of the remaining bonds throughout 2025 without getting into the capital markets at all if we chose to.\nWe could pay those off with the revolvers we have and still be in the single digits in terms of ending the year with floating rate as a percent of our overall debt. That gives us tremendous optionality to manage through this uncertainty. So those are just a couple of examples of what uncertainty means to us. Yeah.\n\nMike Funk\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd I said thank you for the color. One more, if I could quickly. Can you help us frame how much of the service revenue growth was due to one carrier upgrading or doing their RAN upgrade versus more traditional service revenue? And maybe how far they are through that process.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nIt's pretty broad based on that. So with the construction services, that is much more regional for one carrier.\nBut you can't read anything into that because it's a pretty steady cadence with that carrier, regardless of what they're doing in the area there. But I would just say the rest of the services business is pretty broad-based. Okay. So more organic, not necessarily one carrier RAN upgrade dependent. Yeah. It's just more general activity levels on the tower. So it's a little bit of everything. It's the new colocations. It's the amendments. It's just all the activity on our sites. We capture a pretty high degree of that activity in our services business. Great.\n\nMike Funk\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Excuse me. Two questions. We had another quarter last week of strong fixed wireless growth across your domestic carrier customer base.I know it's hard to sort of map that to what you're seeing in your business, but just wanted to see if, Steve, if you had any updated thoughts on sort of the increased activity you keep talking about and seeing in your business, the outlook for accelerating growth, and the role fixed wireless may or may not be playing in carrier investment into their networks. Then maybe for Rod, I think you guys last quarter talked about having maybe a quantified cost savings initiative, a message for us later this year. I know you don't have anything new on that front today, but just wondering if you have any update in terms of the process or things that the team is focused on or opportunities that you think are sizable just as we kind of think about that opportunity longer term for the company. Thank you, guys.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nI'll take the second one first on the cost savings. It's really a matter of where we are in the process. We've got teams looking at the various cost components around the globe. So the way I would think about that is you've got SG&A that we have looked at. We've already made some progress on SG&A over the portfolio. We've kind of harvested a lot of the low-hanging fruit there. There's still probably a little bit of room there, but we're still trying to figure out exactly what that means. When you look at the rest of the cost stack, it's things like operations and maintenance, some of our development CapEx, and things like that. We might be able to save some money with supply chain. We're still in the early days of assessing that, so we really don't have targets for you guys.\nBut we do think there's opportunity directionally on that. In terms of the fixed wireless, anything that our carriers can monetize is good news, right? They're able to put more customers on their network. We're seeing them earn some healthy returns on the fixed wireless that they're doing. But what they're saying publicly is still that they're using fallow capacity on the network. And there's nothing that I would say that would contradict the carriers on that. I think that that's what they continue to do. In terms of what that means for the future, we don't know. I hope that they find a business case to invest in standalone fixed wireless. What I can tell you is that to the extent that they're using the existing network for fixed wireless, we wouldn't see that broken out. That would just show up as kind of normal business for us.\nThat would just kind of be kind of the normal course of business. To the extent that they started building dedicated fixed wireless assets, that's not something that's been in our viewshed, and it's not in any of our projections. So that would be an upside opportunity for us if they started doing that. But there's no indications today from any of the carriers that they're investing in a separate fixed wireless network at this point.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you.\nThank you. In the interest of time, we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Atkin\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. So I wanted to ask a little bit about inorganic growth, and particularly in Europe. What would be some of the criteria that you would look at to maybe get bigger in some of those developed markets, whether it's scale or valuation, and what's kind of the landscape there and your lens around acquisition? And then back on CoreSite, you made some pretty positive comments. Are we to conclude that you're seeing accelerating growth in, say, cross-connect counts and kilowatt or cabinet growth based on the demand trends that you saw? Anything on book to bill that you can share and other metrics around CoreSite? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. So when it comes to Europe, the first thing that we look for in any market that we're looking at is a healthy carrier ecosystem that supports long-term growth. So we would be looking. We talked about Europe as one thing. It's not. Each country has its own dynamics there.\nSo for us, it's making sure that you have a healthy carrier environment and that you have an environment that supports colocation as a business model. So that's the first criteria. The second thing that we'll look for is to make sure the terms and conditions are something that gives us long-term viability for growth there. And so it's easier to talk about the things that we've passed up on in the past in some of those transactions. So we've seen transactions where you couldn't monetize amendments with the anchor tenant. We've seen transactions where the carriers are right to buy the assets back in a certain number of years. We've seen transactions where they had low-fixed escalators versus CPI-linked. You've had sites that were characterized as kind of golden sites where you couldn't lease them up.\nThose are all things that diminish your opportunity to grow in the future, and those are things that we would pass up on. Then the third criteria is really valuation. Can we drive incremental value by doing a transaction there? There are a number of countries in Europe that we like that we think have got some of those good characteristics. What we've not seen is a portfolio trade that has the right terms and conditions at the right price. So we'll continue to be disciplined on that, and we'll see if any opportunities arise on that. On the CoreSite side, yeah, we continue to see good cross-connect growth. It was high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth in 2025 from cross-connects. We are continuing to see strong and elevated pricing.\nOur mark-to-market is above our historical 2% to 4% range, and our churn's kind of in line with our historical churn range there. So we feel very good about pretty much all the dynamics in CoreSite right now. And like I mentioned earlier, the demand is not waning, and we do see a long tail of that enterprise customer that's going to continue to repatriate workloads from the cloud and continue to repatriate workloads from their own data centers into CoreSite.\n\nJonathan Atkin\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\nThank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to Adam Smith for closing remarks.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, American Tower\n\nThank you all for joining the call today. If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to the investor relations team. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your participation in today's conference.

Welcome to the American Tower Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nI'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO; and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2025 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven O. Vondran\n\nExecutive Vice President and President, U.S. Tower Division, American Tower Corp.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. When I stepped into the CEO role about a year ago, I expressed my excitement about leading American Tower through its next era of growth and evolution. We have an exceptional portfolio of assets, unmatched operating capabilities, and we're in what I believe to be one of the most durable businesses, capitalized by ever-increasing mobile network demand.\nOver the past year, activity across our platform has highlighted the criticality of our communications assets in meeting growing demand as carriers in our U.S. and European markets deployed mid-band spectrum assets, emerging market players densified 4G networks and began rolling out 5G, and our CoreSite data center business delivered yet another record year of new leasing.\nMy original perspective of the 5G cycle requiring continued network investments necessary to support coverage has been realized and bolstered with incremental optimism through the next phase of AI-driven demand, which I believe will benefit our towers and data centers and unlock synergistic value between the 2 at the edge.\nLast year, I also laid out a set of strategic priorities centered on balance sheet stream, efficiency, portfolio quality and capital allocation discipline, all meant to further enhance our customer value proposition and strengthen the durability and quality of earnings for our shareholders over the long term. Certain headwinds in 2024 underscore the importance of these initiatives, which better prepare us to weather challenges like carrier consolidation and FX and interest rate volatility. And although these global risks persist, thanks to significant efforts undertaken by the talented members of our global team, we're entering 2025 in a stronger position, and we'll remain focused on pursuing these strategies to prioritize higher-quality earnings and sustained growth.\nWe're currently on track to maintain our 5x leverage target on a recurring basis this year, which is an acceleration from our initial deleveraging plan following our CoreSite acquisition at the end 2021. In addition to managing our debt and capital structure, our net leverage profile was further supported by margin expansion, which we've largely delivered through systematic reduction of recurring SG&A costs. Cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, reduced by approximately $35 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, supported by various efficiency initiatives, including the thoughtful globalization of company-wide functions like finance, IT and HR.\nMost recently, we appointed Bud Noel as our Chief Operating Officer, a role that will advance our efforts in driving efficiency and margin expansion by ensuring that we effectively leverage global operating expertise, and apply the best of our processes, tools and capabilities across all of our regions. At the same time, we were happy to further leverage our exceptional bench strength that announced Rich Rossi, who spent over 20 years with American Tower, to lead the U.S. and Canada business. Importantly, with these changes, we aim to further elevate the quality of business functions of customer service and anticipate further enhancing our already attractive margin profile along the way.\nWe'll use the next several months to diligently assess the optimal global operating structure and, in time, we'll communicate long-term efficiency targets. We've already made significant progress and we have a long runway of opportunities still ahead.\nOver the past year, we continued to actively manage our global portfolio and forward-looking capital deployment priorities to rightsize geographic risk and ensure a strong synergistic fit between our strategy, core competencies and assets. Most notably, as we discussed on the third quarter call, we exited our India business and has since sold our modest land interest in Australia and New Zealand. We also recently signed an agreement to divest our South Africa fiber business and plan to close that transaction this quarter.\nWe believe the quality of our earnings and growth profile is at a material premium to where we stood only a few years ago. In 2025, we expect our developed markets, which consist of our U.S., Canadian and European operations, along with CoreSite, to contribute about 75% towards our unlevered AFFO, and we expect to further expand this portion through continued prioritization of capital into these developed segments.\nWe've also increased the proportion of global tower cash flows to top operators in each market. Combined with reduced emerging market exposure, this should translate to a more attractive and predictable return profile moving forward.\nOur stronger portfolio and focused capital allocation plan paired with our best-in-class global operating capabilities and alignment with market leaders better enables us to benefit from positive industry trends. Global demand for mobile data continues to climb. The roughly 35% of mobile data traffic that runs over 5G network today is expected to increase to 80% by 2030, prompting carriers to enhance and expand their increasingly stressed networks.\nCurrently, with 5G upgrades that improve spectral efficiency and subsequently with incremental cell sites that will densify their footprints in areas identified as needing additional capacity. In our U.S. tower business, we've observed 4 quarters of sequential acceleration in application activity over the course of 2024, exiting the year with our big 3 customers having upgraded an average of 65% of their sites within our portfolio with mid-band spectrum, up from just over 50% a year ago.\nCarriers have begun to highlight the commercial benefits associated with our 5G investments: translate to enhanced network quality, customer retention and stronger ARPUs, with commentary suggesting another active year of network investment in 2025. In fact, although we're between the 2 peaks of the 5G investment cycle, coverage and capacity, the 2025 outlook for wireless CapEx spend is expected to return to higher levels again, totaling approximately $35 billion, which is roughly $5 billion above the average annual spend in 4G.\nNow as what I'll speak about in a moment, although we anticipate the positive momentum of U.S. activity to continue to 2025 with a solid pipeline supporting it, our outlook for organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. and Canada steps down modestly compared to 2024. This is a function of the cadence of our contracted use fees and also the commencement timing associated with noncontracted new business such as new colocations outside of our MLAs or a customer that may not be under a comprehensive agreement, not a softening in demand.\nSo far, the 5G investment cycle is largely in line with our expectations, with recent carrier commentary, dialogue and activity further reinforcing our conviction in sustained higher CapEx needs moving forward. Over the next 5 years, underwritten by projected total mobile network profit growth of over 15% annually given the existing service terms, we expect the required network capacity to more than double, with more connected devices, data-intensive applications and growing uplink transition requirements placing significant strength in the networks.\nToday, we'd expect roughly half of this incremental capacity need to be solved through current spectrum holdings and real spectral efficiency. That leaves a sizable capacity gap that can only be resolved through densification, additional spectrum coming to market or a combination of both.\nIn addition, mainstream use of new applications, such as multi-mobile AI, could further exacerbate capacity shortages and prompt even more activity. Taken all together, we see an attractive addressable market that our portfolio is well equipped to accommodate with equipment upgrades, colocations and selective new site development over the next several years and beyond.\nSimilar trends generally hold true internationally where true 5G mid-band coverage continues to progress each year and stands at roughly 45% in Europe, 15% in Latin America and 10% in Africa. Data consumption has grown at a CAGR of around mid-teens to roughly 20% across these regions since 2020. And we've seen a corresponding increase in cell site density that complements existing site upgrade efforts. Importantly, these mid-band coverage [ steps ] illustrate the need for continued investment over the next several years.\nAs we anticipate similar annual data growth across these same geographies, carriers will continue to utilize the most cost-effective ways to bolster their network capacity and coverage, which will include a mix of macro towers, rooftop sites, small cells and, in remote areas where terrestrial networks are not economically efficient, satellites.\nIn our CoreSite business, the team delivered a tremendous quarter results around another exceptional year. These results reinforce the strength of the demand and pricing durability for interconnection-centric, retail-oriented colocation. And while we continue to evaluate hyperscale, we remain convinced of our core business model and the tangible demand catalysts we see today, including AI-related demand. This allows us to stay disciplined in our lease-up approach to ensure a high-quality customer mix at the right economics and supports our continued long-term expectation of mid-teens or higher stabilized yields.\nTo build on this momentum in 2025 and beyond and continue to meet the growing needs of our customers across our global platform, we'll maintain the following priorities. First, we continue to evolve our value proposition to our customers and our investment opportunity to our shareholders. I firmly believe that we're the best operator of towers and distributed real estate in the world, which allows us to pass along certain benefits and efficiencies to our customers, including powers of service, security and monitoring, data and asset quality, customer service delivery, speed of deployment and a suite of services capabilities.\nAdditionally, I recognize that investor attraction to American Tower's equity option requires that we operate the highest quality portfolio with strategic fit among our geographies, demonstrate trustworthy stewardship of shareholder capital through disciplined investments, and leverage an operating structure that yields outsized efficiency, margins and returns. We have an incredibly talented team that lets us do that. And further globalizing our organization will drive additional economies of scale, centralization and global automation, draw savings across multiple business functions, ensuring that we're able to continue demonstrating synergistic value creation across our 20-plus markets at an exciting time in global connectivity.\nNext, and as Ron will discuss in more detail, we'll continue to actively manage our capital to prioritize funding of opportunities that yield the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return over the long term. We're continuing to direct most discretionary capital towards our developed market platforms, including over $600 million for data center development on existing campuses underwritten at mid-teens stabilized yields, with some optionality to pursue smaller tuck-in inorganic opportunities were appropriate and also the construction of 6 of our tower sites in Europe, where we anticipate low double-digit day 1 yields.\nAt the same time, we're reducing emerging market discretionary CapEx to just over $300 million in 2025, a reduction of over 60% from 2021 and over 15% compared to 2024. Spend across our Latin America and African/APAC segment will be primarily focused on the construction of about 1,650 previously committed tower sites for strategic customers, underwritten at mid-teens day 1 NOI yields. We expect this number to come down over time as we satisfy those commitments and redirect new discretionary capital to develop regions.\nIn conclusion, macroeconomic uncertainty persists across the global landscape, but consumer demand for connectivity and bandwidth intensive applications and the associated work requirements remain resilient. The macro tower remains the most cost-effective manner to deliver a gigabyte of mobile data, and our global portfolio of assets and leading capabilities exceptionally equips us to support our customers' multiyear investment needs.\nFurther, we've taken appropriate steps to ensure a higher degree of durable growth and returns generated by our leading business.\nI'm confident that our focus on operating and actively managing the highest-quality global portfolio of assets, offering best-in-class customer service and delivery through our experienced global teams and leveraging our investment-grade balance sheet positions American Tower to profit from attractive long-term secular demand trends across the wireless and technology industries and drive sustained quality growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term.\nNow I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss full year '24 results and our 2025 outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Steve, and thank you all for joining the call. We had a strong close to 2024, supported by the execution of our strategic priorities, as Steve highlighted in his remarks. Before I review our 2024 performance, which was in line with prior outlook, and expectations for 2025, I'll touch on several highlights from the quarter.\nFirst, demand for our assets remained solid. In the U.S., while fixed use fees in our comprehensive master lease agreements mean that new business growth is somewhat independent of actual carrier activity levels, we were encouraged to see the sequential acceleration in applications continue through Q4. We view this as critical evidence of the importance of mid-band spectrum and our customers' commitment to achieving portfolio coverage. In fact, Q4 volumes more than doubled year-over-year, reinforcing our conviction that our customers will continue to deploy 5G on their existing sites and densify their networks over the next several years to meet surging data demands.\nInternationally, consistent organic new business contributions were complemented by the construction of nearly 1,000 sites with strategic anchor tenants, which includes record volumes in Europe. In our U.S. data center business, demand for our interconnection campuses and associated new leasing remained elevated, resulting in fourth quarter revenue growth of nearly 10%.\nNext, consistent with past quarters, conversion of consolidated cash top line growth was bolstered by vigilant cost management, supporting year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 200 basis points. As I'll touch on in a moment, our focus on driving cost efficiencies across our global business remains a critical priority and evident in our 2025 outlook.\nFinally, we continue to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In Q4, we opportunistically addressed a portion of our 2025 debt refinancing needs, successfully issuing $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes at an average coupon of 5.2% and average tenor of 7.5 years. Furthermore, our 2025 plan is in line with our net leverage target, and we began the year with a strong liquidity position and reduced floating rate debt exposure, providing flexibility and optionality as we address 2025 maturities.\nAlso, in January, we amended and extended our bank facilities with a leading banking syndicate, which improved our applicable margin pricing by 12.5 basis points on drawn debt to 100 basis points, further optimizing our cost of capital.\nMoving to Slide 6. I'll first remind you that property revenue and adjusted EBITDA exclude discontinued operations associated with our India sale in both the current and prior-year periods. Property revenue growth for the year was nearly 1% and 3% on an FX-neutral basis. Performance was supported by organic tenant billings growth of over 5%, the construction of nearly 2,400 sites and U.S. data center growth of over 10%, partially offset by a 2% negative headwind associated with a reduction in noncash straight-line revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA growth was approximately 2% and over 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth was negatively impacted by 3.5% associated with a reduction in noncash straight line. As we have communicated throughout the year, focus on cost management supported a reduction in cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, of approximately $35 million as compared to 2023, contributing to cash margin expansion of 140 basis points to 66.8%, demonstrating our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our global organization.\nFinally, attributable AFFO per share of $10.54 represented nearly 7% growth year-over-year and over 9% on an FX-neutral basis.\nI'll now summarize a few key points and themes to contextualize our 2025 outlook. First, the drivers supporting our plan are generally consistent with the preliminary indications we provided on our Q3 2024 earnings call. As you'll see on Slide 7, solid recurring revenue growth with elevated conversion rates to AFFO through strategic global cost management initiatives spanning operating expenses, SG&A, maintenance CapEx and cash taxes, fundamentally position our 2025 plan in line with our long-term growth algorithm, partially offset by FX devaluation and interest costs associated with refinancing needs.\nAlthough FX and interest rates have proven to be volatile and unique considerations could move results above or below our mid- to high single-digit growth rate target in any given year, we believe our business is positioned to deliver solid, durable recurring AFFO per share growth and attractive returns. And we're committed to actively managing the portfolio to ensure that expectation is achieved.\nNext, as Steve mentioned, we recently signed an agreement to sell our fiber assets in South Africa, which we assume to close on March 1 in our outlook, highlighting another step towards enhancing our portfolio of quality and focus. Annualized contributions from the South Africa fiber business were approximately $25 million and $20 million in property revenue and adjusted EBITDA, respectively.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our 2025 outlook reflects total company organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5%, and around 5.5% absent the impacts of the final tranche of Sprint churn. Organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be greater than or equal to 4.3%, and greater than or equal to 5.3% excluding the impacts of Sprint churn, a modest reduction compared to 2024 as contracted use fees stepped down and contributions from noncontracted leasing, which is sensitive to commencement timing, begin to accelerate.\nGrowth includes contributions from organic new business in the mid-3% range and a 3% escalator, partially offset by non-Sprint related churn and other adjustments of roughly 1%. It's important to note that our guide assumes the first 3 quarters of 2025 will be impacted by approximately 140 basis points of Sprint churn, likely keeping growth below 4% during that time period, before recovering to over 5.5% in Q4 which will not have any negative growth impacts from Sprint churn.\nGrowth in Africa and APAC of approximately 12% includes roughly 7% in escalators, 6% organic new business as ongoing 4G densification and initial 5G upgrades continue, and less than 1% in other billings adjustments, partially offset by approximately 2% in churn, which is a notable improvement from prior years.\nGrowth in Europe of approximately 5% includes 2% in escalators and steady organic new business contributions of around 4%, partially offset by churn of approximately 1%.\nIn Latin America, growth of approximately 2% includes contributions from escalators of around 5% and organic new business of over 2%. Gross growth is partially offset by another year of carrier consolidation-driven churn, which we expect to persist through 2027. Resulting in elevated churn of approximately 5% in 2025 and other billing adjustments of less than 1%.\nTurning to Slide 9. You'll see organic tenant billings is supporting property revenue growth of over 0.5% or approximately 3% on an FX-neutral basis, which is impacted by a year-over-year FX-neutral reduction of $217 million in straight-line revenue and over 2% negative headwind to reported growth.\nComplementing organic tower growth, net of a reduction due to the nonrecurrence of certain onetime revenue benefits in 2024 is a continuation of solid performance in our U.S. data center business, growing at nearly 12% at the midpoint.\nMoving to Slide 10. Cash property revenue growth is converting at a high rate to adjusted EBITDA, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 1% and over 3% on an FX-neutral basis, which includes an approximately 3% negative headwind associated with noncash straight line. Complementing property contributions, we anticipate the positive momentum we saw in our U.S. services segment in 2024 to continue into 2025, resulting in an increase to services gross margin of nearly $30 million.\nThe operating leverage inherent in our business model is expected to be amplified by prudent cost controls and lower bad debt expense, including another year of cash SG&A declines of approximately $20 million.\nTurning to Slide 11. 2025 attributable AFFO per share of $10.40 represents growth of over 4% relative to 2024 attributable AFFO per share as adjusted of $9.96 and growth of approximately 7% on an FX-neutral basis. Performance is supported by a strong conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth through tightly managed cash taxes and maintenance CapEx, partially offset by net interest headwinds of $80 million, a roughly 1.7% negative impact to growth.\nOn Slide 12, I'll review our capital allocation plans for 2025. We expect to resume dividend growth in the mid-single-digit range subject to Board approval, which corresponds to an approximately $3.2 billion distribution to our shareholders.\nNext, we're planning for $1.7 billion in capital deployment, of which $1.5 billion is discretionary in nature and includes the construction of 2,250 sites at the midpoint. Approximately 80% of our discretionary spend is centered on our developed market platforms, including over $600 million in success-based investments towards our data center campuses to replenish the record level of capacity sold over the past several years, increased spend in the U.S., primarily towards land buyouts under our tower sites, and continued acceleration in European new tower construction with 600 new sites planned.\nWhile overall capital spend is moderately increasing year-to-year as we execute on attractive development opportunities across the U.S., Europe and CoreSite, we continue to reduce spend across our emerging markets. In 2025, investments in Latin America, Africa and APAC will primarily consist of augmenting sites to accommodate incremental tenants in meeting multiyear agreement obligations with leading carriers primarily through new builds.\nExecution of our strategic balance sheet priority since closing the CoreSite acquisition has us well-positioned to deliver more sustained and durable earnings growth, partially mitigate market risk and volatility, and provide financial flexibility to execute on opportunistic and strategic growth opportunities at an attractive cost of capital.\nOur liquidity position of $12 billion, including $10 billion of bank facility capacity, along with our low floating debt exposure, provides optionality to manage the $3.7 billion of fixed note maturities in 2025. Our plan continues to target maintaining floating rate debt exposure below 10%, which we believe is a reasonable target for the foreseeable future.\nMoving to Slide 13, and in summary. Our fundamental business proved resilient throughout a volatile macroeconomic backdrop in 2024 as carriers continue to invest in their networks across our global footprint to address growing mobile data demand. Although market volatility continues to persist, including interest rate and FX uncertainty, the quality of our assets, people, counterparties and contract terms, combined with the strategic steps we executed over the course of 2024 to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance earnings quality, have us well positioned to deliver stronger growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term.\nWith that, operator, we can open the line for questions.",

Welcome to the American Tower Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nIf you'd like to ask a question, please press one, then zero now. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and FP&A, American Tower\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Q2 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO, and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.\nExamples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business, and the expected impacts of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time to time with the SEC.\nWe urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nGood morning, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As you can see in our Q2 results and our revised full-year outlook, we've continued to build on the strength we saw in the underlying business at the outset of the year, with further validation of our initial expectations for strong activity across our platforms in 2024. I want to start today's remarks by thanking our teams across the globe for their commitment to operational excellence and dedication to maximizing sales, bringing down costs, and expanding margins across the portfolio.\nMy comments today will focus on our latest views on our international portfolio and aim to address some of the recurring questions related to our international strategy in both developed and emerging markets that we've received from investors in recent months. As we've communicated in the past, our international investment thesis is two-pronged. First, we see that the fundamentals that have driven performance in the US, such as ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption and a business model that benefits from tremendous operating leverage, generally hold true across international markets. Second, by exporting our successful US model through investments in a diversified portfolio of assets that balance various risk and return profiles, we expect to expand and augment our long-term growth potential. Executing on this thesis has resulted in a footprint that includes diverse and sometimes complicated geographies. Entering these markets as a US.\nBusiness involves creating value while solving for two types of risk: operational and financial. On the operational front, I can confidently tell you that we have the best operating teams in each geography across our portfolio, and we've overcome operational risks on a consistent basis through our shared global expertise and experience. In many cases, we leverage operating challenges to create new business opportunities, enhance existing, or introduce new competitive advantages. This capability has been demonstrated through our reliable speed-to-market delivery on new tower builds, a global reputation and sophisticated regulatory approach that has afforded opportunities to effectively assess new markets and assets, and the development of an innovative power-to-service model that provides best-in-class network uptime and supports initiatives among American Tower, our M&O customers, and the communities we serve to deliver clear telecommunications networks.\nThis is one of the key synergies American Tower brings: an unmatched global knowledge and support platform to create value through operational excellence. Our investors benefit from our ability to utilize that platform to realize expanded market share of new business, drive best-in-class margins, and leverage cost-to-capital advantages derived from our global balance sheet. When you take all these together, these benefits translate to an enhanced value of the assets under the American Tower umbrella, commanding a premium relative to the market-implied sum of the parts on a comparable basis. And where this has not held true, we've taken corrective actions, which I'll touch on a little bit later. As I mentioned in previous remarks, our exposure to financial risk has been more acute in our emerging market portfolio, particularly over the past several years, as global macroeconomic factors have had an outsized impact on emerging markets.\nIn many cases, those financial risks have, quite frankly, outpaced what we originally underwrote, and together with carrier consolidation, have contributed to financial results in certain emerging markets that fall short of our standards. We're taking action to improve those results. We've talked previously about our focus on cost controls, and I'm happy to say that those are paying off. At the midpoint of our guidance this year, we anticipate savings of over $40 million in SG&A, excluding bad debt, relative to 2023. Our emerging market footprint has been a meaningful contributor to our cost-efficiency progress to date, where we're shifting our focus from aggressively growing those portfolios to maximizing the return on our investments. We've also previously commented on raising the hurdle rates for the deployment of additional capital in those markets.\nThese proactive actions and a refined strategic focus have corresponded to an expected 2024 reduction of over 40% in discretionary capital across Latin America, Africa, and APAC compared to 2021. Conversely, in parts of our developed market footprint, such as Europe and now Canada, we're underwriting compelling mid-teen US dollar yields. We're increasing our investments alongside our capital partners. With an expanded developed market platform inclusive of the US and Canada, we've been able to more than double our discretionary capital in those markets over the same period. As a result, as you can see on slide six, the allocation toward emerging markets has reduced from around 2/3 of our total in 2021 to less than 1/3 in our 2024 guidance. You'll likely see that number continue to trend down as we satisfy some of our previously contracted obligations in certain markets.\nComplementing our approach to discretionary capital allocation and supporting our proactive steps to enhance our global portfolio, in 2023, we divested non-core, subscale, or underperforming assets like Mexico Fiber and our Poland operations. Earlier this year, we announced our pending exit from India. Additionally, over the past several years, we've further expanded our developed market exposure through our M&A focus across the US and Europe, all just to name a few examples of the key strategic actions we've taken to date. Pro forma for the anticipated sale of our India business, our attributable AFFO exposure to emerging markets will be approximately 25%. As a result of these actions, and those I'll touch on later, we believe our emerging market operations and our business as a whole are in a better position to deliver the higher quality, sustainable earnings growth that makes investing in communications infrastructure so compelling.\nHowever, given the impacts of the financial risks and the stability and quality of earnings our investors rightfully demand from the tower and communications infrastructure models, we expect to further reduce our relative exposure to emerging markets over time as we continue to focus on incremental investments in developed economies. Now, that doesn't mean that you should assume that we plan to divest in particular markets. While our full management team and our board regularly assess all options, including divestitures, and we're going to remain opportunistic as we continue to actively manage our portfolio, we believe today that more long-term value is created by continuing to operate these portfolios, expand our gross margins, and reduce capital intensity while repatriating cash flows to fund other global priorities, such as deleveraging, paying our dividend, developed market investments with the highest quality return profiles, and looking ahead to potential for share buybacks.\nMeanwhile, continued operation of these portfolios means that we retain the optionality to reinvest into those markets if economic conditions and growth outlooks evolve. With that in mind, here's what we're focused on in our international segment going forward. First, just as in the US, owning and operating the highest quality assets and partnering with leading carriers in each market helps provide more stable growth and reduce long-term earning volatility resulting from consolidation. This is a critical lesson learned from our experience in India, where consolidation posed significant headwinds to growth over a multi-year period. Today, the vast majority of our revenues in Europe, Africa, and Latin America come from leading customers with competitive in-market scale.\nMeaningful enhancements to our counterparty profile over the past several years have come in part due to carrier consolidation, but also as a result of proactively aligning growth initiatives and capital allocation, whether through development or M&A, toward doing business with market leaders. We remain committed to growing with tier-one global M&Os across our footprint. In some cases, particularly where growth capital is not required, we may also support network rollouts of new entrants or smaller operators. However, anytime we assess expansion CapEx for carriers that fit this profile, the underwriting standards will be adjusted to account for potential incremental risks on a case-by-case basis. Next, scale is perhaps the most critical component of the international value creation flywheel. At a high level, our scale allows us to operate more profitably by leveraging shared overhead and a global balance sheet that creates cost-to-capital advantages.\nImportantly, scale also enables us to develop nationwide agreements that present a differentiated go-to-market solution for leading M&Os at contract terms that we view as critical. In particular, securing full lease-up rights on the assets we acquire, including the ability to monetize both colocation and amendment activity, is crucial to our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Over the past decade, we've encountered stale lease-back opportunities with restrictive contract terms that limit the lease-up monetization. These terms are non-starters for us. Similarly, while recent currency devaluations in certain markets have exceeded our initial underwriting expectations, CPI-linked escalators have proven to be a critical tool to help mitigate long-term currency risk over the last decade. As we look forward to the balance of 2024 and the next several years, we believe we're uniquely positioned to create differentiated value for our customers.\nTo maximize the benefits of the scale portfolio we have in place, we're reinforcing a customer service-driven approach to everything we do. Our internal departments in each region are focused on supporting our sales team's ability to sign new business with market leaders and deliver strong organic growth. Further, our global model allows our best-in-class operating teams to remain flexible in addressing the ebbs and flows in demand through cross-border shared resources, allowing for sustained speed-to-market delivery for our customers while also supporting our focus on cost management. To that end, we remain committed to extending the global efficiency and cost management achievements we've made to date. Since 2018 and at the midpoint of our 2024 outlook, we expect to reduce cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, as a percentage of revenue by roughly 210 basis points in Europe, Africa, and Latin America in aggregate.\nWe're now in the process of further globalizing our business functions to identify additional areas where we can leverage scale and technology to support continued growth and customer service in the most cost-efficient manner. In closing, we believe we have an opportunity to leverage our learnings from the last 2+ decades of global operations to continue managing and developing a best-in-class business that's capable of delivering high-quality, long-term earnings growth. We're going to continue actively managing our portfolio to ensure a compelling mix of geographies and assets that are well-positioned to support and monetize growing data demand, and where our operating capabilities can continue to serve as a sustained competitive advantage. As our actions have demonstrated over the past year, we're prepared to make appropriate strategic decisions to ensure that we have a portfolio of the highest quality.\nGoing forward, we believe that through a focus on maximizing organic growth, disciplined and flexible reinvestment of cash flows into growth opportunities, and further leveraging our global scale to maximize profitability and returns, we can provide a value proposition that can't be replicated elsewhere, translating into expanded returns on capital over time. With that, I'll hand it over to Rod to discuss future results and our revised outlook.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As highlighted in this morning's press release, we had a strong Q2 driven by the resilient demand for our assets and resulting in robust performance across several key areas.\nGiven the critical nature of our global portfolio and the growth trends in mobile data consumption, we head into the back half of the year confident in our ability to drive strong growth, execute on our cost management initiatives, enhance our quality of earnings, and deliver compelling total shareholder returns. Before I discuss the specifics of our Q2 results and revised full-year outlook, I'll summarize a few of the highlights. First, activity levels on our tower assets remain strong. Our consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% continues to demonstrate the strength of the fundamentals that fuel our business. Our US services segment performed in line with our expectations for accelerating tower activity in 2024, with revenues and gross profit each increasing over 50% versus Q1 and more than double that of Q4 of 2023.\nNext, CoreSite executed another exceptionally strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth, their second-highest quarter of signed new leasing in the company's history, and record cash backlog. Additionally, our data center projects currently under development are roughly 60% pre-leased, four times the historical average, providing confidence and visibility to an accelerated pathway to realizing CoreSite's best-in-class returns on invested capital. Furthermore, in India, the positive collection trends we saw over the last several quarters continued in Q2, allowing us to reverse approximately $67 million of previously reserved revenue and clearing the majority of the outstanding AR we have with a key customer. Separately, we made further progress in accelerating certain payments included in the approximately $2.5 billion of potential total proceeds associated with our pending sale of ATC India.\nIn the quarter, we repatriated more than $210 million back to the US, and we are in the process of repatriating an additional approximately $20 million, largely associated with the monetization of the VIL OCDs net of fees. To date, total accelerated proceeds stands at approximately $345 million, inclusive of funds received in Q1, and we expect the remaining proceeds, potentially of approximately $2.1 billion, to be received at closing. As we make progress towards closing, which we continue to target H2 2024, we anticipate incurring incremental costs within the business between SG&A and Maintenance CapEx, a modest offset to the upside realized through strong collections. I will touch on these items and how they impact our outlook later.\nFinally, we continue to effectively execute on our balance sheet initiatives, highlighted in the quarter by the issuance of €1 billion euro denominated senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 4%. The proceeds were used to pay down floating rate debt, lowering our ratio back to 89% fixed to 11% floating. Turning to Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide 8, consolidated property revenue growth was 4.6%, or over 6.5% excluding non-cash straight-line revenue, while absorbing roughly 230 basis points of FX headwinds. US and Canada property revenue growth was approximately 1%, or over 4% excluding straight-line, and includes an approximately 1% negative impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 7%, or over 12% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes an over 8% benefit associated with improved collections in India.\nFinally, data center revenues increased over 12% as demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues unabated. AI-driven demand picks up, and the backlog of record new business signed over the last two years continues to commence. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.3%, supported by strong demand for our assets across our global portfolio. In our US and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and over 6% absent Sprint-related churn. We expect a relatively similar growth rate in Q3 before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation of approximately 4.7%. Our international segment drove 5.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting additional moderation in CPI-linked escalators as expected, and a sequential step down in colocation and amendment contributions, most notably in APAC.\nHowever, in Europe, we saw another quarter of accelerating new business, moving organic tenant billings growth in the region to 5.7% and giving us confidence to modestly raise our full-year outlook for the segment, which I'll touch on shortly. Turning to slide 9, adjusted EBITDA grew 8.1%, or nearly 12% excluding the impacts of non-cash straight-line, while absorbing approximately 210 basis points in FX headwinds. Cash adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 64.7%, which includes a roughly 80 basis point benefit in the quarter associated with India reserve reversals as compared to a drag of nearly 50 basis points in the year-ago period. Absent these one-time items, we're continuing to demonstrate meaningful cash margin improvements supported by the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and continued cost management throughout the business.\nIn fact, cash SG&A excluding bad debt declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 13.5% and 13.4% respectively, supported by a high conversion of cash-adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. Now, shifting to our revised full-year outlook, I'll start with a few key updates. First, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a strong start to the year. Core performance remains solid, and our continued focus on driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the business is paying off through exceptional conversion rates of top-line results through Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. As you'll see in the next several slides, our core results to date and expectations for the remainder of the year are contributing to outperformance across key metrics for 2024 as compared to our prior expectations.\nNext, having now come off several consecutive quarters of solid collections in India, we've reassessed expectations for the year. In our prior outlook, we had assumed nearly $50 million in revenue reserves from Q2 to Q4, or just over $16 million per quarter. As I mentioned earlier, through positive collections in Q2, we've reversed $67 million of previously reserved revenue, translating to an upside of $84 million as compared to our prior outlook assumption for the quarter. We now have confidence to fully remove our previous reserve assumption for the second half of the year, representing an incremental $32 million in upside, which, together with Q2 results, is driving an outlook-to-outlook increase of around $116 million across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and attributable AFFO.\nFinally, we have revised our FX assumptions, providing an incremental headwind of $51 million, $33 million, and $28 million to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and attributable AFFO respectively. Turning to slide 10, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million compared to prior outlook. Outperformance includes $116 million associated with positive collection trends in India, partially offset by a decrease of $45 million, which consists of a decrease of $58 million in pass-through, primarily due to fuel costs, net of an increase of $13 million in straight-line revenue. Consolidated core property revenue remains unchanged, with certain offsetting movements between segments. Growth was partially also offset by $51 million associated with negative FX impacts. Moving to slide 11, expectations for consolidated US and Canada total international and APAC organic tenant billings growth remain unchanged.\nHowever, we have raised expectations for Africa to greater than 12% and Europe to approximately 6%, up from 11% to 12% and 5% to 6% respectively. In addition, we have lowered our expectations for Latin America to greater than 1.5%, down from approximately 2%. Turning to slide 12, we are increasing our Adjusted EBITDA outlook by $130 million as compared to the prior outlook. Outperformance is driven by the flow-through of FX-neutral property revenue upside and direct expense savings, partially offset by additional SG&A costs in India, and $33 million of FX headwinds. Moving to slide 13, we are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $85 million at the midpoint and $0.18 on a per-share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.60. Cash adjusted EBITDA outperformance is partially offset by incremental maintenance CapEx split between the US and Canada, where we're prioritizing certain incremental projects, and India.\nGrowth is partially offset by $28 million in FX headwinds. Excluding India, outperformance on an FX-neutral basis was $27 million as compared to prior outlook. Turning to slide 14, you'll see our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, including unchanged expectations for our 2024 dividend distribution, which is subject to board approval. On the capital program side, we are increasing our plan for 2024 by $55 million, which includes $30 million associated with Maintenance CapEx, as I previously mentioned, and additional success-based development investments in our US data center business to maximize sellable capacity on the back of ongoing record demand. Additionally, we have reallocated certain discretionary capital buckets, including an increase towards our strategically important US land acquisition program, partially offset by savings and redevelopment. Moving to the right side of the slide, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and accelerating our pathway to additional financial flexibility.\nThis commitment is demonstrated through our successful execution in the capital markets, including the issuance of over $2 billion in fixed-rate debt since the start of the year. A strategic and disciplined approach towards our capital deployment priorities highlighted reductions in discretionary capital spend in each of the last several years. Together, with a rebalancing of strategic priorities between geographies and risk profiles and a continued cost focus across the business, these strategic actions have translated into meaningful progress towards achieving our net leverage target and an improved fixed-to-floating-rate debt profile over the past 24 months. Turning to slide 15, and in summary, we are pleased with our execution through the first half of the year, demonstrating the strength of the fundamentals that underpin our business through solid organic growth and a diligent focus on cost management throughout our company.\nCombined with our prudent approach to capital allocation, while reinforcing and enhancing our balance sheet strength and financial flexibility, we believe we are well-positioned to drive strong, sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value while being a best-in-class operation for our stakeholders across the globe. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nMD, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks a lot. Good morning, Steve.\nThanks for the comments on the international strategy approach. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of an update on how you're seeing the opportunities to do additional M&A in the US, Europe, and other developed markets. What are you seeing in terms of interesting properties? When the SBA last night was talking about potential for material deals, are you seeing the same thing here? How are valuations looking? And then related to that on data centers, you're continuing to invest heavily in that business. Do you see opportunities for inorganic expansion beyond some of the small tuck-ins you've done either in the US and/or Europe? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah, thanks, Simon. So with respect to the material M&A in the US and Europe, there are some rumors of portfolios becoming available. And so I won't comment on any specific portfolios out there.\nBut what I would reiterate is we're very focused on our current capital allocation priorities and, in particular, delivering down below five. Now, we did get below five this quarter as a result of some of the one-time items, but that'll likely go up above five next quarter. So we're focused on getting durably below five. And we're also focused on our internal CapEx programs and the other capital priorities we've laid out there. And at this point, we haven't seen anything that we've evaluated that would take us off those priorities. So there's nothing that we're evaluating today that would be compelling for us today. And just as a reminder, anything that we would buy would need to be better than buying back our own stock.\nSo when we look at those acquisition opportunities, we have to see an opportunity for that one plus one to equal three versus just growth for growth's sake. So while we're very interested in trying to grow our portfolios in the US and Europe and pretty much any of the developed markets that we're in, we aren't seeing opportunities today that look to be the right price, the right asset group for us to see that synergy that would give us that opportunity today. Having said that, our teams are always evaluating everything out there, and anything that comes to market, we'll evaluate. And if that evaluation changes, we'll let you guys know.\nWhen it comes to CoreSite, we have a lot of opportunity to invest in our existing campuses, and that's going to give us the best return with the lowest risk of any CapEx that we can deploy. Just to put a fine point on it, we've got 44MW under construction today, and 61% of that's pre-leased. So there's quite a bit of CapEx going into those campuses today that we feel very confident that we're going to get our mid-teens stabilized yields or better in those campuses that we're investing in. There are some tuck-ins. Miami is one example. Whenever you see us do that, the reason for us to do a tuck-in market like that is to try to build a new campus. We're very committed to our business model.\nWe think it gives us the most resilient asset, the one that has the most durability over time and the best returns. And if we can create more campuses that have high interconnection, cloud on-ramps, and that ecosystem that commands a premium in the market, we'll try to develop those. Now, those take time to develop, and so we do start small. And that's what you're more likely to see with us. Again, we're very committed to our business model of being an interconnection hub, and there aren't many inorganic opportunities that would contribute to that model. If something did come available that fit that profile, we'd look at it. But today, we think we have ample opportunity to invest in that core business that's performing so well for us.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nSimon, good morning. This is Rod.\nMaybe I'll just add and complement what Steve is saying with a couple of numbers on CapEx for the data center business. So notwithstanding the fact that our overall CapEx program year-over-year has come down because of our capital priorities and the focus on balance sheet strength, delivering all the things Steve talked about. Notwithstanding that decline, we have increased our investments, our CapEx investments in CoreSite for 2024 over 2023 by roughly $100 million. We did the same 2023 over 2022. So we are seeing very compelling opportunities. We are following those and leaning in. The numbers in the grand scheme of things are meaningful, albeit modest, but we do have the ability to dynamically allocate that capital. And just because you see our CapEx program go down somewhat, it doesn't mean we're not leaning into the very best opportunities to deploy CapEx.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nMD, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Very clear. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks, and good morning. A couple of questions. First, I'm just curious if you can unpack a bit more of what you're seeing in the US leasing environment with respect to geography, types of activity between densification and amendments, and where AMT may be differentiating itself and its results relative to the commentary that we hear from some of your competitors. And then secondly, just curious your current view on dividend policy exiting 2024 and how that should relate to the level and growth of AFFO per share over time. Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. So in the US, we're seeing 2024 play out much as we expected. We've seen a modest increase in application volume Q2 over Q1. It is fairly broad-based.\nThe main driver continues to be our carrier customers continuing to build out their 5G networks. So it is largely still amendment-driven, although we do see an uptick somewhat in new colocations over prior years. I wouldn't point to that as quite a densification phase yet. There's still a lot of room for the carriers to continue to expand their 5G presence. And while we're not getting specific about individual carriers, we would say that over half of our sites are now upgraded with mid-band 5G, but one carrier is ahead of the other two. And we have one that's over 80%, one that's a little over 60% now, and one that's a little bit further behind. So there's a lot of runway there for them to continue to roll out mid-band 5G across the portfolio, and we expect them to continue to do that.\nWith respect to our services guide, we are holding our guide for the year. Now, there's always a degree of risk in that services guide because it's near-term, but what we're seeing in our application flow and our services pipeline is supportive of that full-year guide. So we do still feel good about the US activity levels hitting those levels that we saw at the beginning of the year. I believe the carrier capital spend projections are right in line with that; $34 to 36 billion is what they've said publicly. And that's, again, supportive of a level of development that we think is typical of this phase of a build. So we feel good about the US, and we think we're going to continue to see that uptick.\nWe're also seeing usage patterns by the consumer continue to drive demand on those networks, and we're seeing the continued drive of that 20% to 30% uptick in consumer demand that's going to continue to put pressure on the networks. We're seeing that 5G is working for the carriers. It's letting them produce more gigabytes at lower cost. So we think that that's going to continue to be a compelling business proposition for them to build 5G. And with the addition of fixed wireless and some of the positive trends we're seeing in ARPUs and things like that, we're very confident that the US market will continue to grow and build, and that densification phase will come. Oh, sorry, the dividend question.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nMichael, this is Rod. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nSo I'll start over, Michael. Thank you. This is Rod. So regarding the dividend, everyone on the call knows that in 2024, we chose to hold the dividend flat. The reasons behind that really was, given the macroeconomic backdrop, the uncertainty around rates, we decided to favor balance sheet strength, operational growth, and organic growth. And it was one of many things that we decided to do as we leaned into delivering. We really focused on driving organic growth.\nWe were focused on expanding margins, controlling direct expenses, focused on actually reducing SG&A, becoming more efficient, reducing costs, and reducing our overall CapEx program and our CapEx investments, holding the dividend flat, and putting the extra funds that we had into delivering and into reducing exposure to floating rate debt in the environment. So that was one of many things that we did. When you think about going forward into beyond 2024, of course, it's too early to talk about specific guidance for 2025 or beyond. I would remind you and everyone that we target our dividend distribution to equal about 100% of our pre-tax income. That's an important point. From a long-term perspective, I would say that we see pre-tax income growing in line with AFFO and AFFO per share growth on average and over time.\nYou can think about the trajectory in terms of the growth rate of the dividend being similar to the trajectory and the growth rate of AFFO and AFFO per share. That doesn't mean it will match every single year, but over a multi-year period and on average, we believe that it will match up pretty well. Certainly, the dividend is a meaningful piece of the overall total shareholder return that we look to deliver. And as always, anything with respect to our dividend and dividend policy needs to be approved by the board, certainly. So that's the way we think about it. We would expect that the dividend growth would resume in 2025 based on what we're seeing in the numbers going beyond 2024.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nHead of Telecommunication Services and Media Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nRic.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nHead of Telecommunication Services and Media Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nA couple of questions. A couple of questions on my side. Thanks for the update on the India collections process. Nice to get that money on hand. And what's left at closing? How should we think about the status of that approval process? And then how long, once you get through the competitive committee in India, would it take to close the transaction?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nAt this point, Ric, there's no update on that. We're still waiting for the approval. And what we've said consistently is we believe it'll be the second half of the year closing. So not sure when that's going to come out. It's hard to predict, but we do still anticipate getting that in that relative time frame.\nAnd in terms of closing afterwards, yeah, I think you could expect that to occur in four to six weeks afterwards, somewhere in that time frame.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nHead of Telecommunication Services and Media Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nMakes sense. Probably tied to a month end or a quarter end too, just for the accounting purposes, probably.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. If we had that choice, Ric, we probably would. We'll see exactly how it unfolds.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nHead of Telecommunication Services and Media Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Second question. Thanks for the update on the mid-band spectrum deployment in the US. That's helpful to see at least some over half the sites and how it varies by carrier. Internationally, any update there when your competitors, peers suggested that obviously international is way behind those numbers? Any broad strokes as where's 5G deployment internationally is at?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. I'll give a little bit of color on that. I think it depends on the geography that you're in.\nIf you look at Europe, they've been able to deploy 5G to a large proportion of the population there. I think high 80s, low 90s in Spain and Germany for the most part. That's a combination of low and mid-band spectrum, though. So there's still a runway of continued opportunity there to get the mid-band deployed there. I don't have specific stats on the percentage of mid-band because it's a little bit more nuanced in that market. And in France, we have one carrier that's a little bit further ahead in terms of 5G than the other. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag there. When you look at Africa, you are seeing some 5G deployments in some of the major cities, but it's still pretty nascent there. They're still focused on their 4G networks, augmenting those and improving the network quality over time.\nBut we do think that you'll see 5G being deployed there, especially where the population centers are over time. So there's still some runway there for those 5G upgrades to occur in Africa. In Latin America, you have a little bit of 5G that's been deployed in Brazil and a couple of the other markets, but most of those markets are a little bit further behind. And even in Brazil, I'd say it's probably nascent in terms of the 5G deployments today. In many of those markets, there's been a delay in getting 5G spectrum in the hands of the carriers. Some of that is auctions that have been delayed, and some of it is the carriers pushing for a lower entry price there. And so I think as we see that play out over time, we'll continue to see more opportunity there.\nThe other thing that's happening in Brazil is the incumbents there are still integrating the OI assets they bought, and that's depressing the activities there a little bit as they deal with those integrations and combining those networks together. So I'd say it's very consistent with the way we view the international markets, that they're a little bit behind the developed markets and the deployment of 5G. We are starting to see some green shoots in some of those markets where they need those cheaper gigabytes that 5G delivers, and we're seeing some deployments there, but there's a lot of runway ahead to deploy it there.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nHead of Telecommunication Services and Media Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nGreat. The last one for me, I think on the cost management side, is site decommissioning one of the things that's helping to drive that? It looked like some significant decommissionings in the US, Canada.\nMaybe it's related to Sprint towers that are naked once they get off them. Just maybe a little update on what you're doing with decommissioning towers and how that's benefiting costs and how we should think about running that forward.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ric. We're looking at everything in terms of cost management. And our goal is to enhance our margin profile by direct cost savings in addition to SG&A. So what you're seeing there is exactly what you would expect. We're looking at that portfolio and where we have underperforming assets that we don't think are going to see near-term activity. We are decommissioning those to save the OpEx on those and doing what's right. So we are doing some accelerated work there. Rod, did you want to touch on some of the other elements?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. I'll just add in there.\nIn terms of the decommissioning, I think you'll see in the numbers in LatAm, we took down about 250 sites in the US. We took down about 300. That's just normal portfolio pruning and managing the portfolio from time to time. We certainly have sites without tenants on them here and there, and we'll try to lease those up again. And if it doesn't work, we end up taking them down to save the cost. So that is a driver, but it's not the only driver. We're also seeing lower land rent escalations. That was certainly good. We're doing some things with property tax, which resulted in a one-time reduction, which was certainly good. And in our CapEx, we're leaning into investing in our ground leases and reducing ground expense. So that's another area where we're allocating capital to the most accretive and value-creating opportunities.\nSo we're seeing lower land rents based on capital allocation. So there's a number of different things that are playing into that direct cost reduction.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nHead of Telecommunication Services and Media Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Appreciate the call. Thanks, guys.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ric.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGuys. Thanks so much for taking the question. So you guys made this bold prediction about activity levels and services accelerating through the course of the year. Not everyone, I think, is seeing the same thing. Assuming that the service revenue guide is still $195 million, it implies yet another big step up into the second half on a quarterly basis. But the temptation would then be to extrapolate that as a leading indicator for leasing activity. But as I understand it, the MLAs already contemplate all that.\nSo by the end of the quarter, this activity might foreshadow some increased leasing, but because of the MLAs, you might not see that same sensitivity. So if you could validate that perspective. And then a related question is the holistic MLA that you guys signed with AT&T in September 2019, theoretically, if it's a five-year term, it's going to be coming up for renewal or not in Q3. You've highlighted that these holistic MLAs typically have far shorter durations than your underlying core MLAs. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what this means for the business outlook in H2 and into 2025. Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Let me start with the services piece of that.\nSo our Q1 services gross margin was about twice what our Q4 2023 was, and our Q2 was about 50% up from Q1. So we are seeing acceleration in that services business. And again, we believe from the pipeline that we're looking at today that we're on track to hit our full-year services guide on that. And again, there's risk in that services pipeline, and we've seen it play out a couple of times in the past, but our teams are confident at this point that we're on track to be able to do that. With respect to our MLAs, what we've disclosed is that we had one customer that rolled off the MLA earlier this year. And so we haven't really talked specifically about anything beyond that. But because we've telegraphed that pretty clearly, I think you can get an idea that that's where we are.\nThose comprehensive portions are typically three to five years, so it's not just five years. There's a different range on those. Since we do have one customer that's off of that use right fee that underpins that smoothing out of growth over time, that customer is a little bit more dependent on the volumes that they're doing. So there will be a little bit more peaks and valleys in terms of activity with them. But we're convinced that we're fine either way on that. We take a long-term view of these agreements, and if getting into another holistic type agreement makes sense, we will. If we don't think it does, we'll stay and pay by the drink. We're very confident in our ability to monetize it that way.\nWith respect to the activity and how that translates into our organic growth over time, it's too early to be giving a 2025 guide at this point. We'll do that in February, like we always do. But we are encouraged by the growth that we see in terms of the activity by the carriers. We do have one major customer who is off the holistic portion of their agreement. They still have an underlying MLA, but the holistic portion is expired. And so if those volumes continue, that's a positive. We also have what we call our vertical market segment, which are smaller customers. And that's also very much dependent on volume and timing on that. And we're seeing good activity there as well. So we're encouraged by that.\nWhen we look out into the future, we do have a level of contractually locked-in growth for 2025 via our comprehensive MLAs. And that's similar to what we see in 2024, as well as consistent growth from the escalator of about 3%. On the churn side, in 2025, we're going to continue to see a level of elevated Sprint churn. The final tranche of that Sprint churn commences in Q4 of this year. That's about $70 million of annualized monthly run rate. And that will impact our growth rates through Q3 of next year. In terms of the swing factors that you would see in terms of 2025, there's a portion of the growth that's not locked in via the comprehensive MLAs. Again, I mentioned one of the big three carriers and the vertical markets. So that's a swing factor.\nWe also have our eye on the timing and scale of any potential churn from U.S. Cellular over the next couple of years in the event that that deal is approved and closes. We'd expect the overlap to be modest, but the timing and the scale of that churn could put some pressure on rates temporarily. And who knows? We could end up signing another comprehensive MLA or another agreement that would also potentially impact what that number looks like. So there's a number of swing factors for 2025, and that's why we can't really give guidance until we get to February. But at the end of the day, we're still confident that we're going to have continued growth supportive of our longer-term guide.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Steve. You're really helpful. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGuys.\nThanks so much for taking the questions. One question, one follow-up. First, Steve, you spoke a little bit about emerging markets making up roughly 25% of AFFO per share today. Where do you see that going over time, and how does that inform forward uses of discretionary capital in your M&A strategy? And then just to follow up maybe for Rod, if you can quantify the benefit to property taxes that you saw in the quarter, and just clarify if it's one-time in nature or not. Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower",
    "content2": "Thanks for the question. Let me just clarify. The 25% is pro forma for the India transaction. So it's a little bit higher today. Once we close the India transaction, we'll be at roughly 25%.\nAs we look at some of the macroeconomic conditions, particularly the FX headwinds that we've been seeing, that's given us the choice to start pivoting a little bit more away from the exposure into those emerging market economies, given what we're seeing in the macroeconomic conditions today. What we're doing is pivoting more of our discretionary CapEx to the developed markets. This isn't a new thing. We've been doing that for the last several years, and we haven't done an emerging market transaction in quite a few years now. The bulk of our CapEx has been going toward developed markets. What that will do, if that trend continues, and we expect it to, is it will reduce that emerging market exposure over time.\nWe're not setting a line in the sand today for where we think it should be, but we do think it's appropriate to work that percentage down over time by focusing on our developed markets. Having said that, we will continue to support our tier one M&Os in those markets. We'll make some discretionary CapEx investments where it makes sense and where they meet the return criteria that we've set out for those markets. But in terms of expanding in those markets or looking to double down or anything, that's not something you're likely to see us do, given our desire to reduce the exposure we have to those emerging market economies.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nMatt. Rod here. So on one of the charts, you can see on the Adjusted EBITDA, we're showing roughly a $50 million benefit to outlook on cash gross margins.\nThe way to think about that is much of that is driven, almost all of that is driven by benefits or improvements in that direct expense line. From a high level, think about it as 50/50 mix in terms of what may be run rate and what may be one-time in nature. And then when you think about that, roughly a quarter of the entire piece was a property tax accrual. But there's a lot of other nits, nafs, and things going through that section there. Things like the accelerated e-commerce we just talked about with Rod and the land purchases, as well as just some operational improvements around the way we do R&M and contractor management and other things. So roughly the $49 million of improvement in cash gross margin, think of it 50/50 as one-time versus durable and recurring going forward.\nProperty tax one-time benefit was roughly a quarter of the whole thing.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, you delivered a relatively concise message on the strategy for international markets and emerging markets in particular, and the higher hurdle rates for organic investment. Can we maybe just comment on, broadly speaking, whether you'd be more likely to dispose of some of those non-core emerging market assets if they were able to fetch higher multiples in the market? And then secondly, you also delivered a pretty clear theme around higher returns and portfolio optimization. Can we maybe quantify for us what your consolidated returns and ambitions are, where they are relative to where they stand today?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure.\nI'll hit the first part of that, but Rod can hit the second. We always are looking to actively manage our portfolio. So the management team and the board regularly review our portfolio and look at the assets under our management. And we're always looking to say, \"What's going to create the best long-term shareholder value?\" And so when you think about some of the benefits that American Tower brings to these portfolios, I touched on this a little bit in my preparatory remarks, but I'll reiterate it. We have operational excellence across the globe. And that operational excellence lets us drive best-in-class margins. It lets us optimize the amount of new business we get, so the organic growth is better under American Tower. And so we believe that we create a lot more value for those assets that are under our umbrella than anybody else can.\nNow, where that doesn't hold true, if we think that somebody else can create more value, we would look at divesting it, and that's what we do with India. So absolutely, price is one of the considerations that would factor in when we think about whether a disposition would create more value than to continue to operate it. But at this point, we think the best thing that we can do is keep those assets under our umbrella, continue to operate them in the way that we do, and continue to focus on the gross margin and the growth of the organic revenue there. And if we ever do decide that a disposition is more desirable at that point, that's going to be more valuable because we've created more cash flow on the assets. So right now, that's where our decision point is.\nBut we'll always be nimble, and we'll always look to maximize the long-term value. Now, there are some subscale portfolios and some ancillary businesses that we would think about. If you look at what we've done over the past couple of years, we did divest Mexico Fiber. We did divest Poland, one because it was subscale, the other because we thought somebody else could maximize that business better. And so when you look at some of those portfolios and our overall portfolio, that's the type of thing that we think about. But there's no process we've announced today and nothing I would point to of any scale that we would think would make sense in the short term.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nJim. Rod here. I'll just hit on your return on invested capital question.\nSo one thing I would point out right at the start here is we do give in the disclosures the NOI yield in US dollar terms for vintage. So I think you've probably seen that, but dig into that. There's a lot of interesting information in there. One thing I would point out is that the NOI yields in US dollar terms typically are higher than the US when you're looking at these emerging markets. So for built-to-suits and other investments, that's been the case. And they need to be because we, as Steve talked about, have risk-adjusted return requirements, of course, not just per region, but by country and even deal specific. So we do require an additional spread, a risk-adjusted spread, sometimes even over and above the detailed country-level cost of capital that we calculate.\nWe'll require a spread over that that could be meaningful to compensate for other things that we see either in the market or in the portfolio. So that certainly is key. But when you look at that analysis, you'll see that the vintage analysis shows that the NOI yields over time go up. Certainly, when you think about the emerging markets, we're looking at low teens here and heading upwards. We would expect them all to be in the upper teens and certainly in places like Africa, above 20% over time would certainly be where we would target that. So broadly speaking, you've heard us say it before, but when you think about Africa, we're looking for high teens, north of 20% returns. And then depending on the country, it can even be higher at the high end of that and even higher. Today, we're below that.\nBut if you look at our return on invested capital across the region, as reported, we're in the mid-teens for return on invested capital. But these are long-term assets. So our focus on driving organic growth, margin expansion, really driving SG&A costs being super efficient when it comes to the way we operate the markets, including Africa, but LatAm and even India while we have it. And combining that, coupling that with very disciplined CapEx programs, maybe even lower CapEx programs, are all meant to drive return on invested capital up for us so that we can reach our hurdle rate and get beyond it. And again, these are long-term assets. And LatAm is in maybe a little better of a position, but similar. They're in the low teens from a return on invested capital.\nThe requirements there are going to be more in the mid-teens, not necessarily north of 20%. So you may recall we've done a fair amount of building and acquiring there over the last several years. So again, the focus on operational execution and excellence in these markets, we really talk about that. We plan that, and we drive that in the business to help accelerate these returns on invested capital over the long term. But these are long-term assets, and we're very bullish on the underlying fundamentals of the business, not just in the US, Europe, and of course, but the fundamentals underpinning the operating results across LatAm and Africa are very good. And in Europe, we're actually seeing an acceleration in new business contributions in organic tenant billings, 24 over 23. So that is certainly a very positive sign. Hopefully, that addresses the question, Jim.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Thank you.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the data center segment with CoreSite. You mentioned you had your second highest bookings quarter this quarter. So could you talk about what the demand backdrop looks like there? Do you see more larger footprint opportunities tied to either cloud or AI, or is your performance more related to traditional enterprise workloads?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. I'll address demand, and then I'll address who we're leasing to as separate issues. We're seeing broad-based demand from a lot of different sectors. Part of that, there's a scarcity of supply in some of the markets that we're in.\nOur key customer base that's driving long-term demand in CoreSite continues to be enterprises that are deploying hybrid cloud deployments, hybrid cloud technology. We see a very long tail of that business. It's probably helpful for me to talk a little bit about how we curate our customer mix. CoreSite doesn't just lease to just anybody who wants to lease space in their facilities, particularly when we're looking at our scale and hyperscale space that's available. We want to lease to customers that help build the ecosystem. That's why we are pretty selective in terms of who we lease to. That hybrid cloud deployment is the perfect type of customer to help build that ecosystem.\nWe are seeing demand from AI, and the inferencing layer of AI is perfectly suited for a highly interconnected ecosystem like CoreSite because it helps distribute the content that the AI is generating. And so we do see some demand there. We're being selective in terms of who we're willing to lease to in that. We do recognize that not all customers are built the same in that space, and we want to make sure that we're partnering with people who have good long-term business plans there. But what's driving the overall demand is just a general scarcity of supply there. But we're continuing to lease to that core customer base, expanding our enterprise reach for hybrid cloud deployments, a little bit of AI, and then continuing to serve a lot of the customers that we already have there as they expand their needs.\nThose are the primary drivers from who we're leasing to.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. Just one follow-up for Rod. You touched on the deleveraging path and the potential for buyback. So as we're looking at 25, any early reads on what key variables you may look at when making that decision, whether it's AFFO yields versus implied cost of capital or any other variables to keep in mind and when the buyback conversation may become a little more tangible?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. It's a good question, Eric. I would say, first off, you saw in the numbers, we're at about 4.8 times levered. Our stated range is three to five times, so we're below that. We're also at about five times at the end of Q1. Leverage for Q1 and Q2 were materially supported or helped by some one-time non-recurring benefits.\nWith that said, and Steve alluded to this earlier, we do expect leverage to tick back up to 5.0 or 5.1 during Q3 and Q4. We'll see where that goes. But we're very confident that we are on the right path, driving towards getting to that 5.0, and we will get there, most likely the second half of this year, if not the very beginning of next year. So with that, we do feel as though we'll be in a position to have financial flexibility and manage the business without a hyper-focus on the delevering. And with that said, we'll be very disciplined. We'll be looking at all of our capital allocation options, including our CapEx programs, not in general, but specifically country-by-country, deal-by-deal, asset-by-asset.\nThere's some compelling things that we can invest our capital in, as Steve outlined in his strategic preparatory remarks and in some of the Q&A. So the CapEx programs are still very much supportive of long-term total shareholder return, so that's an opportunity. When it comes to buybacks, the buybacks, it has to create more shareholder value over the long term than deploying it towards CapEx, an M&A program, or delevering. There are simple ways to look at it in terms of just you buy back a share of stock as the yield above or below the cost of debt. We'll certainly be looking at that. But longer-term growth rates are really important too on our own business as well as where we invest. So we'll be looking at the returns beyond day one as well.\nBut rest assured, we will be doing a lot of work, being very opportunistic and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation across the board. And buying back shares will be one of the options that we have in our toolkit that we'll be continuing to evaluate.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, going back to CoreSite, yeah, I think you're planning your first aggregation edge data center in Raleigh. And I also saw a footnote that you're launching a JV with Stonepeak in Denver. So can you talk about what you're hoping to achieve with those projects, the rationale for the deal structure in Denver, and whether we should expect more projects like these in the coming years?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure.\nWell, those are two very different projects. So I'll start with the Raleigh. So the Raleigh data center is really being done by our US Tower division working with CoreSite. And that is our continued evolution as we work with various partners on the edge. We needed a little bit more of a sandbox for them to play in. And Raleigh was a good market. It has low power costs. There's a lot of enterprise there that are working on edge applications. And so we think it's a good place for us to start there. And we are seeing demand in that market that we think we can serve there. That one's expandable. It's on a tower site, so we were able to get easy access to land. There's power. There's fiber. It was just a great location for us.\nAnd so we'll see how that plays out over time. Again, that's part of our experimentation on the edge, and we do have some clear visibility into monetizing that as well. So that's a benefit of having a sandbox that makes money. The second one, DE3. So this is a little bit different. This is our first purpose-built data center in Denver. And while we do have a small presence in Denver, it's not really a campus effect yet. And what we've said over time is we're open to structures where we're a minority partner, where it gives us the ability to build a campus over time. So for that particular facility, we're taking advantage of the opportunity that we have to meet the demand for a strategic customer to support the ecosystem in Denver.\nWe're utilizing our partnership and the capital flexibility that we have with that partnership to not redirect any of our current cash flow, our current CapEx program to that. Our partner is happy to fund that development. The reason we're doing that is to really start building that campus in Denver and to do it in a capital-efficient way for us. So we think that's the right structure for that facility. That parcel is large enough to build other buildings. We have retained ownership of those other buildings in CoreSite. If we build future pieces of the campus, that would likely be done in CoreSite. We do have the ability to buy back the one that's being built there if we decide that that's the right thing to do as we build that ecosystem over time.\nThat structure today, it's very similar to what you've seen other data centers do with private capital partners. CoreSite's going to own 15%. Stonepeak will own 85% as we develop that first facility there in Denver.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. That's great. Thanks for those details, Steve. Second, turning back to emerging markets towers. In your prepared remarks, you said that scale is the most critical driver of value creation overseas. How do you define and measure scale? Is it just a given number of towers? Is it a share of towers? Is it exposure to top carriers? When do you look at scale by region versus country? Just interested in naming each other on that front so we can better understand what you're looking for.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure.\nLook, at a high level, you want to be the number one or number two independent tower company in a market if you can. That's your ideal situation to be in. At a broad level, scale means being strategically relevant to your customers. So you can have some localized scale without having national scale as long as you're relevant enough to have some leverage in the negotiations with the customer there. And so that's really how we think about scale. We have some markets where we're subscale, but we're able to leverage regional scale in those by using operating leverage. And what I mean by that is we can serve some of those underscale markets with the human capital we have in other parts of those markets. So we might operate a small country from a larger country that's nearby.\nAnd that's how we're getting some operational scale that helps us get even better returns in there than you really would naturally get in a subscale market. But at the end of the day, we want to be the number one or two in the market in terms of independence. Captives are a little bit different because they have different dynamics with it. But that's how we think about it overall. And we do have, if you look at Latin America, about 97% of our sites are in markets where we're the leader. In Africa, it's well over half of the sites that we're the market leader in. A little bit lower in Europe today. But overall, we feel like we have adequate scale in all those markets to be strategically relevant to the customers and to get the cost synergy that you get.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nManaging Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. That's great. Thanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your final question today comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nManaging Director and Communications and Media Infrastructure Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. Comprehensive MLAs have helped provide visibility for domestic growth. Can you talk about if you're also seeing opportunities to implement the same strategy internationally, and could that change the growth trajectory? Also wanted to follow up on AFFO growth. With solid revenue growth and good cost control, if you just put effects and fluctuations in rates aside, do you think that we're back on a trend for high single-digit AFFO growth for the next few years? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. I'll take the part about the MLAs, and Rod can touch on the growth. The confidence of MLAs that we have in the US are pretty much uniquely in the US right now.\nWe've talked to partners internationally about those contract structures, and there's some interest in learning more about them. But because they haven't been used in those markets before, there's some understandable concern on the counterparty side about being the first one to take the leap into that. So we've encouraged them to talk to our US customers to understand the benefits of that. So I'm hopeful that we can export those because, again, those create value for both parties. It gives us predictability on the revenue side. It gives the customers predictability on their cost side. It vastly simplifies the deployment of networks by the customers. So I'm hopeful that our international customers will embrace that. And we'll continue talking with them about it until they do. But none to announce right now, Batya.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nManaging Director and Communications and Media Infrastructure Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nBatya. Batya. Rod here. I'll take the AFFO piece.\nSo I'll start off by saying we believe in the fundamentals of the portfolio that we've built around the globe. Certainly, when you think about our ability to drive AFFO per share growth, it really starts with revenue growth. So I could give you a very short answer to your question. I'll give you the medium answer here. So the way we think about the bits and pieces that support and drive AFFO per share growth, certainly in the US, we're continuing to see demand and activity levels that are in line with our previous long-term guide on OTBG, organic tenant billings growth, in and around that 5%. You've heard us say it. We continue to see demand for our emerging markets. And in Europe, we're seeing escalating new business growth, which is really good.\nThat's all very supportive over the long term for the international towers that we have to deliver higher organic tenant billings growth than the US does by maybe a couple hundred basis points. That is certainly front and center. CoreSite, as you heard from Steve and you see in our numbers and you have for several quarters, is outperforming our expectations and very accretive to overall growth rates. That's been really nice to see. We continue to build sites very opportunistically and disciplined. Maybe not as many as we used to, but we build sites that add to that growth rate and revenue. So you put all that together, and you're in the upper single digits in terms of revenue growth, call it 6% or 7%, somewhere in that range.\nAnd then we're focused on margin expansion, controlling the direct cost, driving margins up. That means you get into that range around the gross margin point. SG&A, this year alone, SG&A is going down $30 million year-over-year at constant last year as well. So SG&A cost control is also supportive and accretive to those growth rates. So when you think about all the things that we've done and everything that we see, the fundamentals in this business for our towers globally is really strong and could potentially deliver upper single-digit AFFO growth on the towers around the globe. Now, the things that you do need to watch, we certainly watch and pay a lot of attention to. Some of these are not under our control, of course. Interest rates could go up or down. That could be positive or negative from time to time. FX, same thing.\nCould go up, could go down, could be positive, could be negative. And then in particular, very specifically, we have the ATC India sale, which we are very confident will close out during the second half of this year, just like we previously guided. That will be slightly diluted, maybe about $0.08 to 0.09 on a per quarter basis. So if we close it early in October, you might see $0.08 or 0.09 dilution from that. And then you'll see the follow-on tail of that into next year. But absent interest rates, or assuming interest rates are flat, FX is flat, and eliminating the ATC India, we have a portfolio of assets here that are performing very well operationally with the fundamentals that could deliver upper single-digit AFFO per share growth.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nManaging Director and Communications and Media Infrastructure Analyst, UBS\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and FP&A, American Tower\n\nAll right.Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business, and the expected impact of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time to time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in the results we reported this morning, mobile network upgrades and digital transformation trends are driving compelling demand across our tower and data center platforms. 5G rollouts are contributing to an acceleration in our US application pipeline and another sequential step-up in colocation and amendment growth in Europe. Solid demand in Africa continued to drive elevated new business growth, and retail demand resulted in another quarter of strong sales performance at CoreSite, which you'll hear more about later on.\nBefore handing the call over to Rod, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the key factors that have driven performance in our US and Canada tower business and underpin the evaluation and execution of our global expansion strategy. In particular, we believe that our focus on asset quality, operational excellence, and contract structures, all through the prism of long-term value creation, have been the most critical factors in determining our ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption and our ability to drive leading performance on our assets over multiple network investment cycles.\nOver the last 25 years, we've developed a scaled nationwide portfolio of approximately 43,000 sites across the US and Canada. This portfolio has been methodically constructed primarily through the acquisition of high-quality, carrier-designed and constructed tower portfolios on which nationwide networks have been built and expanded upon through each successive G, and have further benefited from the transition to neutral host operation.\nWe've complemented the acquisition of these target assets with select high-quality independent tower provider portfolios, smaller tuck-in portfolios, and build-to-suit sites, which taken together represent meaningful scale. Our ability to be highly selective in the assets that we've aggressively pursued for acquisition and development, the assets we've chosen not to pursue, and the standards we've used to underwrite our growth are the result of robust internal analysis and due diligence capabilities that rely on data insights that we've accumulated through our history as a tower operator.\nThese insights have reinforced our understanding of how asset location, competition considerations, and structural dynamics come together to create the potential for differentiated value creation. For example, our focus on high-quality assets in premier locations has resulted in a portfolio that's geographically skewed towards suburban and rural environments, and transport corridors where the vast majority of Americans live and travel, as well as towers that are structurally designed for co-tenancy, which we believe has enabled us to generate leading new business growth on our assets.\nSimilarly, by focusing on assets with significant structural capacity, we believe we can reduce overall operating and redevelopment costs, allowing for profit and return maximization at the asset level and industry-best speed to market for carrier deployments in our towers. We've seen these factors come together to result in significant value creation on our assets. Notably, CAC operating profit margins for our US and Canada property segment have expanded by over 440 basis points since 2016, the year following our Verizon transaction in the US.\nAs we continue to focus on driving more new business and efficiency at the asset level, we see a path to further increasing the profitability of our US and Canada business going forward. Turning to our operating model, through our focus on efficiency and delivering exceptional value for customers, we've invested in technology and the buildup of capabilities that we believe enhance the service we provide our customers and the value of our product offering.\nFor example, through our application and services automation programs, we've continuously reduced cycle times, further supporting critical speed-to-market advantages for our customers, which translates into accelerated revenue realization for our business. Elsewhere in our services segment, we've combined investments in data quality and governance with the development of internal data platforms to improve our overall service offerings and asset integrity.\nOver time, customer feedback shows that these investments have resulted in a consistent upward trajectory in customer satisfaction achieved by providing a differentiated customer experience with high asset integrity. In our land management operations, we've also taken an approach that's focused on our customers' needs and expanding the profitability of our sites. Through our Tower Asset Protection Program, we perform thousands of transactions a year that improve the ground rights and ease site access conditions, a critical factor for our customers.\nOver the last decade, we've deployed significant capital at attractive rates of return and omitted thousands of contracts to protect our assets and mitigate growth in land rent, supporting margin performance. Finally, as we've said publicly many times, contract terms and structure are critical to realizing the full value of the assets we own and manage, and our approach has been centered around creating long-term value for American Tower and our carrier customers, even when it can potentially come at the expense of short-term wins.\nPerhaps the most important capability we've built internally over the last two decades is knowing our assets and understanding their value. As a result, we've been able to achieve outstanding growth and create significant shareholder value under traditional MLA agreements while also developing innovative structures such as the comprehensive MLA. Under these agreements, we're able to secure guaranteed growth over a multi-year period in a way that maximizes the value of our assets while providing a degree of insulation from quarter-to-quarter ebbs and flows in wireless network spending.\nCritically, we've seen that these contracts represent a compelling value proposition for our carrier customers by lowering their total cost of ownership when compared to self-perform. By providing a framework to leverage our skill for your networks that translates to budgetary operational visibility, and by creating administrative efficiencies that yield lower transaction costs on cell site deployments. Taking all this together, we've seen this focus on the right assets, high-quality contracts, and operational excellence facilitate increasing monetization and growth in mobile data consumption and corresponding carrier CapEx increases over time.\nOver the course of the 4G investment cycle between 2010 and 2018, average mobile data consumption for a smartphone increased from less than 100 MB per month to 7 GB per month. Over that period, carriers were deploying approximately $29 billion annually on average, up from approximately $23 billion during 3G. As we've moved into the 5G investment cycle from early 2019 to today, we've once again seen mobile data consumption for smartphones grow to almost 30 GB per month in 2024.\nWe've seen early 5G subscribers consuming roughly 2x the mobile data compared to the average 4G subscriber, and we've seen average annual carrier CapEx step up to approximately $36 billion a year. This CapEx investment translated to the approximately $230 million in year-over-year colocation amendment growth we delivered last year, much of which was attributed to 5G activity, as well as an expectation for growth on a per-site basis in 2024 that significantly exceeds the average seen during the 4G deployment cycle.\nThat brings us to today, where we continue to see all of our key customers actively working on network upgrades and rollouts, and the 5G cycle playing out in line with the broader expectations underwritten in our long-term guidance. On our last call, we indicated that we expected a year-over-year increase in contributions from our services segment, due in part to early indications of an uptick in our application pipeline, as well as conversations that our teams were having with our customers on the ground. The activity we saw in Q1 reinforces that expectation.\nSpecifically, contributions in our services segment for the quarter came in ahead of our internal expectations, and on the application side, Q1 volume was over 70% higher than what we saw in Q4 of last year. In fact, March represented the highest volume level over the trailing 12 months and was supported by broad-based step-ups across our major US customers.\nNow, while there's always some level of risk associated with our expectations in the services segment, I'm pleased to say that what we've seen thus far supports the 2024 guidance we provided in February, including approximately $195 million in expected services revenue contributions, approximately 4.7% organic tenant billings growth, and $180 to 190 million in year-over-year colocation and amendment growth, one of our strongest years to date.\nSo, as we move forward, we believe our US tower portfolio is uniquely positioned to continue driving compelling growth as 5G, expected increases in mobile data consumption, and associated carrier investments drive increasing demand for our assets over time.\nImportantly, by leveraging that same expertise to develop our leading global portfolio, we're well-positioned to monetize similar trends across our global footprint while delivering a differentiated experience and value proposition to our customers. Further, we believe the factors I've taken you through today, as well as the global focus on increasing efficiency in our cost structure, provide a path to continue converting top-line growth at a rate that expands already attractive cash operating profit margins and creates incremental shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q1 performance and our updated outlook. Rod?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We are off to a solid start to 2024, with Q1 performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. These results, together with the positive trends highlighted by Steve, the various initiatives we have in place to drive profitability and margin expansion, and our optionality and discipline in selectively deploying capital towards projects yielding the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, give us confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth, quality of earnings, and shareholder returns for 2024 and beyond.\nBefore I dive into the results and our revised 2024 outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, the strong recurring fundamentals that underpin our business are again highlighted in our Q1 performance, with consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.4% and another exceptional leasing quarter at CoreSite, including its highest quarter of retail new business signs since Q4 of 2020. Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate cost discipline, resulting in strong year-over-year cash-adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I will touch on in a moment.\nNext, in India, the collections trends we saw in Q4 of 2023 continued into Q1, allowing us to reverse approximately $29 million of previously reserved revenue. Separately, while we continue to anticipate a second half 2024 closing on our sale of ATC India to Brookfield, we have already made progress in accelerating certain payments included in the potential $2.5 billion total proceeds associated with the transaction, including the repatriation of approximately $100 million net of withholding tax back to the US earlier this month.\nAdditionally, we are making progress towards monetizing our optionally convertible debentures issued by VIL ahead of the anticipated closing of our India transaction, executing the intended purpose of the debentures in serving as a liquid asset to backstop outstanding receivable balances. We expect to use the anticipated proceeds from the India sale to pay down existing indebtedness.\nWe will continue to keep our shareholders informed as incremental progress is made towards the closing of our transaction. Finally, we successfully accessed the debt capital markets last month, issuing $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 5.3%, with proceeds used to pay down floating rate debt. Turning to first quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide six, consolidated property revenue growth was 3.3%, or over 4.5% excluding non-cash straight-line revenue, while absorbing roughly 100 basis points of FX headwinds.\nUS and Canada property revenue growth was approximately 1.8%, or over 4% excluding straight-line, which includes over 1% impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 3.7%, or roughly 6% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes a benefit associated with the improved collections in India, partially offset by the timing of the sale of our Mexico fiber business at the end of Q1 in 2023, and a reduction in Latin America termination fees as compared to the prior year.\nFinally, revenue in our data center business increased by 10.6%, continuing the outperformance versus our initial underwriting plan as strong demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues and the backlog of record new business signed over the last two years begins to commence in a meaningful way. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, supported by strong demand across our global footprint. In our US and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.6% and over 5.5% absent Sprint-related churn.\nAs expected, growth in the quarter was slightly below our full-year guidance of 4.7%. As we lap modestly elevated churn that commenced in Q2 of 2023, we would expect Q2 and Q3 growth rates to each accelerate to roughly 5% before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation. Our international segment drove 6.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting an expected step down from the Q4 2023 rate of 7.7%, as we see moderation in CPI-linked escalators.\nMeanwhile, contributions from colocation and amendments remain strong, with another sequential acceleration in Europe and a continuation of elevated contribution rates of around 8% in Africa. Turning to slide seven, adjusted EBITDA grew 5.2%, or nearly 8% excluding the impacts of non-cash straight-line, while absorbing 90 basis points in FX headwinds.\nCash adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 240 basis points year-over-year to 64.9%, taking certain expense timing and any reserve benefits, and further supported by our ongoing cost management focus. In fact, cash SG&A excluding bad debt declined approximately 5% year-over-year in Q1 and was down roughly 7% off our Q1 2022 levels. Additionally, gross margin from our US services business came in just over $16 million, a decline of roughly 50% year-over-year, though representing an acceleration of nearly 70% off our Q4 2023 levels.\nThis performance, together with the broad-based application pipeline buildup discussed by Steve in his prepared remarks, gives us confidence in our expectation for accelerating activity continuing through the duration of the year and is supportive of our full-year US services outlook. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 10% and 9.8% respectively, supported by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO.\nNow, shifting to our revised full-year outlook, as I mentioned, we are pleased with the results to date and the sustainable demand trends underpinning our performance. However, given the close proximity to our previously released guidance, we have kept core full-year assumptions largely unchanged. With that in mind, our revised outlook includes several notable updates.\nFirst, we have taken the strong collections activity in India through the first quarter, which, as I mentioned earlier, resulted in approximately $29 million in revenue reserve reversals compared to approximately $16 million in revenue reserves assumed for Q1 in our prior outlook, resulting in a net benefit to plan of $45 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and attributable AFFO.\nReserve assumptions for April through December remain unchanged, resulting in a net reserve for the year of $20 million compared to the prior outlook assumption of $65 million. Next, we have revised our FX assumptions for the year, resulting in a modest headwind compared to our prior outlook. Finally, while our net interest assumptions remain relatively unchanged, we have increased our interest expense due to elevated rates, which was partially offset by modest interest expense reductions through a reduced debt balance attributed to the accelerated India proceeds I mentioned earlier, and further offset by higher interest income.\nWith that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to slide eight, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $30 million compared to prior outlook, driven by $45 million of upside related to the positive collections in India during the first quarter, partially offset by $15 million associated with negative FX impacts. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across all regions, including approximately 4.7% in the US and Canada, 11% to 12 in Africa, 5% to 6 in Europe, and 2% in both LATAM and APAC, collectively driving approximately 5% for international and 5% on a consolidated basis.\nWe will continue to assess our first quarter momentum as we work through the year. Turning to slide nine, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $40 million as compared to prior outlook, driven by the flow-through of the revised revenue reserve assumptions in India, partially offset by $5 million of FX headwinds. Moving to slide 10, we are similarly raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint, and approximately $0.09 on a per-share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.42, supported by the revised India reserve assumption benefits, partially offset by FX.\nAs I mentioned, although we are raising expectations for interest expense, it is offset on a net basis by a similar increase in interest income. Turning to slide 11, we are reiterating our capital allocation plans for 2024, which is focused on selectively funding projects we expect to drive the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, sustained growth, and quality of earnings, executing on an accelerated pathway to balance sheet strength and financial flexibility, and delivering an attractive total shareholder return profile.\nAs discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call, this includes maintaining a relatively flat annual common dividend declaration of $6.48 per share, or approximately $3 billion in 2024, with an expectation to resume growth again in 2025, all subject to board approval. Moving to the right side of the slide, our disciplined approach to capital allocation, together with recurring top-line growth and its high conversion to profitability through cost management, all support the progress we've made to achieving our goal of 5x net leverage by the end of the year.\nWhile our Q1 net leverage already stands at 5x, it is important to note that the metric for this quarter benefits from the India reserve reversals previously mentioned and we'd expect to be above 5x in Q2. These efforts, combined with our successful capital markets execution year to date, have further reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet as a strategic asset, which will remain a key focus moving forward. Turning to slide 12, and in summary, we are off to a great start to 2024.\nOur visibility into a solid foundation of recurring contracted growth across our global business, combined with an accelerating pipeline supporting our expectations for future activity, a keen focus on cost discipline and margin expansion, and a continued demonstration of strategically deploying capital while enhancing balance sheet strength, gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth over the long-term for our shareholders while being a best-in-class operator for our stakeholders globally. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. In one moment, please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Just two, if I could. First, on the US, maybe you can get a little bit more color on the acceleration and activity you saw in the quarter and maybe what that implies for services and new leasing expectations going forward. I'm more curious whether this was broad-based across the big three and maybe even DISH or more limited in nature.\nAnd then secondly, on data centers, I think you talked about your highest quarter of signed retail leasing since Q4 2020. Any color you can share in terms of what's driving the uptick in new business? It seems to imply there isn't much in the way of macro headwinds or caution that some of your peers have talked about. But again, just curious if there are any signs of macro caution there. Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. In the US, again, we're seeing an acceleration in Q1 relative to Q4. And our application pipeline coming in Q1 was about 70% higher than Q4. And our services gross margin came in at about 16 million in the quarter, which was higher than we'd expected. So what we're seeing is an acceleration activity that really underpins the guidance we gave last quarter. And just to kind of reiterate what that is, on our services, we're expecting our services about $195 million in revenue, about $100 million in gross margin.\nLook, while that for services is inherently hard to predict sometimes, the activity we're seeing in Q1, along with the conversations we're having with kind of the boots-on-the-ground teams from our customers, that gives us confidence that we're going to hit that services guide for the year. So we'll continue to watch it and see how that cadence goes throughout the rest of the year. But everything we're seeing in Q1 gives us some optimism there. Now, when it comes to our property revenue growth from that, again, I'll remind you that a lot of our revenue assumptions are underpinned by our comprehensive MLAs.\nSo at this point, the acceleration that we're seeing in growth doesn't change our guidance in terms of what we're expecting to see in the US. Again, I'll reiterate that. We're expecting to see organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% in the US. That will be a little bit different quarter by quarter. In Q1, it was 4.6%. We'll expect that to go up a little bit in the middle of the year. Then the final tranche of Sprint churn that hits in October will weigh that down a bit in Q4. But overall, we're encouraged by that. In terms of what we're seeing, it is fairly broad-based.\nI don't want to get into individual customer activity levels, but we are seeing some broad-based activity pickup in the US with all of our major customers. Again, we're encouraged that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. When it comes to CoreSite, we have two years of kind of record sales, and we have a healthy pipeline this year. We've got a tough comp compared to last year, so I don't know that we'll achieve another record year of sales, but we're hoping. We did have a very strong quarter on retail this year, and that was really exciting to see. In terms of the headwinds for that business, we're very optimistic about what we're seeing.\nAgain, what's underpinning the growth in CoreSite right now, the bulk of that growth is being driven by enterprises that are going to hybrid cloud IT infrastructure. There's a long tail of that that we see out there. There's still a lot of companies that have their own data centers, and there are a lot of companies that went cloud-native or that had moved everything to the cloud, and they're looking for a different cost structure, and they're going to this hybrid environment. That's still the biggest driver we have. We see a very, very long tail of that activity out there. We are seeing an uptick in activity from AI.\nIn particular, the inferencing portion of AI models is kind of perfectly suited for CoreSite. You're going to have these large learning models that are done in the big hyperscale data centers. But when you start interfacing with the users to provide that data to them and also get the inputs from them, you need a distribution channel. CoreSite is perfectly suited to provide that type of distribution. We are seeing some activity there. In terms of kind of industry headwinds, we're not seeing a falloff in our funnel today. We're watching it just like everyone else is.\nSome of the things that people have highlighted, some of the demand, I mean, supply issues are things that actually drive pricing up. So where we have markets that are constrained in supply, that's actually driving pricing up. We've got more megawatts under construction today than we ever had before at CoreSite. So we're planning for that demand cycle to continue. But I'll just reiterate that a large portion of that's pre-leased more than we ever have before. In fact, our pre-leasing percentage right now of the stuff that we have under construction is about 35%.\nAnd that's down a tick from last quarter because we've placed some things in service. But we're still seeing healthy demand for pre-leasing, and we'll continue to explore that as well. We're still seeing growth in interconnect. And I know that there's been some discussion out there about grooming of cross-connects. That's something that we constantly see with customers as they're trying to optimize their cost structure. But even with a little bit of grooming going on, we're still seeing healthy growth there. So again, I think we're very optimistic about the demand for CoreSite, the pipeline that we're seeing.\nHoping for another record year of sales, but that's a tough comp. So I'm sure my sales team is cringing hearing me say that. But we feel good about it. And we're not seeing headwinds weigh on it today. But again, we're watching the market just like everybody else is, and we'll be appropriately cautious if we see that demand slowing down. But that's not what we're seeing from our sales teams today.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Matt, this is Rod. If I could just add briefly here one or two comments. So with CoreSite, as Steve said, we've had record levels of new business in the past. What that is leading to is higher revenue growth now as we're delivering that new business that we signed up over the last couple of years. So you saw in the quarter, we had north of 10% revenue growth rate. As I said in my prepared remarks, that is the result of delivering on that new business, those record levels of new business we signed up over the last couple of years. The last couple of years of new business has also led to a high level of backlog.\nSo we're up close to $60 million in terms of backlog, which are signed deals that we haven't commenced into revenue yet. That's up from a run rate of closer to $40 or $45 million in the last couple of years. So the new business we sign up, it translates into backlog, and then it translates into revenue and revenue growth. So with the activity level we've seen in the last couple of years, the high backlog we have today, that positions CoreSite very well to have high levels of growth over the next couple of years.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you both for all that color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks and good morning. Just following up on your comments regarding the pickup in domestic activity in the first quarter, do you see this as a rising tide for the tower category, or do you see American Tower taking share from your competitors? And then secondly, you referenced, I think in one of the slides and some of your comments, that the activity is supporting your long-term guide for the domestic business. If you can recap for us where you see the longer-term average annual organic tenant billings growth and how these changes in activity levels may influence those outcomes. Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. So what we're seeing in the US, it's clearly one quarter results. And again, the conversations that we're having give us the optimism that our guide for the year is kind of spot on in terms of the customers starting to ramp up. I don't have a lot of visibility into what my competitors are seeing, so I don't think I can give an opinion on whether what we're seeing is materially different than what they're seeing. But when I reflect on what the customers need to do to complete their mid-band 5G rollouts and when I think about what their long-term goals are on their network, there's a lot of work yet to be done.\nSo what I think that we're seeing play out is the same cycle we saw in 4G, the same cycle we saw in 3G, where there's an initial push, then there's a little bit of a slowdown while they're optimizing their network, and then there's another push. And I think that we're starting to see that. Now, where I do think we've really differentiated ourselves is that our MLAs do provide a little bit of an easy button for our customers. And we're able to give them great speed to market, great cost predictability. And I think that that does give us greater market share over time.\nBack to kind of our longer-term guide for the US, just to remind everyone, we said that we expect at least 5% organic tenant billings growth on average for the period between 2023 and 2027. That would be 6% excluding the Sprint churn that we have. In 2023, that OTBG number was 5.3, and we're projecting 4.7% this year. That's all while we're absorbing greater than 100 basis points of Sprint churn a year in each of those years.\nSo we see the activity levels very supportive of that long-term guide. Again, we feel good about the cycle of 5G. We feel good about the carrier activity that we're seeing and about the way 5G is performing in terms of giving them megabytes of data or gigabytes of data a lot cheaper than they could produce it any other way.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks. And just one other quick one. Any shift in the mix between amendments and densification within the domestic activity?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nA little bit. Again, I think when you think about these cycles that the carriers build in, the first push that you see is always a coverage network, and that implies overlays on existing sites. And then when they slow down and start optimizing, part of that optimization is infill to give better quality of service where they might have some coverage gaps or might not be getting the optimal service. And that always implies more colocations. So we are seeing some demand for that as well. Again, we see some kind of broad-based activity. So we're seeing both, and we're seeing that across the carriers.\nAnd again, I would just remind folks that we do have comprehensive MLAs in place with some of our customers that smooth out some of those cycles of the ups and downs of the activity levels. We did disclose in Q1 that one of our major customers rolled off of their comprehensive MLA. And so for that customer, when you come off the comprehensive portion and go to more of the kind of pay-by-the-drink, there is more seasonality in terms of the commencements of those leases as they sign them. And so from that perspective, activity levels will drive that portion of our business more than they do for the ones that are on the comprehensive MLAs.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks for all those details. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning. Steve, thanks for the comments on the portfolio review. Maybe you could just review the M&A market more broadly. Are there things that you might be looking at doing, either buying or selling, beyond the India situation and how you think about that? And then any other things that come out of any sort of portfolio assessment. And then any updates on the deal timing in India? I think we talked last quarter perhaps about sort of 1 October as being kind of a placeholder. But any updates on regulatory processes in India at this point? Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. Sure. I'll start with the India. No updates at this point. It's very hard to predict when that approval will come through. So we're still expecting the second half of the year. But we'll let you know as soon as we know what's happening on that. In terms of broader M&A, our teams look at everything that's kind of out there for sale, and that's just part of our standard practice. There's nothing that we're seeing that's compelling that would take us off of our capital allocation priorities that we laid out at the beginning of the year. That is our first priority of any of our capital allocations paying our dividend.\nBut then we're really focused on deleveraging after that, making sure we get down to our 5x that leverage. And so when we're looking at the M&A that's out there, there's nothing that we're seeing today that is strategically important or at the right price that would make us change our mind on that at this point. When it comes to our own portfolio, and I just want to be clear about this, we're not doing a strategic review specifically of anything, meaning there's nothing that we're intending to sell out there today. Now, having said that, we do have some businesses that may not be as strategic for us, or they may not be at scale.\nAnd if the right buyer with the right price came along, we would consider something there. But as we look at our portfolio kind of across the globe, our goal is to figure out if there are businesses that are not meeting our original underwriting criteria. The first thing is, what can we do to fix those? How do we drive greater sales? How do we get more efficiency in the market to drive margins up? And we'll try that first.\nIf we decide to exit another market, it would have to be because we're getting the right price and that we think it's more accretive to our shareholders than holding it. So at this point, there's nothing to point to in our portfolio that we're actively looking to dispose of. But again, there are some non-strategic businesses for us out there that we would consider if the right buyer and the right price came along.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Simon.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. That's helpful.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nSimon, I'm going to add a couple of comments on India just to give everyone listening a couple of the numbers and a reminder. So as Steve said, the timing is still second half this year. Everything is going well, certainly within our expectation. I just want to remind everyone that we announced when we signed the deal with Brookfield to sell 100% of India that it would have total proceeds that could be up to $2.5 billion. That comes in a couple of different forms. It'll be $2 billion in terms of the, let's call it the purchase price, which includes the intercompany debt that we have in there as well as a term loan that we have in India.\nThe intercompany debt is a little less than $0.5 billion, and then the term loan is about $120 million. It also includes some working capital, some receivables, and the OCD that I'm sure you're familiar with that we put in place with VIL. So the OCD was about $200 million. The other India receivables was a little less than about $200 million. And then there's also a ticking fee component that we get that is based on the mechanics between signing and closing. You put all those things together. It comes up to about $2.5 billion. We are in the process of realizing and taking some of these proceeds out of India.\nSo you did see, and you'll see in the details, we removed about $100 million from India and took it back to the US. That's based on some of the positive collections trends that we've seen in India. Those receivables belong to us and is part of the $2.5 billion. We also converted 90% of the $200 million OCD, and then we subsequently liquidated that right kind of during and after the successful FPO that VIL had done, which we were happy to see. So the 90% of the $200 million that we converted, we sold it into the market, and we realized a little over $200 million on that. So that's worked out really well.\nAnd again, I'll just highlight that it's achieving our original purpose, which is giving us multiple avenues to liquidate that receivable balance, increasing the probability of actually realizing cash. And it worked well. So we have over $200 million. You will see us remove that from India and bring it back to the US as well. And on closing, you'll see the $2 billion plus any kind of ticking fee probably be paired up around closing, just to give everyone the mechanics of those and what to expect in terms of the proceeds on closing.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great. Thanks for that. And any update on dividend policy beyond this year?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. What we've said is we plan to resume growth in 2025, subject to board approval. We'll give specifics on our Q4 call in February 2025, as we always do in terms of what that's going to look like. Over the long-term, what you can think about is that our dividend per share and AFFO per share growth will be similar over the longer term. So there may be some short-term changes in that.\nFor example, with our India divestiture, there will be some dilution in AFFO per share. So there might be a dislocation there from the AFFO per share growth and what we will see in taxable income. Over the long-term, you can think about those being similar. But for 2025 in particular, we'll get more specific about that in February of next year.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nGlobal Head of Telecommunications Services Research, Raymond James\n\nThanks. Yeah. I want to follow up on Simon's question there on the dividend. I appreciate you can't give a lot of color there yet. But what kind of payout ratio are you trying to achieve then? Is it then like 100% of attributable AFFO per share? Was it more like 90%? And the growth rate's going to be more on that long-term, again, board decision. But is it more a payout ratio, or is it an absolute level, or is it growth that you're kind of pairing up dividend per share with attributable AFFO per share?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nWell, if we continue to grow it kind of in line with our AFFO per share growth, you can think of that payout ratio staying kind of in that 60% to 65 range.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nGlobal Head of Telecommunications Services Research, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Makes sense. And then one question, go ahead.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nI would just add to that quickly, Ric, that that 65% range, it does leave us between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of additional, let's say, AFFO to put towards other uses, either CapEx or anything else we want to do. So that ratio of that 60% to 65 kind of fits in well with giving us a lot of financial flexibility to invest capital.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nGlobal Head of Telecommunications Services Research, Raymond James\n\nIt's a good thing not to pay it all out and leave yourself some money to grow the business. Appreciate that. One question we get a lot, and Steve, you've talked to a lot on the call already, prepared marketing questions, Michael and others, about US green shoots, possibility of improvement. A lot of investors we talk to always look to carrier CapEx. And you've pointed to it as well.\nI view carrier CapEx as an indicator, but not a perfect linear indicator of leasing. Can you help us understand how you look at carrier CapEx and why it may or may not be a perfect indicator to what can happen in any given quarter or year on the leasing activity you see?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. I'm happy to. Thanks for the question, Ric. So when you look at carrier CapEx, first, I would point out that we're seeing the estimates for carrier CapEx in 5G are around that $35 to 36 billion per year mark on average. And that's up about $5 or 6 billion from what we saw in 4G, and that was up $5 or 6 billion from 3G. So we do see overall CapEx increasing. The reason it's not a perfect algorithm for growth on the tower side is that CapEx goes to a lot of different uses.\nIt's not all going into the Radio Access Network that goes on towers. Some of that CapEx goes into the core of the network, and some of it goes into the fiber to connect the network. And so there's a lot of CapEx that's not related to just the RAN on the sites. So it's not a perfect algorithm for that. And in fact, I think I'd point you to one of my customers' comments earlier this year where they said that their C-band deployments will continue at pace and that the savings that they're getting in their CapEx this year is coming from core and fiber.\nSo when we think about carrier CapEx, what we're really trying to focus on is what we think the CapEx is going to be on the tower sites themselves. And while the carriers don't break that out specifically, that's where we take our market intelligence and what we're hearing from the teams on the ground to get a better idea from our perspective of what the activity is going to be based on what they're preparing to do on their sites. So the CapEx does matter. If they're spending more CapEx, that does imply, generally speaking, more activity. Less means less. But it's not a perfect algorithm.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nGlobal Head of Telecommunications Services Research, Raymond James\n\nSure. And back to another thing Michael pointed out, it seems to us also that if you do see the shift from coverage and amendment activity to new lease activity, and new colocations, typically your average rent is going to be higher, obviously, for a new lease than an amendment, even though CapEx might not be very different at a carrier. Is that another possibility?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah, that's a possibility, Ric. A new lease rate is typically higher than an amendment rate. But you get more amendments than you do new leases. So there's a little bit of a trade-off there. But look, it's all positive, and it's all the things that underpin our long-term guidance. And that's what our expectation for growth is. It's a combination of new leases and amendment as we go through a 5G cycle. It's a long cycle, and it's going to replicate very closely what we saw in 4G and 3G. And that's what we're seeing play out today.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nGlobal Head of Telecommunications Services Research, Raymond James\n\nThat helps. I want to circle back to the last one for me. Rod, you mentioned obviously you have excess cash that you can use for capital allocation, construction projects that meet returns. But you would also think stock buyback comes into the equation at some point. I know you're trying to get to the 5.0. Help us understand the process getting through India, and then what would trigger and allow you to think that stock buybacks are an available option given where the stock prices are?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower",
    "content2": "Yeah, it's a great question, Ric. And as Steve and I have been saying really for the last couple of quarters, we are very focused on driving organic growth, very focused on driving operational efficiency, reducing our overall directs and SG&A cost to drive AFFO and AFFO per share growth. Where, when it comes to capital allocation, we're very focused on delevering and strengthening our balance sheet and continuing momentum of adding CapEx and with the best projects that we see driving quality of earnings, the right risk profile, the right growth profile over the long-term. So all that is clear and remains our focus.\nYou did see we are at 5x this quarter in terms of net leverage. We've achieved our goal for Q1. I'll point out, Ric, for you that that was benefited by the payments that we saw in India in the absence of, let's say, the need for the reserve that we had in our outlook. So there is some timing benefits there that could be as much as $40 to 45 million in Q1. What that means is we expect that leverage during the year will back up above 5x slightly between now and the end of the year. We're going to continue to work on getting that down to 5x in a sustainable way. The goal is by the end of the year.\nNow, we may not get there, but we'll be very close, I think, and we'll be in good shape. So with all that said, at some point when we have leverage at our target range or below in a sustained fashion, then I think all options are on the table. At that point, we regain full financial flexibility. In order to really engage in buybacks, I think we'd want to see more certainty around the economics, more certainty around issues of inflation, interest rates, and those sorts of things. Today, I think we all appreciate the fact that there is still a fair amount of uncertainty there.\nWe're going to be prudent in making sure our balance sheet is strong and that we're managing the business effectively to drive AFFO growth. That means reducing our floating rate debt, reducing our vulnerability, let's say, to changes in short-term rates. That's kind of the focus for this year.\nSo, I would say when you think about buybacks, Ric, it's probably more towards the end of this year we'll be reassessing things. At that point, I think we'll be in a little bit different position when it comes to sustained leverage. Hopefully, by then, there's more certainty in the economic outlook and where interest rates are going. And at that point, we can do a full consideration of different allocation options.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nGlobal Head of Telecommunications Services Research, Raymond James\n\nWell, I sure hope some more certainty and visibility. Thanks so much, guys. Have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess my first question would just be related to foreign currency movements. We've been seeing some pretty extraordinary moves in the last six months, the Argentine peso, the Nigerian naira, and even more recently, the yen. Could you kind of share with us any evolution in your thinking around hedging and how that might be impacting your outlooks as you give them for the year?\nAnd then the second question would be, similarly, we seem to be at an inflection point, maybe in fixed wireless access, some carriers getting more aggressive, some carriers getting less aggressive. Could you kind of share how you are looking at fixed wireless access as an increasing contributor or a decreasing contributor to your growth outlook for the macro side? Thank you.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, David. Thanks for the question. I'll hit the FX one, and then I think Steve will take the one on fixed wireless. So when it comes to FX, you're absolutely right to point out we do have some FX headwinds in the business. That's clear. This year, the FX headwinds that we're really seeing are coming through Africa and primarily in Nigeria, which I think you're aware of.\nSo when you look at outlook to outlook, we're down about $15 million in this guide on property revenue, just about $5 million on EBITDA on AFFO, which is about a penny dilution or headwind when it comes to the outlook adjustment there. And the puts and takes there are we've seen, although for the year, year on year, we have an FX tailwind across Latin America. Outlook to outlook, there's a bit of a headwind that brewed up here in the first quarter.\nAnd then we have the opposite in Africa, where we have a pretty significant headwind in FX across the region year on year. But outlook to outlook is actually a positive kind of tailwind in Africa. So not all currencies kind of move together. We certainly benefit at times more than others in terms of the portfolio effect, where if one currency is under pressure, another one may be up a little bit. If you look at the spot rates, we actually could improve revs by about $17 million. It's too early to build that into our outlook, but that's what the spots would tell us.\nSo from a hedging standpoint, I mean, one of the things that we've done is we've diversified our debt structure quite a bit in the last several years. We're up now to about $7.5 billion of euro denominated debt to kind of match up with our euro-based business that we have in Europe. The other thing I would say is the international businesses that we have, let's say, across Latin America, Africa, and APAC, the cash flow that we generate there, we continue to kind of reinvest back in the business if we don't take it out through our intercompany lending. Of course, when you have devaluation, we're still operating in local currency in those markets.\nOur P&L is denominated in local currency. So all of the revenues and expenses are all in local currency. So a lot of it is translational. There isn't a lot of hedging that we can do or we think is prudent to do in Africa and Latin America. But reinvesting those cash flows back into assets in those regions, I think, is a pretty good long-term play in terms of creating value for our shareholders. But with that said, to the extent that we see any markets that have outsized FX headwinds, that certainly comes into our capital allocation thinking. And one of the benefits of our portfolio is it is very broad. And we don't have to invest capital in every country every year.\nWe can allocate it where it makes most sense for our shareholders and where it will create the most value. And we do that actively and dynamically. The other thing you've heard us say this before, David, we certainly build FX headwinds or FX impacts into our underwriting model. It's in all of our deals. So we do weighted average cost of capital country by country. We also have the Fisher Effect and expectation of inflation differentials between the foreign country as well as the US currency that we invest in. We build that in out over the long-term within the model.\nSo it's hard to get FX right in the short-term, but I think when you pull that out over a 20, 30-year period, you have a much better chance of getting that right in the long-term model. So in terms of our underwriting over the long-term, we still feel good about the portfolio that we have and our ability to handle the FX. But it is important to know that in the short-term, we have the ability to lean in and out of different places depending on what's happening. And FX is one of those things that we would certainly be looking at.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. I would just add that we also use contractual mechanisms to also control that to some extent. It's very important for us to have CPI-linked escalators in all those international markets to make sure that you do recover some of the differential that you have from inflation from the US and those markets. In some markets, we also will have some of the revenues pegged to US dollar. For example, in Nigeria, about 40% of the revenue in Nigeria is pass-through of power. And so that's kind of passing through at the same rate that we're paying it.\nSo that's a little bit of a natural hedge. Of the remaining 60%, about half of that is pegged to the US dollar. Now, we get paid in Naira, but it's pegged to whatever the exchange rate is when we go out there. So we do use contractual mechanisms to hedge as well, as well as what Rod said, that most of our expenses are local currency expenses. So there's some natural hedge there as well.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nOn fixed wireless.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nOh, fixed wireless. So on the fixed wireless side, look, we're seeing our carrier customers aggressively leaning into fixed wireless. And we've always said that that might be one of the first use cases of 5G, and we're seeing that play out. And I think the numbers are about 10 million subs that we're at total for fixed wireless in the US. At this point, we're not seeing them deploy standalone fixed wireless networks by the major carriers. We do have standalone fixed wireless for some of the small guys, the WISPs, and people like that. But at this point, the carriers continue to utilize the excess capacity they have in their current builds.\nWhat that means for the long-term, I think it's too early to say. I'm encouraged by the ARPUs they're getting, the growth that they're seeing, the competitiveness that they're showing with the fixed line broadband. And if those trends continue and if they're able to kind of underwrite some additional incremental network builds to support that, that would be upside to our base case.\nWhen we've set our long-term guide in the US, we were not anticipating any type of a standalone fixed wireless build or incremental network activity driven by fixed wireless. So that would be upside for us if it happens. But I think it's too early to tell right now if that's going to drive a lot of additional business or not.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on CoreSite, your MMR per cab growth has been really strong. Steve, you talked about that a little bit earlier. I guess, can you help to decompose the drivers a bit more? How like-for-like pricing gains versus mix changes versus higher consumption per cabinet might be driving that? And you also noted that you had a record quarter for retail signings in the quarter. I guess, more generally, can you comment on the mix of retail versus scale deals that you've had in recent periods and what's in your funnel today?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Let me attack the first part of that. So when you look at pricing across our markets, what's really driving it is supply-demand dynamics. And so we're seeing similar increases in retail, scale, and hyperscale pricing in those markets. There's probably a little bit more increase in hyperscale at this point because contiguous capacity is becoming more rare, and because it had the lowest pricing to begin with kind of in the markets. So what we've seen across all of our markets is the supply is less than the demand. And part of that's just, I think, AI and other use cases have taken off faster than people expected.\nAnd the entire ecosystem has not provided as much capacity as what people are seeking. And that's really the underlying driver for what that pricing is happening in our facilities. Our funnel has a healthy mix of retail and scale. I don't have the exact breakdown at my fingertips, but a lot of that's driven by what capacity we have to sell and what contiguous capacity is out there for some of the scale installations. And so depending on which facility and which market, we could be flexible in terms of what we offer people, and we could be selective on the customers.\nBecause CoreSite is really an interconnection hub, it's not just a retail or colocation facility. We don't write all the business that comes to us. We're not a low-cost provider per se in those markets. People come to us because of the interconnection we provide. And so we curate a mix, and we try to balance networks, cloud players, and enterprises with a healthy mix of retail in a way that gives us the kind of industry-leading returns on our capital that CoreSite was delivering before we bought them and that we continue to use to underwrite our model there.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHey, Steve, have higher power densities influenced the MMR per cab at all, or is it more just the like-for-like pricing dynamic you described?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nI mean, certainly, we price the higher density cabinets more because they're taking up more power. So that does influence it. We did have a press release a couple of weeks ago about being NVIDIA-certified in some of our facilities. And so certainly, when you're putting GPUs in versus CPUs, there's a pricing differential on that cabinet. But really, what's driving the pricing increases across the board are the supply-demand dynamics.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Okay. And can I ask one on expenses? You've always run a pretty tight ship from that perspective. It seems like you're running even tighter than normal this year. I guess, can you drill down into any of the specific actions you're taking to really help keep costs down?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Let me give you kind of the backdrop to it, and then I can give you a few examples. So over the last decade, we've been in a rapid growth mode in a lot of our markets. When you're growing very quickly and you're buying and integrating assets, you're really focused on that piece of it and making sure that no balls drop and that you're providing good customer service, etc. Now that we're not buying a lot of assets and integrating them, it's a good time for us to really focus on operational excellence.\nSo across the board, what we're doing is we're looking at our operations and saying, how can we be better without negatively impacting customer service or the future of our business? So we're being very careful that we're not damaging the long-term trajectory of the business with it, but we are finding opportunities to do things more efficiently. And I would say what we're doing today is kind of phase I, and that's each market is looking at what they can do on their own. And then there is an opportunity that we're focused on to more globalize the business.\nAnd that's taking best practices from each market in terms of what their expertise is and taking that to other markets to see if we can drive additional efficiencies there. For example, in the US, we've automated a lot of our processes. The question that we're asking ourselves is, can we take those automations and use them internationally to drive even more efficiency there? In Africa, we are extremely efficient with how we use fuel in our power as a service business.\nWe're looking at that and saying, can we export those practices to other markets like the US? Right now, we're being very deliberate in kind of chasing the low-hanging fruit that's just inherent in the business after coming off a decade of growth. Then we're going to be very thoughtful about continuing to look at those costs as we try to become as efficient as we can everywhere we can over time.\n\nNick Del Deo\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the trend you're seeing in LATAM? I think the quarter came in a bit ahead of your outlook. An update on activity and maybe expected churn from Oi, any exposure to its wireline business would be helpful. And just a second question on your build-to-suit program across regions. Any changes given the macro pressures or some regional risks that you're seeing? Thank you.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nGo ahead, Rod.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Batya. This is Rod. I'll start with LATAM and give you a little insight on the trends there. So we're seeing, for the outlook for 2024, LATAM is going to be coming in around 2% organic tenant billings growth. That's coming with about 3% being contributed via the colocation and amendment revenue. And if you put that up against prior year, it's pretty flat.\nSo we're seeing a steady level of demand and activity across Latin America in that 3-ish percent for new business. The escalators are also in that 4%, so a touch above that. That's actually down, kind of moderating because inflation across the region has come down. So last year, that was north of 7%. This year, it's about 4%. So that's a big driver of any headline change that you'll see is just the moderation of that inflation. The good news is we also are seeing a lower level of churn. So churn is about 5% in this year's guide.\nLast year, it was up closer to 6%. Within that 5% churn, almost half of it is coming from Oi, which I know you're familiar with. That'll take a couple more years to kind of work through, and we will sort of get to the other side there. And then we would expect that more normalized overall growth will come back in the region. But it will take a couple of years before we get there. When you think about maybe just hitting the wireline side of Oi, you probably saw a couple of comments come out publicly around the wireline of Oi and what they're doing. But I'll give you a couple of numbers here.\nThey represent about $35 to 40 million of revenue for us in our LATAM business. We did agree to about a 20% discount. That is assumed in our outlook. So there's no negative impact to the outlook that we have out on the street based on that. That means that comes into about $7 million on a per-year basis over the next couple of years in terms of the discount.\nAnd as part of the transaction, we will also be taking ownership of certain sites down there from Oi. I'm not going to give you a count or any more detail there. We've got a little bit of work to do to look at that. But we have kind of worked through that. So we'll be working through the remaining churn down in LATAM. We do think it's temporary, but we also do think that you'll see kind of relatively low growth for the region for the next couple of years. Let's say lower single digits in that 2% to 4 range, let's say.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just the build-to-suit update.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah. In terms of the build-to-suits, I mean, we're keeping that consistent up in the range of a couple thousand, 2,500 to 3,500. Q1, the volumes were a little bit lower, but we do expect that to increase. We continue to see strong demand for us building towers for our customers across Africa and also in Europe. So we certainly have been happy with that. We're being fairly disciplined with the higher cost of capital, looking to make sure that pricing around build-to-suit reflects the new reality. But we still see several thousand sites that we can build every year. And I would say the volumes have come down a little bit.\nBut one of the results of that is the quality, let's say, has increased because we're really being very selective on where we build, who we build for, and what assets we build. As we look at the macro environment with the uncertainty around rates and cost of capital, we're being extremely disciplined.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question today comes from the line of Jon Atkin from RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nJon Atkin\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nThanks. Question about MLAs, maybe a two-parter. To what extent do you use them internationally? I know a lot of it is paid by the drink, but maybe just update us on holistic MLAs and to what extent they're used internationally. And then as we look into maybe year-end 2025, anything changing around the holistic portions of your domestic MLAs that roll off or even take effect? Thanks.\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. So when it comes to our international markets, we have a variety of contract structures, and sometimes they depend on whether it's with an acquisition that we did or build-to-suit or a bigger part of the business there. So I would say there's a lot more variation in terms of how we construct our contracts internationally. We do have a couple of holistic-type deals internationally. Again, a little bit different flavor than we would have in the US, but we do try to utilize those contract structures. I think that's something that may be an opportunity for us over time, but it takes time to get the customers to understand those.\nThey're not typically used in a lot of those markets. And so kind of educating them on the benefits of those type structures and seeing the experience that our US customers have had in terms of being able to continue to utilize those agreements and see value from them is something that may take some time. In terms of the US agreements at the end of the year this year, there's nothing that we would point to specifically on that that we're talking about publicly at this point. So I wouldn't expect a ton of change there.\n\nJon Atkin\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nAnd any change into 2025, given that these are often five years in duration?\n\nSteve Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nWell, look, it's a little early for us to be giving any type of guidance for 2025. But look, we think that our fundamental growth algorithm kind of holds true. And so when we look at 2025, we continue to see strong fundamentals in our business. And that includes a continuation of solid US and Canada organic tenant billings growth. Even while we're still absorbing some headwinds associated with that final transfer Sprint churn that happens in Q4 of this year, we see leasing volumes in Africa and Europe remaining positive with churn remaining low in Europe, and an expectation for further moderation of churn in Africa.\nContinued strong growth from CoreSite, especially as we're commencing those kind of record levels of new business that we've signed since the transaction was consummated. And we'll complement that top-line growth with, again, continuing to focus on margin expansion, cost discipline, and continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation. Now, that growth is going to be a little bit offset by the headwinds we have in Latin America because we do see an elevated consolidation churn environment there for the next few years. And that's going to keep Latin America kind of in that low single-digit growth.\nAnd then, again, when you think about 2025 and beyond, there's a lot of variables that we're keeping our eyes on, like FX rates, interest rates. Services is inherently harder to predict, so we won't be trying to guide anything on that until early next year. And then the timing of the India closing will also have an impact on what that AFFO per share growth rate is. Although we think we've been very clear about what that means to us, I think most of our investors understand the variability on that with the timing. But all those kind of variables, we think, point to our long-term growth algorithm remaining strong in 2025 and beyond.\n\nJon Atkin\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and FP&A, American Tower\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining the call today.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 now. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, American Tower\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website www.americantower.com. I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondren, our President and CEO, and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.\nExamples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance, our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC.\nWe urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying it's an honor and a privilege to step into the role of CEO at American Tower. I want to thank Tom Bartlett for his leadership over the last 15 years at the company and congratulate him on an exceptional career. I certainly recognize I have big shoes to fill, and to all of our stakeholders, I look forward to continuing to build on the tremendous success we've achieved together today.\nIn recent weeks, I've been telling many of our employees, customers, and investors that I'm more excited today by the opportunity ahead than I've been in my 20 plus years with the company. There are two key reasons for that.\nFirst, we're still in the early stages of a mobility and computing driven technology wave that suggests distributed digital infrastructure is going to be in higher demand for the foreseeable future. Second, we've spent the last two decades developing a leading global portfolio with real estate, power, and interconnection platforms that will serve as the core backbone of this wave.\nI believe we're now positioned to harvest the benefits of the scaled differentiated tower and data center platforms we built to provide unique value for our customers and best in class growth, profitability, and returns for our investors. To deliver on that opportunity, we're going to be zeroing in on a few key areas in 2024 and beyond. To begin, we're committed to operating the highest quality portfolio.\nThis means owning and investing in assets in the most attractive geographies where secular demand trends signal the potential for long-term sustained growth. Equally as important, it means securing business with market leaders, maintaining contract structures that maximize organic growth and minimize downside risks, as well as attracting and securing accretive development opportunities afforded by our in-market scale and leading operational capabilities.\nWe saw the clear benefits of these factors play out in 2023 in our anchor US and Canada tower business. The 5G investment cycle and contributions from our comprehensive MLAs drove a record of roughly $230 million in colocation and amendment growth. International performance was also driven by record organic new business growth contributions and further supported by critical CPI-linked escalator terms, and growth from our build-to-suit and Power as a Service programs.\nFurthermore, our differentiated CoreSite interconnection business saw its second consecutive year of record signed new business.\nGoing forward, we're going to continue our focus on maximizing organic growth across our existing assets and complement that with incremental revenue generation through select development opportunities. At the same time, we'll continue to actively assess and challenge our prior capital allocation decisions to ensure the opportunity we see ahead across our global footprint is still supportive of our original underwriting thesis and apply what we've learned over the last two decades to our deployment plans going forward.\nUltimately, we're focused on operating a portfolio that provides the proper mix of risk exposure and can deliver high quality sustained top line growth supported by an operating structure that drives outsized rates of conversion to profitability and commands a premium in the market.\nThat's a good segue into the next area of focus, which is delivering the most efficient global operating model centered around cost discipline, margin expansion, and increasing returns on invested capital. Our global and regional scale and long operating track record present an opportunity to further improve on the operating leverage inherent in the neutral host infrastructure model. We're accelerating initiatives in our regional operations to bring down direct cost per site.\nWe're also investing in experimentation and implementation of AI applications and other technologies that create a more cost and time efficient equipment deployment cycle, bring greater precision and lower cost to our maintenance operations, and improve yields on renewable energy generation. Just to name a few examples.\nWhen it comes to our overhead costs, as you'll see in our 2024 guidance, we're targeting a reduction in SG&A, which combined with healthy top line growth is supporting an 80 basis points reduction in cash SG&A as a percentage of property revenue and an approximately 200 basis points expansion in cash adjusted EBITDA margin since 2022. Continued improvement to our cost structure and driving profitability is going to be a cornerstone of our growth algorithm going forward.\nNext, and as we've highlighted on past calls, we're working today to further reinforce our balance sheet as a strategic asset. Our investment grade credit rating is at the core of our strategy, and that's not going to change. In fact, I believe market access and cost of capital advantages may be of even more strategic importance in this cycle, but more than they were over the last decade.\nAs Rod will elaborate on further, we made substantial progress towards strengthening the balance sheet in 2023, and as we look to 2024 and beyond, our capital allocation program is going to prioritize resiliency and flexibility in this evolving economic environment. Together with other strategic initiatives like reducing our overall capital intensity and executing on cost savings across the business, we'll hold the dividend relatively flat in 2024, subject to board approval.\nIn turn, we'll prioritize a reduction to our gross debt balance and accelerate the pathway to achieving our net leverage target and enhance financial flexibility. As we've highlighted in the past, while M&A is not a priority today. As a company, we want to be in a position of strength when and if strategically relevant portfolios that meet our investment criteria do come to the market. In our internal CapEx program, we'll continue investing to expand our existing tower and data center platforms by selecting the opportunities with the highest risk-adjusted rates of return.\nAt American Tower, we've developed a unique ability to allocate capital between our US and international tower businesses as well as our US-based CoreSite platform. We see this as a distinct competitive advantage while we continue to view the tower business as the best model out there.\nThe flexibility we're building into our CapEx program and the robust cash flow our assets generate allow us to be nimble and responsive to market conditions as we make capital allocation decisions over time, which in the near term means growing our exposure to developed markets.\nIn our outlook for 2024, a larger share of our development capital is going toward the US and Europe, including expanding within our CoreSite footprint, where the same demand trends that have resulted in two consecutive years of record new leasing are expected to drive stabilized returns in the mid teens for ongoing development projects. We're balancing that with an expectation to build around 3,000 new tower sites, primarily in our international markets.\nThis does represent a decline in volumes compared to 2022 and 2023, particularly as we assess certain risks in our emerging market footprint, including the FX volatility we've seen recently in Africa. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see partnering with market leaders to grow our tower portfolio globally as a key component of our long term growth algorithm.\nSimply put, the changes in the global macroeconomic environment we've seen over the last 24 months and our balance sheet priorities have raised the bar when it comes to required returns, and you're seeing discipline and flexibility reflected in the capital allocation expectations that we're rolling out for 2024. Finally, and foundational to our strategy are the people throughout the global business.\nEverything I've talked about today hinges on the dedication and performance of our teams across the globe and the impact we can make for our customers, investors, and the communities we serve. I've been so impressed by the teams I've met with and heard from over recent weeks, and we're going to continue strengthening our organization around the world and focus on developing, attracting, and rewarding the best talent in the industry.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate my comments from the outset. I believe there's tremendous opportunity ahead for American Tower. Evolving technology trends continue to drive demand for more ubiquitous, dense, low latency distributed networks.\nAgainst those trends, we're going to leverage our leading tower and data center platforms, balance sheet strength, capital allocation discipline, and the dedicated teams that are supporting our global business to present a truly differentiated value proposition and compelling growth and return opportunities for shareholders. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our 2023 results and 2024 outlook.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2023 financial results and our expectations for 2024, I will highlight a few key achievements from the past year. First, we closed a successful 2023 with a strong fourth quarter exceeding our prior outlook midpoints across property revenue and adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO per share, with full year 2023 results comfortably beating our initial guidance from a year ago.\nFor the year, performance was anchored by continued demand for our diverse global asset portfolio, resulting in over 6% consolidated organic tenant billings growth, an acceleration of over 300 basis points as compared to 2022, with our US and Canada and international segments each delivering record colocation and amendment growth of roughly $230 million and nearly $150 million respectively.\nAdditionally, we marked another record year of signed new business for CoreSite supporting digital transformation across diverse workloads and emerging technologies, including, more recently, AI use cases. Furthermore, our focus on cost management combined with the inherent operating leverage in the Tower model and certain one-time benefits resulted in an attractive year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I'll touch on in a moment.\nSecond, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet through organic deleveraging and the successful issuance of approximately $7 billion in fixed rate debt. As a result of our 2023 actions, we've extended our average maturity and reduced our exposure to floating rate debt to less than 11% of the total debt stack, down from over 22% at the start of the year, closing the fourth quarter with net leverage of 5.2x.\nWe are on track to meet the upper end of our 3x to 5x net leverage goal by the end of 2024. Finally, we concluded the strategic review of our India business earlier this year, reaching a definitive agreement to sell 100% of ATC India to Brookfield, which we will refer to as the India Sale.\nWe believe this transaction, together with the Mexico Fiber and Poland divestitures in 2023, enhances our global portfolio mix and risk profile and positions American Tower for sustained high-quality earnings growth over the long term. Now let's discuss the details of our full year 2023 results. Turning to Slide 6, full year consolidated property revenue growth was over 5% and nearly 7% on an FX neutral basis.\nTenant billings growth was 7.2% with organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%, complemented by the construction of nearly 3,200 new builds primarily in our international markets. In the United States and Canada, property revenue growth was over 4% with organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% or 6.6%. Excluding Sprint churn, our international property revenue grew by over 5% and including organic tenant billings growth of 7.7% with each segment meeting or exceeding our prior outlook.\nAdditionally, in Q4 we were able to reverse approximately $38 million of prior revenue reserves associated with customer collections in India, contributing to outperformance versus our prior outlook, closing the year with a net revenue reserve associated with customer collections in India of approximately $28 million.\nFinally, our data center segment contributed approximately $835 million to our total property revenue in 2023, representing year-over-year growth of nearly 9% and, as I mentioned earlier, delivering another record year of signed new business.\nMoving on, Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 7% or around 7.5% on an FX neutral basis and to over $7 billion on a consolidated basis. Cash-adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 170 basis points year-over-year to 62.3%, primarily driven by strong organic growth and certain one-time benefits combined with a keen focus on cost management throughout the business, with cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down over 30 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7%. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by over 2% and 1% respectively.\nGrowth on a per share basis absorbed negative impacts of approximately 7% in financing costs and another 1% from FX. Now, before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2024, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, and as Steve mentioned, we are committed to owning and operating the highest quality portfolio supported by a strong balance sheet.\nWith that commitment in mind, we are focused on continuing to drive compelling organic growth across our diverse portfolio of assets while maximizing the conversion of top line growth to profitability by taking costs out of the business, together with reducing our aggregate capital intensity for the second year in a row, and maintaining a relatively flat dividend payout in 2024 as compared to 2023, subject to board approval.\nWe believe these collective actions will maximize recurring cash flow growth, further strengthen our balance sheet, and, as a result, accelerate our pathway to financial flexibility and optionality. We'll get into more detail shortly. Next, we are assuming a full year contribution of the India business in our outlook, representing over $1.16 billion in property revenue, $360 million of Adjusted EBITDA, and $285 million for unlevered AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders.\nUpon closing of the India sale, which we anticipate occurring during the second half of 2024, subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals, we will then revise our outlook assumptions to incorporate the transaction for added transparency. We have included slide 20 in this earnings presentation, which shows the India contributions to our outlook by quarter. Assuming a potential closing on 1 October 2024 for your reference, we would anticipate a reduction of $295 million and $95 million to our presented outlook midpoints for property revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA respectively.\nFurthermore, we would estimate an approximately nine-cent reduction to attributable AFFO per share, which assumes anticipated proceeds at closing are used to pay down existing indebtedness. Also, within the India segment, we have included approximately $65 million in incremental revenue reserves for the full year, translating to a reduction of $0.14 to attributable AFFO per share.\nAlthough we are encouraged by the positive collection results realized in the second half of 2023, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative view at this point in time. Additionally, we've assumed the forward rate curve to support our 2024 interest rate assumptions, including the cost of our floating rate debt and assumptions for refinancing our 2024 senior note maturities.\nLastly, on the FX side, our outlook reflects estimated negative translational impacts of approximately $191 million on property revenue, $132 million for Adjusted EBITDA, and $82 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2023. With that, let's dive into the numbers moving to the details on slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenue of over $11.1 billion, representing an increase year over year of greater than 1% and 3% on an FX neutral basis.\nOur guide includes cash revenue growth of around $200 million in the US and Canada segment and $225 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions excluding pass-through. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $80 million of growth in cash revenue in 2024, demonstrating nearly 10% growth year-over-year excluding the impacts of straight-line property revenue, also includes an approximately $203 million step-down in non-cash straight-line revenue, or approximately 2% headwind to growth, partially offset by approximately $28 million increase in pass-through.\nLastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate an FX headwind of nearly 2% or $191 million to consolidated property revenue growth. Turning to Slide 8, we expect another solid year of organic growth contributions from our US and Canada, and international segments.\nIn the US and Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% or 6% excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes another healthy year of colocation and amendment growth contributions of $180 million to 190 million reflecting the expected step down from our record level achievement in 2023, though still approximately 20% higher than our 2016-2022 average internationally.\nStarting with Africa, we expect a strong momentum from 2023 to continue with expected organic tenant billings growth of 11% to 12%. This includes colocation and amendment contributions of approximately 7% along with escalator growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by churn of around 4%, which would represent a notable year-over-year improvement after incurring the largest impacts from carrier consolidation in 2023. Turning to Europe, 2024 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 5% to 6%.\nOn the colocation and amendment front, we anticipate growth of 3% to 4%, an acceleration as compared to 2023, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 3% consistent with 2023. Churn is expected to remain low at around 1% in Latin America.\nConsistent with our previous messaging, we expect organic tenant billings growth to step down as compared to 2023 to approximately 2% for the year as churn will remain elevated at around 5% primarily due to Oi. In Brazil, churn is offset by relatively consistent colocation and amendment activity of approximately 3% and contributions from escalators of approximately 4%. Finally, in Asia Pacific we are guiding to approximately 2% organic tenant billings growth in 2024, including colocation and amendment growth of approximately 3.5%, roughly 2.5% from escalators, and churn of around 4%.\nMoving on to Slide 9 at the midpoint of our outlook, we expect Adjusted EBITDA growth of less than 1% and approximately 2.5% on an FX neutral basis while absorbing a negative impact of over 3% associated with net straight line. Complementing the strong revenue growth trends I mentioned earlier, we're planning to reduce cash SG&A by approximately $30 million as compared to 2023, contributing to cash Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of around 30 basis points.\nAdditionally, our outlook includes an expectation for approximately $17 million in year over year gross margin growth from our US services business, with the quarterly cadence suggesting a ramp up in carrier activity in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 10, we expect attributable AFFO per share to grow approximately 5% year over year to $10.33 and approximately 6.5% on an FX neutral basis.\nGrowth in cash-adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in maintenance CapEx is partially offset by an increase in financing costs and cash taxes, together with higher minority interest adjustments due to growth in our European and data center JVs. Moving on to Slide 11, I'll review our capital plans for 2024 and our balance sheet priorities for the upcoming year.\nIn 2024 we will continue to focus on organic growth, quality of earnings, and operational efficiency while prioritizing balance sheet strength, reducing risk, and channeling discretionary spending into capital projects that support sustainable earnings growth and yield the most attractive risk-adjusted returns. Consistent with the messaging on our Q3 2023 earnings call, the 2024 plan assumes maintaining an annual common dividend distribution of approximately $3 billion, representing a modest increase on an annual per share basis to $6.48 per share.\nWe also expect to evenly distribute the dividend across each quarter of the year, which would suggest a one-time sequential step down from our Q4 2023 declared dividend of $1.70 to 1.62 in Q1 2024, all subject to board approval. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.6 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary.\nAs Steve highlighted in his remarks, we view the flexibility of our CapEx deployments with options across a range of geographies and assets to be a distinct competitive advantage for American Tower in our ability to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders in 2024. This means increasing our CapEx allocation and exposure towards our developed markets.\nThis includes increasing development spend for existing CoreSite data center campuses to $450 million as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and 2023 and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity while continuing to drive attractive targeted stabilized deals in the mid teens. The balance of the development CapEx spend will support another year of solid new build volumes internationally, which assumes the construction of 3,000 sites at the midpoint.\nMoving to the right side of the slide and as I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet in 2023 through recurring business growth augmented with cost discipline, and combined with the strategic management of our capital allocation plans. We anticipate meeting the upper end of our 3 to 5x net leverage range by year end.\nOur steadfast commitment to maintaining an investment grade credit rating and enhancing our balance sheet strength and financial flexibility remains unchanged. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary, our global business continues to demonstrate solid core growth and resiliency in 2023, augmented by strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our quality of earnings, driving operational efficiency, and strengthening our already strong balance sheet.\nWe believe successful execution of these initiatives provides a strong foundation for 2024 and enhances our position as a leader in the global communications infrastructure industry. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities, adapt to challenges, and deliver compelling risk adjusted returns to our shareholders for years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero. Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Good morning and Steve, congrats on the new role and the very best for that. I appreciate the initial comments on your priorities. I wanted to come back to this highest quality portfolio point that you were making. Is there some sort of review process where you're sort of formally going through each of the markets and just looking at what fits and what doesn't and what you want to do about that? Or is it more kind of investing more in these developed markets? Any color around that? And I'm thinking about markets like Nigeria where we've obviously had a challenging FX environment here.\nHow do you think about some of those more challenged markets in the near and medium term? And then you mentioned data center several times in your comments. I know that Rod noted the CapEx is going up here. How are you thinking beyond the existing campuses, either domestically or internationally? Certainly a huge opportunity in that business. And again, a business where scale really matters.\nThanks.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Well, thanks Simon. Thanks for the good wishes there. I'll take that couple of pieces here. So I'll start out with what do we mean by the highest quality portfolio? And what we mean by that is we're constantly reassessing all of our portfolios both domestically and abroad and rechallenging all the decisions we made about capital allocation in the past to say, do they still meet our investment criteria criteria?\nAnd if there's a challenge in a business, our first choice is to say what can we do to fix that? How can we get it to meet those criteria? And then the second thing we would look at is ongoing capital allocation and is it a market or a business we want to continue to put capital into?\nSo when we talk about the best quality portfolio, what we're saying is that we continue to look at that, refine our assumptions there. I did mention in my comments that if you look at a market like Nigeria, the macroeconomic conditions, including some of the FX translation issues, have caused us to raise the bar in terms of required returns.\nSo when we talk about that portfolio, we're looking at the market, the asset class, the demand for the assets, the contract structures we have in place, what types of contractual protections we can get for something like an FX devaluation. And we're shaping the portfolio for that. Having said that, there's nothing to report beyond what we've already talked about in terms of the strategic review we did on India. You know, we've been very clear that we're going to exit that market.\nWe did exit Poland because it wasn't to scale for us and we did choose to exit Mexico Fiber. We'll continue to look at those, those other businesses that we have and make assessments on those. There's nothing I would point to today to say that we're going to make any portfolio changes in the near term. The second question I think you asked was how do we think about a market like Nigeria?\nWe believe that the emerging market portfolio is still an important part of our growth algorithm going forward. We think that having the appropriate level of risk there to complement our developed market strategy will continue to allow us to elongate our growth curve over time there.\nWe are mindful that there are some near-term challenges that we're seeing there. You're seeing that play out in some of our capital allocation decisions as we're rotating some of our discretionary CapEx toward developed markets versus the emerging markets. You've also seen that play out in recent years with some of the inorganic acquisitions we've done.\nWe did InSite in the US, CoreSite in the US, Celsius in Europe, and those all had the effect of reducing our emerging market exposure. Divesting India will reduce our emerging market exposure. If we continue to allocate more of our development CapEx to developed markets versus emerging markets, that will also decrease our emerging market exposure.\nSo what you're essentially seeing play out there is us rebalancing our portfolio a little bit in response to the macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing, which we think is the appropriate thing to do in any environment is to look at the portfolio and rebalance it. And so that leads back into that highest quality portfolio.\nThe second question I think you had was around CoreSite and what are we focused on there. Right now most of our development CapEx is focused on expanding our existing campuses, and if you look at how that business has performed, we've had two years of record leasing and we need to replenish the capacity that we have sold in those campuses, and it's a very good use of our capital. Again, we're looking at stabilized returns in the mid teens.\nAnd if you think about the projects we have under development, they're more than 40% pre-leased as of the end of the year. And so when you think about that business, pre-leasing is something that wasn't as prevalent in CoreSite pre-acquisition. And that pre-leasing really reduces the risk of all that development and it shortens the time period that it takes to get to those stabilized mid-teens returns. And so that's why you're seeing us tick up the investment there a bit.\nWe do evaluate some tier 2 markets in the US. You saw us buy a small data center in Miami, and we'll continue to look at whether there are sort of tuck-ins that we might want to do in the US if we have an anchor tenant that's going to give us a good return going into it and if we think it can turn into a more material campus for us later on, but it's not a huge priority for us.\nYou're not going to see us put a lot of capital into that. With respect to international expansion in data centers, that's not something we're leaning into at this point. We do have customers that would love for us to have a larger footprint than we do today, and we'll consider those opportunities.\nBut there's nothing that I would point to today to say that we're going to do anything outside the US in the near term.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey Simon, maybe I would complement Steve's comments on Nigeria just briefly here, but just as a reminder, I know you know this, but for others in Nigeria we also look to protect ourselves and the contract structures that Steve mentioned. So just as a reminder, we've got about $400 million in revenue, property revenue in Nigeria, 40% of that is actually pass-through, much of that is power, which is pegged to US pricing.\nSo we avoid the FX risk on those pass-through numbers. 60% of that $400 million roughly is the leasing revenue and 50% of that adjusts annually pegged to the US dollar. So again that's protected or sheltered from the FX volatility. That leaves about 30% of the revenue in Nigeria that's actually directly exposed to the FX fluctuations. And then with that said, of course we build the Fisher effect into our models.\nWe look for risk-adjusted rates of returns. Although in the short term FX can be volatile, we do think our underwriting process catches the FX volatility that would be in a market like Nigeria and others over the long term.\n\nSimon Flannery\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. Good morning and congrats again, Steve, on the official transition. Two topics for you this morning. First, can you share an update on the domestic leasing environment as to whether or not you're seeing any changes in the activity levels early this year?\nAnd can you share some of the data points and developments that are contributing to the decision to include improving carrier activity during the second half within your services guidance? And then just a second topic. What is the roadmap for the Latam portfolio to normalize its level of organic growth? How long does it take to get there? And what is that level of organic growth that AMT can return to? Thanks.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nThanks Michael. Thanks for the well wishes there. So I'll start with your first question about the US. So we are predicting our guidance for OTBG in the US is approximately 4.7%. And as you know, that's underwritten largely by our comprehensive MLAs that we have with our carriers. So we have a degree of insulation from the variability that you see in the deployment cadence there.\nWe do have one of our big three carrier MLAs that has rolled off of its comprehensive portion of that MLA, and so that's gone to a little bit more of an a la carte. So you'll see that activity spread more throughout the year than front end loaded like it would have been in a comprehensive agreement. What we're seeing from the carriers in the US is we are seeing an uptick in the conversations around activity.\nWe've seen a modest increase in application levels already this year. That's off a pretty low base at the end of last year, but we are seeing some increase in activity. But before we get the applications, there's a degree of conversation and inquiry that happens with our carriers. And especially with respect to our services business, we have a lot of conversation around that.\nAnd we're engaged on the front end of the process when they're doing their RF design sheets and trying to figure out what they're going to do for the year. And that's what's led us to believe that there's an uptick in activity, probably back end loaded. And that's led to our increasing our guidance in our services.\nBusiness for next year. Now, I would point out that if you look at our services guide, it's a little bit lower margin than previously. That's a result of having a little bit more construction services in that guide. And I do want to point out with our construction business, that's something that we've not grown aggressively over the past. And when you think about that services business, we don't do that nationwide.\nWe do it in pockets where we have the right resources and can lean on third party contractors to do the work so that if there are variabilities in the demand that we see there, that we can cut our costs pretty quickly there. So that's one of the things you're seeing reflected in that services margin is a higher mix of construction services. But again, that's targeted by region, by carrier.\nIt's not a huge business for us, but it's one that we think adds value to our customers and it earns us a little bit more business.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah, Michael, I'll hit the LatAm question on the organic tenant billings. So let me just kind of recap a little bit where we're at. Our guide for 2024 is about 2% organic tenant billings growth. That comes with a pretty steady colocation and amendment level of activity of around 3%. We also are benefiting from the escalators that are tied to local inflation across the region.\nThat's at about 4%. So you have that gross growth coming in in the upper single digits, 7%. We do also have 5% churn in for 2024. We've had a couple of churn events that we've worked through in Latin America over the last couple of years. Noticeably in 2023, we worked through the Telefónica churn down in Mexico. I think you're well aware of that.\nOne of the primary drivers of the churn in 2024 is the OI churn in Brazil. So of that 5% churn, almost half of it is the OI churn that we're assuming is going to come through in 2024. That's about $26 million of tenant billings for OI that ends up coming off in 2024. So we look at the market there and yes, we've gone through some consolidation churn and that churn is really what's been reducing our overall organic tenant billings growth rate.\nWe do expect to get through that churn and return to more normalized growth in the mid to upper mid single digits. But it's probably going to be a few years away before we get through that and the event. Not that I want to talk too much about 2025 and beyond, but the OI churn will persist for a couple of more years.\nThat's the one sort of to watch and to see how it rolls through. But once we get through that, we're, you know, we do see a good steady level of colocation amendment activity in the way our contracts are written. We do benefit, our benefit from the escalations tied to inflation. We protect ourselves from some FX volatility as well.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could, first, maybe just Steve. I think the biggest question I'm getting is that what we're hearing from American Tower about maybe a better second half of visibility into higher activity levels into the second half of the year is different than maybe what we heard yesterday from one of your peers, which is that the year is going to be more front end loaded, that the back part of the year could be slower, that the jumping off point for 2024 into 2025 might be slower. So could you kind of maybe talk a little bit about your conviction level that the second half activity levels can be higher? Maybe some of the differences between some of the MLAs you might have that others don't have such relationships, et cetera.\nThat would be very helpful, I think, for people to kind of reconcile what we're hearing in the last couple days. And then the second question, Rod, thank you for all the details around India. I think some people, I think, were surprised to see India in the full year guide, and people are trying to back out that Q4 in the back part of the year. Slide 20, you have an unlevered number that gets you to around $0.15 to 0.16 per share. But in the text you've got a number that you're pulling out for about $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter. Could you help us understand the difference between the unlevered and the levered numbers, in order to kind of get a level set for what we are really thinking will be the guide for 2024 AFFO per share. Thank you.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nOkay, I'll start with the first question. We're talking about the US growth. So I would just point out that as a result of our comprehensive MLAs, that our revenue is decoupled from the levels of activity to some extent. So I think comparing us to someone else's estimations of leasing new business is a little bit tough, just given the fact that we have a level of locked in activity and a large part of our rental growth is, it's locked in.\nIt's either signed because it was signed last year, it's commencing this year, it's part of our comprehensive MLAs, or there's a degree of carryover revenue in the OTBG number that carries forward because it's a truly 12 months metric there.\nThe better analog for activity is our services business. And as we've said in the past, it's notoriously hard to predict exactly where you're going to land. A couple of years ago we had to take guidance up quite a bit. Last year we brought it down. So what we're providing is our best estimate given the levels of activity we're seeing. But also some of it can be more market driven.\nSo it may be activity in a particular market versus more ubiquitous activity. Given that that's how we're performing some of that services work, we do see a general uptick in conversation from our customers that make us believe that there will be an uptick in the second half of the year.\nBut as you think about that activity and the services levels of the service business for that activity, you have to do quite a bit of services work before you actually sign a new lease. If you're kind of in an a la carte environment, so it could just be timing that we're referencing there.\nBut at the end of the day, you know, our belief is, you know, our property revenue growth or rental growth is largely locked up in, and we feel confident in the portion that's not locked in, that that'll come through in the cadence we believe. And on the services side, we believe that we'll see a continuing ramp in that activity. And that's what led to the guide on that.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, David, Rod here. Regarding India, just a couple of points there. So you see in page 20, we give you the breakdown for India, not just for the full year but also on a quarterly basis. So that to really help you figure out kind of what the impact may be.\nUp against a variety of closing dates, right. We expect the transaction to close in H2 2024. The process that we're going through is it's being reviewed by the Competition Commission of India. So that's kind of the gating.\nThe gating action there. Of course, we reviewed kind of that process with local, with our local team, with local advisors, lawyers in India, India-based lawyers in the US as well as, you know, doing the proper diligence around interested parties within India. We feel pretty good about that approval process. With all that said, we do expect it to be approved and closed in H2 2024, but we're not exactly sure what the date would be.\nSo we wanted to give you the quarterly breakdown so that as we progress through the year, you'd have the ability to kind of look at it quarter by quarter on a full year. We've got property revenue from India at about one point, just under $1.2 billion, Adjusted EBITDA at about $360 million, and unlevered AFFO at $285 million.\nAnd again, you can see the way that breaks down per quarter. Essentially, the difference between that unlevered AFFO and what we look at is the potential dilution of $0.30 to 0.40 for the year, maybe $0.09. Dilution on a quarterly basis is the assumption that we would take the proceeds from the sale, roughly $2 to 2.5 billion, and pay down revolving debt. That is in the.\nNot that I want to give you the guide in terms of our interest rate, but you can kind of know where revolving debt is these days for us, up in the 6% range or so approximately. You know, you put those proceeds towards paying down that debt, and that's the differential that brings that dilution down into the $0.09 per quarter, or between $0.30 and 0.40 for the year. The math is really that simple. David.\n\nDavid Barden\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nPerfect. That's really helpful, guys. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve, appreciate you giving us your view and the refinement and the raising, the capital allocation. Very good details.\nThe first question I've got is Rod piggybacking on David's question about India. There is obviously some concentration there at Brookfield as far as how many towers they have in the marketplace. Have you heard anything from the Competition Commission there about their comfort level or would there be any required divestitures?\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nYeah, Rick, thanks for the question. So we're, you know, we're working through the process. I don't want to get into detailed discussions. We certainly haven't talked directly to the Competition Commission, but we've certainly done a fair amount of diligence. We're not sure where that will end up. We're pretty confident, very confident it gets approved. There could be some level of divestitures that was contemplated within the agreement that we worked through.\nSo nothing there that would concern us overly. And the other part is where Brookfield does have some towers. The way they plan to run these also is competition friendly, I would say, is the way that we kind of, we view it there. I don't want to go into more detail than that, but we do expect that the transaction would be approved and would have the ability to close it in H2 2024.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nOkay. And then, Steve, appreciate the comments that you decouple service revenue really from leasing revenue because of the MOAs versus others. Is it still kind of three, six months from the prime? You're getting applications, having these two talks before it shows up in the financials. And then can you give us a little color kind of then on the pacing you expect of that. I think Roger said 180 to 190 million of new leasing activity in US Canada.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. It's hard to give an exact timeline, Ric, because it's different by different customers. So I would say from application to revenue showing up on an a la carte basis, there's a variability there from call it 60 days to six months, kind of what you referred to there. It really depends on the customer and how urgent they are to get on the site, to be honest with you.\nIn terms of the cadence for the contribution from the new leases and colocations, it's relatively flat across the period. Again, I just would point out that we had the comprehensive portion of one of our major MLAs expired at the end of last year. So that got rid of some of the front end loading that you saw in previous years. So it'll be more evenly distributed this year.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nOkay. The last one, Rod just pointed out that there's a probability that the dividend could go down from the $1.70 paid in Q4 to what would be paid evenly spread over 2024, maybe a $1.62 while keeping it fairly flat, 2024 versus 2023 annually. Help people understand what was the thought process on why raise the dividend? Because we get this question a lot. Why raise the dividend so much in Q4 2023 if you have to pull it optically down in Q1 2024 while keeping it flat for the year.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nYeah. Hey, Ric, I'll take that one. Look, we didn't take the decision to hold the dividend flat lightly on that, and we were aware of. The optics problem with a step down from Q4 to Q1, but we had committed to our shareholders to a certain dividend in 2023. When we decided to hold it flat in 2024, if we didn't have the step up in Q4, then we wouldn't have hit the number that we had committed to.\nAnd so we like to do what we say we're going to do. And that's the reason we kept it there. We think this has been very well telegraphed. We're trying to be very clear on our Q3 call about what was happening, and we've talked about it since then, and this is a one-time event. And so, you know, it's agreed that it's not the ideal situation, but we wanted to do what we say we're going to do and hold the dividend flat.\n\nRic Prentiss\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nWe always like executives doing what they say they're going to do. And I do think going spread evenly through the years is probably good as well. So thanks, guys. And again, Steve, appreciate all the color. It was very insightful about how you're sitting in the seat and running the company. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Luebchow\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "I appreciate the question, Steve. So you made it pretty clear, you know, deleveraging investing and kind of more developed markets this year as a top priority. So maybe you could talk about the M and A environment right now as a potential use of capital. I know there are some consolidation opportunities out there in Europe. Just wondering if that's an area of expansion for you over time and then one for Rod. I think you've talked aspirationally about getting to kind of a double-digit AFFO growth rate. Maybe you could just kind of update us longer term with the impact of refinancings in the coming years. The India transaction, where do you think you can get to when stripping out some of the noise from India and some of the changes in interest rates that we've seen recently. Thank you.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nI'll start talking about the M&A environment. We continue to monitor what's going on in the M&A activity across the portfolio. We're still seeing a dislocation between public and private multiples. And so there's no portfolio out there today that's trading that we think is strategically important that would meet our investment criteria. And that's one of the reasons that we're a little bit out of that market right now.\nOne of the reasons that we're very focused on bringing our leverage down to the high end of our target range is to make sure that we're in a position to take advantage of inorganic opportunities when and if they come to market that we think are strategically important, but also that meet our investment criteria. So we're optimistic that there will be portfolios in the future that are something that we would be interested in. But right now there's just nothing that I would point to that we think is trading in a range that we would find compelling.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey Eric, Rod here. Thanks for the question. So, regarding AFFO growth, let me just hit a couple of points. First, I'll just hit kind of generically what we look at as kind of a growth algorithm for the portfolio. And as Steve said, we're really pleased with the portfolio that we have. The diversity that we have throughout developed markets as well as exposure to emerging markets.\nI would remind you and everyone that in those emerging markets, those are some of the largest populated countries in the world that need more and more infrastructure over time. And we do think having exposure to that is going to be really good for us and our investors in this growth algorithm. But the algorithm is really pretty straightforward. We look at roughly 5% organic growth from the US that includes some Sprint churn over the next few years there.\nWe do expect that the non US properties will have incremental growth from there, maybe a couple hundred basis points. We think that's possible certainly from Africa and Latin America over time, maybe not every year, but on average over a long period of time we expect to be there. We're looking at upper single digit double digit growth rates from CoreSite with very nice return.\nSo that looks very good. Of course as you move down the P and L, you end up with higher growth rates at gross margin, at EBITDA margin. Particularly with our focus on cost discipline, reducing costs, managing costs, both direct costs as well as SG&A in driving expanded margin. So by the time you get down to AFFO, you know, does that 5% US.\ngrowth, 7% international double-digit core site; all that can translate into upper single-digit AFFO growth pretty nicely. That's kind of what we look at. Then if you just look at 2023 and 2024, in 2023 we come in AFFO per share growth at around 1% or so. I'll just remind you that included 7% headwind from financing in the year. It included an additional 100 basis points headwind for the VIL reserve, and maybe a full percentage point for fx.\nIf you kind of do the math backwards, that core underlying business is solidly upper single-digit growth rate. In 2024 the guide is around 5%, getting us to that 10%, $10.33 per share. Financing headwinds in that is about 100 basis points. We have the reserve, broadly speaking, for India, and that's about 100 basis points headwind as well.\nWith the FX volatility that we're seeing, that's about a 200 basis point headwind. So again, you back up into that and you're getting into that upper single digit kind of core growth. And I'll remind you that even that upper single digit core growth has embedded in it higher than normal churn in some of the emerging markets, as well as the Sprint churn in the US, as we go through that. Being able to handle some modest FX and even financing items with churn being at a more normal level, certainly in the upper single digit growth rates on AFFO and AFFO per share, is in our line of sight.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBatya Levi\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations for Europe in terms of new leasing revenue growth beyond this year and how you think about your scale in the region? And I think there was a bit of a write-down in Spain. Can you talk about what drove that? Thank you.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nI'll start with some leasing trends, Rod, and you can pick it up. So what we're seeing in Europe is we continue to see build outs by the carriers, and we do see substantial 5G population coverage from the leading M&Os in Germany and Spain. So the pipeline of growth that we see remains solid, but it's more weighted toward colocations in Germany.\nWe are continuing to work through some of the market complexities that everyone's dealing with there, including some permitting delays, and time for power connections. But we do feel good about the progress we've made there. We've brought in resources from other parts of our company to help with that and kind of utilizing best practices. So we do expect some improvement in our timelines there. So that's what we would expect to continue to see in Europe: a little bit more colocation-driven activity as they're through the bulk of their 5G upgrades in most of our markets.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey Batya, Rod here. So regarding Spain, you obviously saw that we had a write-down in our Spain market of about $80 million that is exclusively rate driven based on a cost of capital as a function of our annual impairment testing. I would also add to that that the Spain market is performing very well in terms of hitting its metrics and milestones up against our original business case.\nI'd also remind you that the Spain business was really the only business in Europe that is 100% from the Telxius acquisition. There was no legacy business there prior to that transaction. But simply put, the impairment of about $80 million was exclusively a function of rising cost of capital running through a discounted cash flow impairment model.\n\nOperator\n\nGot it. Thank you.\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking the questions. Just one on data centers and one housekeeping, first on data centers. How are the nature of conversations with your customers changing or evolving, if at all, as AI use cases become a little bit more pervasive across enterprises?\nAnd I'm really getting at, do you sense that that sort of edge data center build that maybe was part of the CoreSite acquisition, maybe rationale, at least initially, the micro data centers at the base of your towers, is that becoming something that's a little bit more near term or is that more still of a long term opportunity? And then maybe for Rod on D&A, what's driving the review and the decision to potentially extend the useful lives of the tower assets? I saw a pretty big step down implied in D&A in your guide for this year. Thanks.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSo I'll start with the data center question. In general with CoreSite, what we're seeing is demand is still largely driven by enterprises moving to a hybrid cloud environment, and that's people who were either cloud native or primarily cloud, or they were still in their on-prem facility. That's still a major driver. We are seeing AI influence pick up in our facilities. We've always had some AI applications that were targeting our facilities, so we are seeing demand there.\nMore broadly speaking, AI is reducing overall capacity in the markets or overall supply of the markets, which is leading to some favorable pricing trends for us. When it comes to the edge deployment, we do think that AI inferencing and protection and the interface people have with AI will lead to opportunities there. Right now the near-term opportunities that we're exploring are more niche markets.\nYou may have seen one of our partners put out a blog that we're working with them on an edge facility kind of in the automotive market to update software on their products. We have a number of POCs that we're working on with various partners that are more niche applications. In particular, I think the micro data centers at the base of the towers facilitating AI is still a bit further out, and we'll continue to update you guys if there's something to talk about there. But in the meantime, we just continue to work with our customers, our potential customers, on iterating on what that's going to look like.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey Matt, regarding the tower life adjustment that you saw running through our numbers here, we essentially increased the tower life from 20 years to 30 years for book purposes for our GAAP books. That was, you know, simply put, it's just a function of matching up the, you know, the book life here more closely with what the actual realized life is for the assets. So nothing really more complicated than that other than a realization that these assets last a lot longer than 20 years. Our books will not reflect that going forward.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question today comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Nispel\n\nEquity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHey, thank you for taking the question. When we look at the capital spending for the data center segment in your development pipeline, does that imply capital expense spending expansion beyond 2024? Really? How does that inform your decision on spending around your remaining businesses in your power segments?Thanks.\n\nSteven Vondran\n\nPresident and CEO, American Tower\n\nSure. Well, the record amount of sales that we've had is what's led to us increasing the development pipeline there. It really depends on what our sales are this year and how we continue to see the opportunities in that portfolio evolve as to what the future spending are. So it would be premature for me to kind of guide future years capital there.\nWhat I would reinforce is that we have a degree of optionality in our capital spending and that we do have a structure with CoreSite where we also have partners in that business. So there is some optionality in terms of how much capital we put in and you could see us using our capital or someone else's capital to expand if we thought that was a better option for us.\nAt this point the development pipeline we have today, we're choosing to self-fund because we're achieving mid-teen stabilized returns, very low risk in our existing campuses, and we continue to see demand rise. We'll make that assessment into what's appropriate for 2017 and later, a little bit later. We'll share that with you guys at the appropriate time.\n\nRod Smith\n\nEVP, CFO, and Treasurer, American Tower\n\nHey, Brandon. Rod here. The only thing I would add to Steve's comments there is that, you know, we have full optionality kind of going forward. I think Steve alluded to this. But going beyond 2024, the fact that we're investing $450 million in the data center business in 2024 does not commit us to that level or a higher level of capital spending in that business going forward.\nSo we have a fair amount of flexibility to deploy capital towards towers, towards data centers, towards towers in developed markets, emerging markets, certain countries, not other countries as we go year to year. So we will be looking to secure that optionality, protect that optionality, so we can always make decisions with our capital we that follow the best risk adjusted rates of return around the globe for any given year.\n\nBrandon Nispel\n\nEquity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, American Tower\n\nThank you everybody for joining today's call. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to reach out to the investor relations team. Thank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the American Tower Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Barlett, our President and CEO, will discuss current technology trends and how our distributed portfolio of assets is positioned to benefit from ongoing wireless technology evolution.\nAnd then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q3 2023 results and revised full year outlook. We are also joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our current Executive Vice President and President of our U.S. tower division, who, as announced this morning, will assume the role of Global Chief Operating Officer effective November 1, before assuming the role of our President and Chief Executive Officer on February 1, 2024.\nAfter these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nSuch factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Tower Corp.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. And my focus for today's call will be on the technology trends and network investments that drive demand for our leading tower and data center platforms as well as the developments we're seeing at the edge. While my comments will largely be focused on the 5G evolution and the progress we're seeing in the United States, we believe similar trends will prevail across our international footprint as they have historically. Beginning with our macro tower business, the fundamental factor that drives demand for our global power portfolio, growth in mobile data consumption continues unabated.\nThis is true both in the United States and across the globe, where mobile network data traffic has almost doubled over the last 2 years alone to a staggering 126 exabytes per month. Looking out over the next 5 years, forecasted growth in data traffic per device remains compelling as more spectrum for 5G networks will be deployed at scale.\nAverage monthly data usage per smartphone across our key developed markets like the U.S., Germany and Spain is expected to grow at a healthy compounded annual rate of 18% between 2023 and 2028. And I would note that these estimates have been somewhat conservative historically. So let's spend a moment on where we are in the 5G investment cycle in the U.S. and where we believe we're going over the next several years.\nJust as we saw with the 3G and 4G rollouts, we expect the 5G investment cycle to play out in 3 phases that represent discrete business cases for the carriers and these 3 phases will drive 2 peak periods of spend that are bridged by a temporary phase of more moderate activity. The first phase is coverage-driven and aimed at upgrading existing infrastructure with new spectrum bands and radio technology, its competition to provide broad nationwide coverage with the new G ramps up.\nAt the same time, carriers are looking to realize the efficiency benefits of their investments in new software, hardware and upgraded user devices. Initial equipment upgrades and new spectrum deployment quickly deliver reduced cost per gigabyte resulting in the ability to maintain margin profiles.\nAbsent this migration, any incremental investments in the prior generation would be expected to result in significantly diminished returns as the additional densification required to sustain increasing network traffic on existing spectrum bands would be cost prohibitive. As the cadence of initial coverage investments begin to moderate from record spend of over $40 billion in 2022, the first peak of the 5G cycle, we retain a high degree of conviction that there's a long tail of network investment to come.\nThis belief is predicated on several factors, including our experience with past investment cycles, industry forecast for growth in mobile data consumption that apply a necessity for significant incremental coverage and capacity and the visibility into network needs, we get through our contract structures. Today, Phase 1 of the 5G rollout is winding down, and we're heading into a second phase.\nWe expect Phase 2 to be characterized by carriers beginning to harvest the network efficiency benefits of their initial investments while moderating spend from the record levels of 2022 to roughly $35 billion in 2023, which is $5 billion in excess of 4G averages, representing the second highest level of annual spend on record. In this next phase, we will begin to see a seeping in of 5G technology across the wireless and enterprise landscape.\nFor example, 5G smartphone penetration has now surpassed the 50% mark in North America, which will ultimately allow for the majority of network traffic to shift over to 5G networks which we expect to occur in the 2025 time frame. We're also looking forward to the emergence of more ubiquitous accessibility of stand-alone 5G core networks, which will unlock improved 5G network quality, higher speeds and lower latency and provide a platform for the development of innovative services and consumer applications.\nFinally, we anticipate that the arrival of end-to-end 5G capabilities will facilitate additional monetization opportunities at the enterprise level through use cases like private networks, network slicing and other IoT services that are beginning to emerge today. Ultimately, these dynamics will culminate in a third capacity-focused phase aimed at significant densification of 5G networks.\nWe continue to believe that 5G will advance and enable the next generation of mass market consumer use cases, particularly once 3GPP-released 17 and 18 are in the market, coupled with 5G cores that provide the true benefits of the end-to-end technology upgrade at scale.\nThat said, meeting industry forecasts for growth in mobile data consumption that will drive the need for substantial network capacity investments seems highly achievable when taking into account the technology we have at our fingertips today. In fact, industry estimates already show that 5G subscribers are consuming 2 to 3x more mobile data than the average 4G subscriber.\nSo let's take the case of mobile video consumption, which has consistently shown to be a dominant use case across subscriber usage types. As you can see on Slide 6, Today, the average smartphone subscriber in North America utilizes roughly 21 gigabytes of mobile data per month, and this is expected to grow to about 48 gigabytes by 2028.\nOf the 21 gigabytes consumed today, the majority or approximately 19 gigabytes are attributed to video streaming, which corresponds to a little over an hour of daily video usage and 360 and 480 pixel videos currently make up around half of that time. So by simply assuming a modest level of incremental usage towards higher resolution streaming such as 8 minutes of 4K Ultra HD, we would see video consumption alone drive usage to the forecasted 48 gigabytes per month or approximately 2.3x the current rate.\nFurthermore, the data already shows that 5G is driving increased usage of higher resolution video formats. A recent report from Ericsson found that since 2021, 5G users report a nearly 50% increase in time spent on enhanced video formats. For example, among that user base, usage of new video formats like 360-degree videos and multi-view streaming have increased by an average of 10 minutes and 15 minutes per day, respectively, while time spent streaming videos and standard resolution has decreased by 23 minutes over the same period.\nIn short, we've already seen 5G adoption linked with a shift in behavior towards using more data-intensive applications, a trend we firmly believe will continue going forward. And while we remain confident that new low-latency, high-bandwidth consumer applications will be born as 5G stand-alone networks are deployed at scale, we see a highly tangible case for densification requirements from where we stand today.\nWith that, I'll briefly provide an update on CoreSite in our data center segment before shifting to the progress we're making at the edge. The case remains that demand in CoreSite's interconnection-centric business is exceeding our initial expectations. Our teams delivered record signed new business in 2022, a record we are targeting to exceed in 2023.\nWe've also seen consistent elevated growth in interconnection revenue, mark-to-market pricing increases that exceed our historical averages, low churn and ongoing performance that we believe positions us to deliver compelling results in the segment for many years to come. And much like we see in our tower business, the secular trends that underpin the business model like the migration of workloads from on-prem to hybrid multi-cloud environments and the emergence of AI use cases that will drive more demand in our ecosystem continue on a path toward long-term acceleration.\nFor example, findings from our recent 2023 state of the data center report showed that 94% of IT leaders noted that native direct connection between colocation data centers, major cloud providers, which CoreSite provides is essential for improved performance, enhanced security, cost savings and hybrid cloud connectivity.\nFurther, 92% of IT leaders are considering moving critical workloads from public cloud to colocation to accelerate revenue growth and support the increasing need for AI and machine learning applications. In this context, we continue to upgrade our offerings and capabilities within the business to support emerging use cases.\nFor example, earlier this month, we launched new capabilities on our OCX, our pioneering software-defined networking platform, enabling clients to rapidly create higher bandwidth virtual connections to Google Cloud and AWS Direct Connect and between CoreSite data centers, including 50 gigabit services. These upgrades reduce the time required for organizations to augment network capacity to support high-bandwidth, low-latency hybrid applications like AI, machine learning and digital media production.\nWhen it comes to current and future AI and machine learning applications, CoreSite's flexible, purpose-built design data centers position us to host power-intensive GPU services being used for AI and ML use cases. For example, we're already providing GPU capacity for applications like 3D visualization and rendering and for software development with a niche cloud environment.\n[Audio Gap]\nFacilities are designed to accommodate liquid cooling with modest development efforts when required. As we've stated previously, in the near term, we continue to believe the majority of today's generative AI workloads will provide hyperscale opportunities that don't meet our investment criteria or fit within the CoreSite ecosystem.\nHowever, as GEN AI evolves, we would expect the balance of workloads to shift from large language model development, intensive training and public prompts to specialized inference-based use cases as productivity gains from the deployment of custom models accelerates. At this stage, when low latency interconnection high-power density and distributed high-performance compute become the priorities, we believe CoreSite and ultimately, our distributed portfolio of franchise real estate assets across the U.S. are going to be optimally positioned to benefit.\nOn that note, we've continued to see progress toward the realization of demand cases that support our initial edge thesis, and we believe we have an opportunity to enable a more efficient exchange of network traffic and support cloud services and peering in a more distributed manner. As a result, we've been working both internally and with external stakeholders to develop an edge model we can execute on as compelling opportunities present themselves.\nIn our initial assumption that through CoreSite, our seat at the table and visibility into the customer demand environment would be materially enhanced is holding true. We're increasingly seeing interest from potential customers looking to extend technologies such as private cloud computing, AI and 5G applications closer to the end device through a more distributed architecture. This is resulting from several key ability of future power requirements, business efficiency, revenue generation opportunities and customer experience.\nWhen it comes to power, CoreSite has secured significant future power availability and is insulated from expected shortages in markets like Northern Virginia. However, power constraints in general are increasingly in focus in legacy data center markets. In this case, we believe our distributed land footprint in Tier 2 and 3 markets with significant power availability and capability to connect back to CoreSite campuses can serve more distributed power capacity needs while enabling customers to enjoy the interconnection benefits of the CoreSite ecosystem.\nAnd as its potential customers increasingly focus on new revenue opportunities and customer experience including through the proliferation of applications like next-generation gaming, AR and devices and wearables that leverage interactive AI, we believe we have a compelling combination of distributed points of presence and interconnection capabilities. We see an opportunity to drive a significant time to market advantage and reduce overall development costs which could be compelling to customers and enhance returns on investment.\nAs a result of these factors, we continue to work towards establishing a repeatable, rapidly deployable design with initial capacity in the 1 megawatt range, which could then be scalable to incremental megawatts with interconnection to multisite campuses and dictates. As always, we'll assess potential growth at the edge through the prism of our disciplined capital allocation framework committing capital only if the opportunity meets our investment criteria and aligns with our long-term strategic vision of growing our interconnection ecosystem in a way that maximizes shareholder value.\nIn closing, the bottom line is that we remain at the relatively early stages of a 5G and network technology evolution that we believe will necessitate continuous incremental investment in existing infrastructure like towers, data centers and distributed edge infrastructure. We also believe that ongoing technology developments will unlock new capabilities that will drive the next wave of innovative and data-intensive consumer and enterprise devices and applications.\nAnd American Tower, with its leading tower portfolio and real estate footprint combined with a highly interconnected data center ecosystem is in a truly differentiated position to serve the network infrastructure needs of the future. Before I hand the call over to Rod, I'd like to close my remarks by congratulating Steve Vondran, who effective November 1, will hold the role of Global Chief Operating Officer until February 1 of next year, at which point he'll transition to the position of Chief Executive Officer; and Bud Noel, who will become our new Executive Vice President and President of our U.S. tower division.\nThe Board and I have worked diligently on succession planning weighing the merits of an external search against the talent we have within our organization. Steve joined American Tower in 2000 and currently serves as the Executive Vice President of our U.S. and Canada business including bolt towers and data centers. For the past 23 years, Steve has been instrumental to the growth and sustainability of earnings from American Tower and has built tremendous credibility with our global organization his peers, the Board of Directors, the American Tower investor base and our customers.\nAll this to say, Steve is a clear candidate to lead American Tower in its next growth phase. And over the next several months, I'll work closely with Steve, the executive leadership team and the Board to ensure a seamless transition. Lastly, I want to thank all of the incredible American Tower employees around the world both past and present, our customers and investors for their support and confidence you've demonstrated since I joined in 2009. Although this is a difficult decision on my part, I look forward to the time ahead with family and friends and new challenges while watching the company under Steve's leadership, continue to succeed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to review our latest results and updated outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. In Q3, we continued our trend of strong performance, driven by solid demand for our diverse global portfolio of assets. Against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we remain focused on delivering results and creating value by driving organic growth across our existing portfolio and demonstrating global operational efficiency and cost management in support of attractive margin expansion.\nAt the same time, we are committed to strengthening our balance sheet by enhancing our liquidity extending our maturities, reducing floating rate debt volatility and making progress towards our leverage target. These efforts coupled with the evolving technological trends highlighted by Tom, remain key drivers of our current performance and give us confidence in our ability to drive sustained growth over the long term.\nBefore delving into the specifics of our Q3 results and raised outlook, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we saw a continuation of solid trends across our global operations, driving consolidated property revenue growth of 7%, consolidated organic tenant billings growth in our tower business exceeded 6% for the third consecutive quarter and was complemented by over 9% revenue growth in our data center business.\nAs a result of this strong performance and visibility extending through the end of 2023, we raised our full year expectations across nearly all segments, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Next, our keen focus on cost management resulted in conversion rates exceeding 100% and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 290 basis points year-over-year and still over 215 basis points when normalized for the prior year VIL revenue reserves, complementing our operational efforts.\nOn the balance sheet side, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of approximately 5.9% by utilizing the proceeds to pay down revolver balances, we reduced our floating rate debt exposure to approximately $4 billion or less than 11% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the third quarter down from over 22% at the start of the year. Finally, we're making significant progress on the strategic review of our India business.\nAs we are in the final stages of this process, we remain committed to communicating the outcome to our shareholders before the end of the year, consistent with our past messaging. In Q3, we recorded $322 million in goodwill impairment charges associated with our India business. This was prompted by indications of value obtained through the process conducted over the past several months. supported by our own interim goodwill impairment test. We believe this impairment accurately reflects the current market conditions, evolving risk premiums associated with operating in the India market and more generally increases in the cost of capital.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, consolidated property revenue growth was 7% or 8% on an FX-neutral basis. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was over 5%, which includes a nearly 2% headwind associated with a reduction in straight-line revenue, offset by timing benefits associated with certain nonrecurring onetime items in the quarter.\nInternational growth was nearly 9% or approximately 11%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations which included a 4% benefit associated with the full collection of VIL billings in India in the quarter as compared to the approximately $48 million revenue reserve in the prior year. Finally, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, our data center business revenue increased by over 9% and continues to demonstrate solid outperformance as compared to our initial underwriting plan.\nAs Tom mentioned earlier, we anticipate 2023 to again break the signed new business record just set in 2022, setting up CoreSite to drive sustained attractive levels of growth as the backlog of new business commences over the next several years. Moving to the right side of the slide. Strong performance across each of our segments drove consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%.\nWithin our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.3% and greater than 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of colocation and amendment contributions of nearly $60 million. Our International segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily driven by higher new business in Africa and churn delays in Latin America and APAC resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9%.\nTurning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 10% to $1.8 billion for the quarter or approximately 11% on an FX-neutral basis. As I highlighted in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 64.4% a 290 basis point improvement compared to the previous year, primarily driven by solid organic growth, effective cost management throughout the business and the onetime revenue items I mentioned. In fact, despite the current inflationary environment, we have managed to maintain a relatively flat year-over-year cash SG&A profile remaining consistent with the themes from the first half of the year, with cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue standing at approximately 6.5% for the quarter, a nearly 70 basis point improvement versus Q3 of 2022.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share each increased by over 9%, driven by solid cash adjusted EBITDA growth partially offset by an approximately 5% headwind from financing costs. Now shifting focus to our revised full year outlook. I'll start by highlighting a few key items.\nFirst, as a result of our strong performance in the third quarter and the momentum taking us through the end of the year, we've raised our guidance for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. Next, our revised outlook includes a reduction in U.S. services, resulting in a $20 million decrease in gross margin compared to our previous expectations for the year. As we've highlighted in the past, although quarter-to-quarter variations in tower leasing activity have impacted our services revenue in 2023, our leasing revenue remains unaffected, underpinned by the comprehensive master lease agreements currently in place.\nFinally, the updated midpoints include revised FX assumptions that have resulted in outlook to outlook headwinds of approximately $28 million for property revenue, $14 million for adjusted EBITDA and $5 million for attributable AFFO. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $60 million as compared to our prior outlook.\nOur revised expectations are driven by $31 million in core property revenue outperformance and along with approximately $45 million and $12 million in additional pass-through and straight-line revenues, respectively. Our revised guidance includes $10 million in outperformance associated with VIL collections with roughly half included in our core property revenue and the balance in the pass-through outperformance illustrated.\nGrowth was partially offset by $28 million of negative FX impacts. Turning to Slide 11. We are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth across nearly all segments. In the U.S. and Canada, we are increasing our guidance to greater than 5% or approximately 6.5% excluding Sprint churn, now with an expectation for approximately $230 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. Growth is further benefiting from non-Sprint related churn delays, which we now anticipate occurring in 2024.\nIn Latin America, we have increased our outlook from approximately 4% up now to approximately 5%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from greater than 11% to approximately 12%, primarily due to a continued uptick in colocation and amendment demand.\nIn APAC, we are increasing our guidance from approximately 4% to about 5% supported by a combination of strong new business in delayed churn. Moving on to Slide 12. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $60 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue highlighted earlier, coupled with prudent cost controls, resulting in an incremental $67 million in cash property gross margin outperformance along with an additional $14 million in cash, SG&A savings and $30 million of straight line.\nThis growth was partially offset by a reduction of $20 million associated with our U.S. services business, and a negative FX impact of $14 million. Turning to Slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint or approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.79 per share.\nOur performance was driven by the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $61 million partially offset by $16 million of other items, including an acceleration of certain maintenance projects in cash taxes, along with incremental minority interest due to outperformance in our JV businesses, partially offset by improvements to net interest.\nAs I noted earlier, FX caused a headwind of approximately $5 million. Moving on to Slide 14. Let's review our capital allocation plans for the full year. Consistent with the expectations set at the beginning of the year, we are planning to distribute approximately $3 billion in common stock dividends which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 10% on a per share basis, subject to board approval.\nOur full year CapEx spend also remains consistent at $1.7 billion with the acceleration of certain nondiscretionary projects that I mentioned earlier, offset by lower discretionary spend, which includes a reduction in development CapEx associated with lower anticipated new build volumes. As always, our goal is to execute a capital deployment strategy that maximizes total shareholder returns.\nIn line with my earlier remarks, we're focused on creating incremental value through solid organic growth and quality of earnings optimizing global operational efficiency and expanding cash margins, all while strengthening our financial position by further reducing balance sheet risk and enhancing financial flexibility.\nAs it relates to capital allocation and against the current economic backdrop, we believe it's optimal to prioritize balance sheet strength and keep discretionary spend focused on select capital expenditure projects that yield the best risk-adjusted returns and quality of earnings. Additionally, decoupled from our current line of sight to its attributable AFFO growth for next year, we anticipate maintaining a dividend per share profile in 2024 that closely aligns with our 2023 expectation of $6.45 per share resuming growth in a manner supportive of our REIT taxable income thereafter, all subject to Board approval.\nBy focusing on the above priorities, we believe American Tower is positioned for sustained and compelling total shareholder returns supported through balance sheet strength over the long term. Consistent with our historical practice, we'll discuss our 2024 plans in more detail on our next earnings call.\nMoving to the right side of the slide and as highlighted earlier, as a result of the successful execution of our financing initiatives in the third quarter, we reduced our floating rate debt balance to below 11%, increased our liquidity to $9.7 billion, and our average maturity remains over 6 years. We closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5x, which benefits from certain nonrecurring items in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect to close the year slightly above 5x.\nMoving forward, we'll remain opportunistic and potentially further accessing the debt capital markets, ensuring continued strength in our balance sheet, reducing risk and enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 15 and in summary, our diverse portfolio of global communications assets continue to demonstrate resiliency in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, producing attractive growth through organic leasing further amplified by exceptional cost management at the margin. Complementing our operational performance, we continue to make progress in strengthening and derisking our balance sheet.\nFurthermore, we remain committed to managing our capital structure, sources and uses and capital allocation priorities in a manner that positions American Tower to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.",

Welcome to the American Tower Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Tower Corp.\n\nThanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining this morning's call. Consistent with our past practice, my comments today will focus on our international segment, which consists of a well-diversified high-growth portfolio of assets across key developed in emerging geographies outside of the United States. Before diving into our international operations, though, and in light of the recent excitement surrounding the potential arising from AI workloads, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting the demand we're seeing in our CoreSite data center business, where we've seen 9% year-over-year growth in both revenue and operating profit through the first 6 months of the year.\nFollowing record levels of signed new business in 2022 and Q1 of '23, we continue to see demand for data centers outstripping supply and our initial underwriting expectations elevated pre-leasing in a pipeline that points to an extended opportunity for increasingly profitable growth. Each of these factors is contributing to strong pricing trends and the ability to be selective in terms of signing new logos and expansions from existing customers, ensuring accretion to the value of the interconnection ecosystem and overall AFFO growth, particularly once we begin commencing the remainder of the record new business we've signed over the last 1.5 years. This is all before factoring in expectations for elevated demand from AI use cases. While much of the immediate demand in the market today is coming from hyperscale requirements, the longer-term opportunity for interconnection hub like CoreSite is just as significant and is arising from several key demand drivers.\nFirst, we've already seen an acceleration in outsourcing to CoreSite is hybrid IT and multi-cloud access are becoming more relevant for continued digital transformation across all workloads. As enterprises increasingly leverage new generative AI models for business and customer applications, they'll need to deploy servers that require more power and cooling than on-premises data centers can typically handle. At the same time, we expect existing enterprise customers who are building AI into their products and operating models will expand their power and space reforms in Coresight, with its flexible and scalable model and speed to market benefits is already well positioned to support these expected use cases today. Second, we're seeing today's cloud-enabled large language models requiring connections to proprietary distributed data sets, used for training which CoreSite as an interconnection ecosystem with a nationwide distribution of cloud on-ramps is well situated to serve.\nAnd finally, we see a significant incremental opportunity arising from the use of hybrid and custom large language models for training and inferencing or low latency, high power density and distributed high-performance compute is expected to result in elevated activity across our existing CoreSite campus footprint. Over time, we see potential for these dynamic requirements to push demand for a more distributed compute infrastructure, for which our CoreSite portfolio and ultimately our distributed footprint of land parcels on new tower sites may be ideal locations over the long term. Simply put, the ongoing demand trends in the data center space and the emergence of generative AI use cases are providing American Tower through CoreSite an opportunity to play a central role as an infrastructure provider against a backdrop of technology evolution that's expected to drive a step-up function increase in computing power demand.\nAs a result, we see a compelling opportunity to continue delivering industry-leading yields on invested capital that CoreSite has historically achieved, which Rob will touch on more later. With that, let's turn to our international tower business, where our objectives have remained clear since we began expansion over 2 decades ago, leverage our proven capabilities and expertise to selectively invest in the world's largest free market democracies with regulatory structures that are supportive of the neutral host tower model, healthy competitive wireless industries and high-quality assets and counterparties. At the same time, we focused on investing in markets that are in various stages of network technology development and where we see a path to establishing nationwide scale. By bringing these factors together, we believe we can both augment and extend our growth trajectory, leverage our platform and expertise to create incremental value in selected markets and add to an already compelling total return profile for American Tower shareholders.\nAs a critical component of this portfolio management and capital allocation program, we measure and analyze our assets on an ongoing basis to ensure the merit is identified and our initial investment underwriting remained consistent today. As you've seen recently, such evaluation has led to select divestitures including our Mexico fiber business and operations in Poland and a strategic review of our India business. The takeaways from these analyses, together with our on-the-ground experiences across our global business, continue to shape and evolve our approach to capital allocation and the criteria we use to support ongoing capital investment and the setting of appropriate risk-adjusted rates of return.\nToday, we have a leading international portfolio of nearly 183,000 sites that are contributing approximately 45% and 36% towards consolidated property revenues and operating profit, respectively. And are expected to deliver more than 8.5% in total tenant billings growth, including greater than a 6.5% organic growth in 2023. The secular demand trends driving our international growth remained consistent. Similar to the U.S., industry estimates forecast roughly $35 billion in carrier CapEx across our non-U.S. markets in 2023. And forecast suggests mobile data consumption is set to grow in the 20% to 30% range on average in these markets over the next several years, which would mark a continuation of the trends we've seen over the better part of the last 2 decades.\nGlobally, we've anchored our portfolio in key markets, which are in varying stages of network development relative to that of the U.S., where some level of 5G coverage deployed over a combination of low and mid-band spectrum, has reached approximately 95% of the population. In Europe, that number is closer to 60%, while Africa and Latin America are closer to 7% to 8%, suggesting a long tail of 5G other next-generation technology investments, requiring significant incremental network density and sell side points of presence. Critical to our expansion strategy has been our discipline in establishing appropriate contract structures with the leading MNOs in each geography. Although we've experienced certain consolidation-driven churn, events across our international portfolios over the past several years, we believe that through our proactive steps to increase exposure to leading multinational counterparties, we strategically reset our international customer base, enhancing the quality of our earnings and predictability of growth.\nIn fact, in Africa, approximately 90% of our Q2 property revenues are derived by market leaders, Airtel, MTN, Vodafone and Orange as compared to roughly 80% 5 years ago. In Europe, we similarly see over 80% of property revenues supported by Telefonica, Orange, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom versus less than 60% at the same time in 2018. In Latin America, which has a more fragmented customer base, given our operations across 8 markets, we're still generating approximately 75% of our property revenues from Telefonica, AT&T, America Mobil and Tim up from a little over 60% over the same time period. In addition to focusing on partnerships with market leaders, we've underwritten attractive leasing terms, including real estate rights and CPI-linked escalators in the vast majority of our contracts outside of India. This disciplined approach to securing growth through critical contract terms is evident in our results in Q2 with a combination of gross organic new business and our escalator generated just under 13.5% growth in aggregate for Latin America, Europe and Africa roughly 300 basis points over our trailing 5-year average.\nThis reflects our ability to complement new site leasing with attractive amendment growth across our international operations as we've done in the U.S. historically. In fact, looking again at Latin America, Europe and Africa, of the roughly $100 million we've generated through colocation and amendment growth over the past 12 months, around half, both in each region and in the aggregate has come in the form of amendments illustrating our ability to monetize various stages of network investment cycles and our success in franchising our proven U.S. tower model throughout our global operations. There's perhaps no better example of the benefits of remaining disciplined in terms of contract structure in Europe, or over the last several quarters, CPI-linked escalators in Germany and Spain have provided a boost to our organic growth profile. And where again, roughly half of our new business growth has been driven by 5G-related amendment activity on existing sites.\nIn 2023, these factors as well as a healthy leasing environment are coming together to drive an expectation for approximately 8% organic tenant billings growth in Europe, including an expectation for an acceleration in growth from colocations as we exit the year. As the 5G investment cycle continues, our contract structures, along with our work to develop leading operating capabilities in the region, and an ongoing expectation for low churn should allow us to deliver solid organic growth in the region for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the importance of the scale we've built as a distinct competitive advantage has never been clear. Through our global diversified presence and decades-long track record of operational excellence, we've established American Tower as a trusted strategic partner for our customers. This is exemplified by our new build program where we partnered with leading carriers to rapidly deploy new sites, which has driven some of our highest returns on invested capital.\nIn fact, since we began expanding internationally, we built over 45,000 international sites, which are achieving an NOI yield of approximately 25%. And approximately 65% of these sites have been built since the start of 2017 alone, shortly after we crossed the 100,000 international site mark. Nearly 8,000 of these sites have been built in Africa where our scale presence and strategic relationships with key wireless operators have afforded us the opportunity to build several thousand new sites in recent years that typically deliver mid-teen yields on day 1. As we continue to augment our scale in key markets across the region, 4G investments, which are very much in the middle innings today are driving compelling organic tenant billings growth in our existing assets including an expectation for greater than 11% growth in 2023, of which approximately 7% is coming from colocations and amendments, the highest of any region. And as the 4G cycle rounds out over the next few years and we move toward 5G and the densification requirements that come with it, we expect capacity utilization across the assets we've built over the last several years to result in ongoing compelling growth.\nMeanwhile, our regional scale and leading capabilities have resulted in the opportunity to invest in accretive platform extensions, such as our power as a Service program in Africa. As you'll see in our recently published sustainability report, through 2022, we've invested approximately $345 million in this program, primarily in solar arrays and lithium-ion battery solutions. As a result, we decreased annual diesel consumption at our sites in the region by an estimated 43.5 million liters when compared to business as usual operations and we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per tower by 21% against our 2019 baseline. Based on the demand to extend this program, it seems clear that this solution provides compelling differentiated value to our customers. At the same time, the program advances our progress towards meeting our science-based targets and supports our customers' network sustainability goals.\nMeanwhile, similar to our new build program, these investments have been among the highest return opportunities we've seen. And as more power-intensive 5G begins to be deployed at scale more broadly, we believe we'll be well positioned to continue extending the reach of this high-return program to new geographies over time. Finally, we're more focused than ever on leveraging the benefits of our scale to maximize the margin profile of the business. For example, through our global business services organization, we've invested in standardization across lease management and other transactional processes that's driving both significant increase in productivity and run rate savings on an annual basis. Through our procurement organization, we're beginning to truly leverage our scale as a buyer to reduce input costs in our build-to-suit programs, drive cost optimization when it comes to power and energy components and work with other critical vendors in our supply chain to realize incremental efficiencies.\nAnd while we're beginning to see the benefits of these and many other initiatives in our operations today, we believe we have a significant opportunity to transform our organization into one that is truly global and capable of maximizing the operating leverage inherent to the business to expand on an already attractive margin profile. In summary, we believe our global platform of assets is exceptionally positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a massive wave of incremental infrastructure demand required to support the technological advancements and network capabilities we're beginning to see in the market today. By complementing our U.S. platform with a continued disciplined approach to international growth and a focus on leveraging our scale, capabilities and learnings from over 2 decades of international and U.S. operations, we can provide compelling growth and margin expansion. An augmented return opportunity for investors and a differentiated value proposition for our customers for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to go through the quarterly results and updated outlook.\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong second quarter, reflecting a continuation of resilient demand for our diversified global portfolio and solid operational execution across our organization. Before I walk through the details of our Q2 results and revised full year outlook, I'll start with highlighting a few items from the quarter.\nFirst, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, raising approximately $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt through a combination of euro and U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes at a weighted average cost of 4.9%. As a result, we decreased our exposure to floating rate debt to approximately $6 billion or less than 15% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the second quarter. Next, the momentum experienced across our global business in Q1 continued into the second quarter with outperformance across new business, escalations and churn, resulting in another quarter of over 6% organic tenant billings growth allowing us to raise our full year expectations across our Latin America, Europe and Africa segments. We also had another strong quarter at CoreSite, where elevated leasing volumes since our acquisition continued into Q2 and were further supported by solid pricing trends, high renewal rates and interconnection growth of approximately 10% which together with our tower business drove property revenue growth of over 4% in the quarter.\nComplementing top line growth, and as I highlighted last quarter, we are maintaining a strong focus on cost management. Once again, in Q2, despite an elevated inflationary environment, we kept cash, SG&A roughly flat year-over-year, helping to support an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points to 63.1% or over 100 basis points when normalizing for VIL reserves. Finally, we continue to engage in active discussions with a focused group of investors around the potential sale of a majority equity interest in our India business as we assess strategic options in the market and exercise we anticipate completing in the second half of the year. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient with the goal of achieving the best outcome for American Tower and its shareholders.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, Q2 consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth was over 4%, or over 6% on an FX-neutral basis. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 5%, international growth of nearly 3% or over 7% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations and over 7% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter, we recognized approximately $35 million in revenue reserves associated with VIL short payments as collection patterns in Q2 were relatively consistent with that of Q1. Moving to the right side of the slide, we achieved another strong quarter of organic tenant billings growth, which stood at 6.2% on a consolidated basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and approximately 6.5% absent Sprint related churn including another quarter of elevated colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million.\nOur International segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily due to a combination of higher-than-anticipated colocation and amendment growth and continued churn delays, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9%, up from 7.5% in Q1. At a segment level, Africa, Europe and APAC produced growth of 12.9%, 8.3% and 5.6%, respectively, each an acceleration off of Q1, with Africa representing a record for the region, APAC delivering its highest quarter since Q3 of 2017. In Europe, demonstrating growth of over 575 basis points above its [ pre-Telsius ] average. In Latin America, we did see a modest deceleration of 5.4% as expected. Consistent with last quarter, we continue to realize benefits associated with CPI-linked escalators across the vast majority of our international markets. while a continued delay in anticipated consolidation-driven churn in Latin America has kept reported churn favorable to our initial expectations through the first half of the year. Finally, strong leasing trends across our international business has driven an acceleration in colocation and amendment growth contributions across nearly all of our segments, resulting in an approximately 40 basis point improvement sequentially at a consolidated international level.\nOrganic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of more than 565 sites with virtually all of the step down relative to Q1 associated with India volumes. As we continue to prioritize capital deployments across our footprint to projects that demonstrate the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return. Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 5% to over $1.7 billion or approximately 6% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 63.1% driven by elevated organic growth, combined with prudent cost controls throughout the business, which allowed for a conversion of over 85% of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth, again, on a normalized VIL basis. Cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 6.8%, and over 20 basis point improvement compared to prior year.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share decreased by less than 1% and approximately 2%, respectively. This decline includes financing cost headwinds of approximately 7% and 9% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, driven by the rise in interest rates over the past year. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, as mentioned earlier, we had a solid second quarter, and the core performance of the business continues to remain strong supporting an increase to our expectations for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share.\nNext, consistent with our prior outlook, we have maintained our VIL revenue reserve assumption of $75 million for the year. As I noted, we saw similar collection trends in the second quarter as compared to Q1. Bringing our year-to-date reserves associated with VIL to approximately $70 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, [ VIL ] made a full payment for July's billings and has committed to paying at least 100% of billings moving forward. In this case, we could potentially see some upside to our outlook assumption. However, we believe it is prudent to leave the full year assumption unchanged at this time. Additionally, we have assumed lower U.S. services volumes through the balance of the year, resulting in an approximately $40 million reduction in gross margin as compared to our prior outlook. While the recent pullback was more abrupt than our initial expectations, moderation in carrier spend following the recent historic levels of activity we've seen in the industry isn't unexpected and is consistent with past network generation investment cycles. Despite this reduction, we're still seeing healthy levels of activity on our sites, which we expect to continue, and our guide still assumes over $40 million in services gross margin contribution in the back half of the year which on an annualized basis, is still in excess of any year throughout the 4G cycle.\nIt is also important to note that although our services business is non-run rate, more susceptible to in-period carrier activity and cyclical in nature, our comprehensive MLAs continue to provide us with a high degree of visibility and contractual protection against activity variability in our 2023 property revenue and organic tenant billings guide, as well as the growth we've assumed in our long-term U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth target. Finally, on the macro side, we have revised our FX and interest assumptions. Starting with FX. Our revised outlook includes the negative impact associated with the recent devaluation in the Nigerian naira with impacts partially mitigated through the USD denomination of roughly half of our tenant revenues in the market. This is further offset by the strengthening of other currencies in our portfolio, resulting in minimal FX impacts versus our prior outlook.\nOn the interest side, our guidance reflects a modest increase to interest expense based on the updated forward curve estimates of SOFR, partially offset by interest income. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $125 million as compared to our prior outlook. Outperformance was driven by approximately $65 million in core property revenue supported by increases to the U.S. and Canada segment, which includes the benefits of several nonrecurring onetime items along with our U.S. data center and international segments. Complementing our core upside, we're also increasing our outlook by another $60 million, primarily associated with straight line and pass-through revenue.\nMoving to Slide 9. We are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth at a consolidated and international level. In the U.S. and Canada, we are maintaining our guidance of approximately 5% or over 6% excluding Sprint churn, with an expectation for at least $220 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from greater than 2% to approximately 4%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. In Europe, we are raising our guidance to approximately 8%, up from 7% to 8% previously, supported by modest improvements in our escalator contributions, together with an expectation for colocation and amendment growth to be closer to the upper end of our initial 2% to 3% assumption as we continue to make operational progress in Germany on leasing up our rooftop assets.\nNext, we're increasing our Africa outlook from approximately 9% to greater than 11%, primarily due to a continuation of solid new business demand. Although we are pleased with the acceleration in organic tenant billings growth in APAC in Q2, we are maintaining our prior outlook of approximately 4% at this time. Moving on to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $75 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue I just mentioned, facilitated through prudent cost controls resulting in an incremental $75 million in cash property gross margin, along with an additional $40 million, primarily due to straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $40 million associated with our U.S. services business. Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $25 million at the midpoint, representing approximately $0.05 on a per share basis moving the midpoint to $9.70 per share.\nUpdates to our expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $35 million, partially offset by approximately $10 million in other items, including the impacts of interest expense and also a slightly higher minority interest, which is the product of outperformance in our U.S. data center business. Moving on to Slide 12. While our capital allocation plans remain consistent relative to our prior outlook, primarily consisting of $3 billion in common stock dividends, subject to Board approval and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, I'd like to spend a moment to review our approach to ensure adequate capacity for our core site business as we support an elevated backlog and expectations for continued future demand.\nOn the left side of the slide, you see our plans continue to assume approximately $360 million in discretionary spend allocated to our U.S. data center business in 2023. This level of spend supports a high watermark of cash backlog, driven by the record levels of leasing since closing our acquisition at the end of 2021. Similarly, our retail and scale backlog, excluding hyperscale, is also at record levels, demonstrating the strength of the core business and diversification of new leasing which we expect to drive incremental ecosystem value and a continuation of the industry-leading returns CoreSite has produced historically. The differentiated nature of the CoreSite assets, representing a network cloud and digital platform rich interconnection hub, which in conjunction with large-scale, purpose-built adjacent capacity uniquely positions CoreSite to support the high-performance workloads of today and in the future. including expected incremental AI capacity.\nCombined with the favorable supply and demand dynamics we're seeing across the data center industry, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive double-digit stabilized yields on our development investments, largely supported by the reinvestment of CoreSite's own cash flows with further support from American Tower and our partner, Stonepeak. In fact, our pre-leasing at the end of the quarter was approximately 36%, which further derisks our capital investments and illustrates the robust demand we're seeing across the space. While such demand drives the need for incremental investment, we are eager to support the business and realize the attractive rates of return CoreSite has historically proven, while remaining selective and disciplined in current and future development priorities and decisions.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to execute on our financing initiatives in the quarter raising $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt, extending our average maturity to over 6 years while reducing our floating rate debt balance to below 15%. We also closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.3x ahead of our own deleveraging path towards our targeted range of 3 to 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic in potentially further accessing the debt capital markets to appropriately manage our investment-grade balance sheet. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. Our business continues to demonstrate resiliency and benefit from ongoing demand across our operations while effectively mitigating certain risks and variability through the strength of our customer agreements. Supported by a continuation and positive growth trends in Q2, we were able to increase the full year outlook midpoints across the majority of our key metrics, largely supported by core property outperformance across our tower and data center segments.\nWe believe our global portfolio, strong balance sheet, best-in-class operating capabilities, disciplined approach to capital allocation and keen focus to drive long-term efficiencies across our organization has American Tower well positioned to deliver strong, sustained growth in shareholder returns as we close 2023 and over the long term. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions.",

Welcome to the American Tower First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nHead of KKR Capital Markets, KKR & Co. LP\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nOn this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. tower and data center businesses. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2023 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance. Our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas Bartlett\n\nThanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As is customary for our first quarter call, my comments today will focus on our U.S. business, which is principally comprised of our tower and data center platforms, which made up 55%of our consolidated property revenue and 64% of our property operating profit in the first quarter of 2023.\nWith regard to our tower platform, the secular tailwinds that have supported outstanding growth over the last 2 decades remain consistent. Every year, U.S. wireless subscribers consume more mobile data through a growing number of devices and applications requiring faster speeds and lower latency performance. As a result of the increasing levels of data being consumed, our customers are deploying more equipment on our towers to meet that demand.\nIn addition, and more than ever before, our customers are utilizing multiple bands of spectrum to deliver those high-quality, ubiquitous levels of service. In 2022, U.S. carriers deployed around $40 billion in network capital to provide nationwide 5G services on mid-band spectrum. This record level of activity is reflective of the first major wave of the typical investment cycles we've seen over the last 20 years, during which carriers amend existing sites to provide initial coverage and capacity with the new technology and harvest benefits from core network enhancements and spectral efficiencies.\nIn previous cycles, these initial peaks have typically been followed by periods of moderation in overall spending, driven in part by reductions in spend on core upgrades, fiber and other infrastructure assets. However, we've historically seen tower spend remain in focus as our customers look to support continuous growth in mobile data consumption and provide market-leading network quality and reliability. And we would expect more of the same over the 5G cycle.\nIn 2023, while we're still in the relatively early stages of the overall 5G rollout, we continue to see customers making significant investments into their networks as part of their broader coverage initiatives, having yet to invest in densification at scale. These investments into adding and modifying equipment on our sites, which we've monetized to our MLAs, is driving 5.6% organic growth in Q1 or nearly 7%, absent the impacts of Sprint churn, our strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020 and for the full year, we expect $220 million in year-over-year growth contributions from colocations and amendments, a record for our U.S. business.\nLooking out over the next several years, we see an environment that is supportive of continued strong performance in the U.S. as the 5G investment cycle progresses and densification occurs. In American Tower, we've underwritten this expectation into the comprehensive MLAs that underpin our expectation to deliver average annual organic growth of at least 5% or 6% excluding the Sprint churn over the next 5 years, which closely mirrors the 6.2% average organic growth we experienced between 2016 and 2020.\nFurther, industry estimates suggest total monthly mobile data consumption that will require increased speed and lower latency is set to grow at a compounded annual rate of above 20% over the next 5 years, which we expect to be driven by continuous increases in mobile network utility, irrespective of potential impacts from any one category of new applications.\nAs a result, we believe our customers' networks will need to provide at least 2x the network capacity they have today in 3 to 4 years or roughly 3x today's capacity as we approach the end of the decade.\nOver time, we expect our customers to meet this demand through continued network upgrade and densification initiatives, spectrum refarming and the deployment of 5G on new spectrum. In this context, we believe our portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to serve our customers across the balance of the 5G cycle with significant capacity to accommodate additional equipment and new tenancies even beyond what's been contractually locked in today.\nAs we've done historically, we anticipate leveraging our best-in-class internal processes to generate incremental efficiency in the business and higher levels of service for our customers with both resulting in increasing conversion of our top line growth to AFFO.\nThrough a combination of organic growth and M&A, we've added nearly $2.4 billion in annual property revenues to our U.S. and Canada segment since 2014, paired with less than $60 million in incremental SG&A expense or roughly 2% of the corresponding revenue growth. This prudent approach to cost management and operational efficiency has helped to drive operating profit margin expansion in the segment by roughly 400 basis points over the period.\nGoing forward, given the benefits of our established scale, demonstrated ability to maximize the operating leverage potential inherent to our model and concerted efforts to further drive cost efficiencies at every level of the organization, we see a tremendous opportunity for capacity utilization in our existing assets to drive high-margin growth and expanding returns on invested capital as the 5G landscape continues to mature.\nNow with respect to our CoreSite U.S. data center platform, we are equally excited about the prospects for value creation. Increasingly complex digital business demands require enhanced infrastructure performance and flexibility. CoreSite serves as an optimal nexus for the cloud service providers, service integrators, networks and enterprise customers interoperate to propel their business initiatives forward.\nWe continue to see customers landing and expanding with CoreSite because it provides native access to key cloud service platforms and a diverse ecosystem, which allows them to serve their customers in a way that is flexible, scalable and it drives growth and efficiency in their businesses. This is reflected in the continued strength of CoreSite's leasing results, interconnection growth driven by both existing customers and new logos, as well as the ability to drive pricing, solid renewal rates and generate industry-leading returns.\nWe also recognize that we're still in the early stages of a broader digital transformation and movement. Each year, data center workloads and compute instances continue to grow at a rate of approximately 12% in the vast majority of all new IT architectures deployed into cloud and hybrid environments that CoreSite is uniquely positioned to support.\nAdditionally, we continue to expect to generate long-term growth from enterprise digital transformations and IT hybridization as organizations face workload management challenges that require the operational optionality, agility and critical interconnection capabilities that our CoreSite data center platform offers.\nImportantly, the absorption of this type of demand drives incremental value to our interconnection ecosystem and further builds on the momentum behind the CoreSite flywheel and the value we can provide our customers. So we see a long tail of opportunity to continue growing and scaling our campuses, and we have the added benefit of being able to prudently select opportunities that are accretive to our ecosystem.\nAs a result, we'll continue to invest cash flows generated in the data center segment back into the business, provide our customers incremental confidence in a long runway for growth with CoreSite and generate highly attractive returns.\nMeanwhile, our teams continue working to develop solutions that leverage our combined communications real estate platforms to position American Tower as a leading infrastructure provider for the networks of the future and create incremental value for our customers and shareholders alike.\nIn summary, our foundational U.S. tower and data center platforms are set to deliver continued growth and strong returns. We believe that the long-term secular tailwinds, the differentiated high-quality nature of both our U.S. tower portfolio and our data center interconnection platform, the value proposition they represent for our customers and the seasoned high talented teams managing them uniquely positions American Tower to create significant incremental value for the industry and our shareholders for many years to come.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our Q1 results and expectations for the balance of the year. Rod?\n\nRodney Smith\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, we are off to a solid start to the year with performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics.\nBefore diving into the results and the revised outlook for 2023, I'll start with a few highlights from the quarter. First, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, strong demand trends continue to drive favorable leasing and growth across our global footprint, which is a testament to the resiliency and stability of our business.\nIn Q1, we posted consolidated organic tenant billings growth of over 6%, our highest rate since 2017 and an over 300 basis point acceleration as compared to Q1 of 2022. This includes growth through colocations and amendments of over 5%, our highest in 3 years, as carriers continue to leverage our leading macro tower portfolio to aggressively roll out their networks to meet customer demand.\nOrganic leasing growth was further complemented by another quarter of strong new build volumes as we continue to leverage our scale and capabilities to attract accretive development opportunities from our leading customers across our international business.\nFinally, we had another record quarter of leasing from CoreSite, continuing the momentum from what was a record-breaking 2022 and exceeding our initial underwriting plan.\nComplementing our solid top line trends, our focus on cost management, combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model, drove margin expansion of approximately 270 basis points as compared to Q1 of last year to 63.7%, with the benefits being more noticeable given the absence of material M&A.\nGoing forward, we'll continue to manage our business with cost discipline, maximizing the profitability of our strong reoccurring organic growth profile.\nNext, we access the debt capital markets, successfully issuing $1.5 billion in unsecured notes and $1.3 billion in secured notes at attractive terms. Proceeds from these offerings more than cover our Q1 maturities and the remainder, together with the proceeds from various strategic initiatives, including the sale of the Mexico Fiber business, were used to pay down floating rate debt. As a result, we've reduced our floating balance by nearly $800 million year-to-date, now representing slightly over 20% of our debt structure.\nWe'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further manage this balance over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to have constructive discussions with potential investors as we assess strategic options for our India business. We remain focused on executing an outcome that maximizes value and optimizes our global portfolio mix and the risk-adjusted return profile for American Tower and its stakeholders.\nAs we move forward, we will keep our investors informed of any new developments.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you could see, Q1 consolidated property revenue growth was over 4% and approximately 7% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 4%, international growth of over 3% or nearly 9%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and approximately 10% growth in our U.S. data center business.\nIn the quarter, we benefited from accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, totaling approximately $39 million, partially offset by Vodafone Idea or VIL, revenue reserves of approximately $33 million, representing a modest improvement to payment trends as compared to the second half of 2022.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, organic tenant billings growth was a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth, standing at 6.4% on a consolidated basis, which as I mentioned, was our highest quarter since Q3 of 2017.\nIn our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6% and nearly 7% absent Sprint-related churn, including a record quarter of colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million, a nearly 65% increase as compared to the growth reported in Q1 of 2022.\nGrowth modestly exceeded our expectations, driven by some delays in churn, which we still anticipate to occur in the year and, to a lesser extent, new business upside. Similarly, our international operations experienced improvements across nearly all reported segments, generating organic tenant billings growth of 7.5% and an over 180 basis point acceleration from Q4 of 2022, which includes the benefits of CPI-linked escalator commencements across various contracts.\nAfrica generated its highest quarter on record with organic tenant billings growth of 12.1%, including escalator contributions of over 10% and a continuation of solid new business of nearly 7%. Growth in the quarter benefited from some delays in previously communicated carrier consolidation-driven churn, which we still expect to occur in the year.\nTurning to Europe, we saw a growth of 8.2% including over 6% from escalations, demonstrating our ability to monetize on CPI-linked escalators across the vast majority of our portfolio in the region.\nIn Latin America, we saw a growth of 6.1%, which includes relatively consistent escalator and new business growth, partially offset by the continued elevated churn, as we've highlighted on past calls. Churn in the quarter was favorable relative to our initial expectations as the decommissioning events have been slightly delayed to later in the year.\nLastly, in Asia Pacific, we saw a growth of 3.4%, demonstrating steady improvement over the past 3 quarters. This growth acceleration was mainly driven by colocation and amendment contributions as carriers ramp up 5G deployments. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of over 1,300 sites in the quarter, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of exceeding 1,000 sites, primarily in Africa and Asia Pacific, as carriers continue to invest in their network coverage and densification needs across the regions.\nInitial returns remained solidly in the double digits with Q1 constructed sites yielding nearly 14% on day 1.\nTurning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 9% to approximately $1.8 billion or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrated an approximately 270 basis point improvement year-over-year to 63.7% and still an over 190 basis point improvement when normalizing both periods of VIL-related revenue and bad debt reserves in India. This margin expansion was achieved through a continued focus on cost controls, allowing for approximately 100% conversion of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth. Again, on a normalized VIL basis and driving cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7.1% for the quarter.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO growth was 1.5%. While roughly flat on a per share basis, which includes financing cost headwinds of around 7.5% and 9.5% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, primarily driven by the rise in rates over the past year.\nLet's now turn to our revised full year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we had a strong first quarter, outperforming our initial expectations across the majority of our key metrics. While we are excited about the results to date and the sustainable demand trends that underpinned our performance, we have largely kept core and full year assumptions consistent to our prior guide, given our early position in the year and some of the timing benefits I alluded to earlier. This approach for our Q1 guidance is relatively consistent to past years. This also includes our assumptions around VIL-related revenue reserves, which we've held at $75 million for the year.\nAs noted earlier, we did record approximately $33 million in VIL reserves in Q1 with the guide applying an improvement for the duration of the year, notably in the back half. This assumption is supported by certain factors that we've considered in our risk assessment, including the customers' contractual obligations for 2023, our latest conversations with VIL management, where they've committed to meet these contractual obligations, and a demonstrated improvement in payments by the customer in Q1 relative to the second half of 2022.\nKey updates to our revised outlook includes the impacts from the recent sale of the fiber business in Mexico, together with the upsides from FX derived using our standard methodology and several small adjustments below EBITDA at the attributable AFFO level.\nWith that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8. We are reducing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million versus our prior outlook, driven by $45 million related to the sale of the fiber business in Mexico, partially offset by $25 million associated with the positive impacts of FX.\nMoving to Slide 9. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across our regions, and we'll continue to assess the positive momentum coming from our strong first quarter as we work further into the year.\nMoving on to Slide 10. We are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook with a decline of approximately $25 million related to the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by $25 million from positive impacts of FX.\nTurning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $20 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.05 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.65 per share. Updates to our expectations, aside from FX, include the cash adjusted EBITDA reduction driven by the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by favorable net interest in part due to the use of the sale proceeds to pay down debt and some cash tax savings.\nOn an isolated basis, the Mexico Fiber sale resulted in a $15 million decline to attributable AFFO as compared to our prior outlook midpoint.\nMoving on to Slide 12. I'll review our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities for 2023. Beginning on the left side of the slide, our capital allocation priorities for 2023 remain consistent with our prior outlook, which includes approximately $3 billion towards our common dividend, subject to Board approval, representing 10% growth year-over-year on a per share basis.\nIn addition, our CapEx outlook midpoints remain unchanged across all categories and support our initial plans to construct approximately 4,000 new sites across our international footprint.\nMoving to the right side of the slide. And as I highlighted earlier, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet in the first 3 months of the year, extending our average maturity profile to nearly 6 years while reducing our floating rate debt balance to slightly over 20%. Additionally, we closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.2x, well on track towards our deleveraging target of 3 to 5x.\nConsistent with our past remarks, we remain focused on driving shareholder value through our growing dividend and accretive CapEx program while strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging, maximizing liquidity, managing a diverse pool of capital sources and an ongoing assessment of market conditions to potentially further term out floating rate debt and extend our maturity profile.\nTurning to Slide 13 and in summary. Q1 was another strong quarter across our business with incremental steps taken towards strengthening our balance sheet. Underpinned by sustained demand trends across our global footprint, our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets generated accelerating leasing growth, while our capabilities as an operator and partner continue to afford us opportunities to deploy accretive capital to its high-yielding development projects.\nWe believe we are well positioned to drive compelling growth, supported by attractive secular trends across our global footprint and deliver solid returns to our shareholders over the long term.\nWith that, operator, we can open the line for questions.",

Welcome to the American Tower Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of IR, American Tower Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our strategy; and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2022 results and 2023 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance. Our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. 5 years ago, when we rolled out the Stand and Deliver strategy that would guide us over the following decade, we emphasized driving the business forward through 4 key pillars: enhancing operational efficiency, growing our assets and capabilities, investing in innovation and platform extensions and augmenting industry leadership.\nSince that time, we've seen carriers across our global footprint invest over $300 billion in network assets and methodically deploy next-generation networks to support rapidly increasing data demand in their served markets. Our commitment to execute on each pillar of Stand and Deliver not only aligns with our customers' needs in this context, but it also enhances American Tower's position to serve as a strategic provider of critical infrastructure for the networks of the future.\nSo before highlighting the key strategic objectives we'll focus on in 2023 and over the next several years, I'd like to spend a moment reviewing achievements from the past 5 years that have driven our success to date.\nOn the operational front, we've signed comprehensive master lease agreements with T-Mobile, AT&T, DISH and most recently, Verizon in the United States. These agreements represent a commitment to a mutually beneficial, predictable growth path and strategic alignment between American Tower and its customers while also demonstrating the value and criticality of our nationwide 43,000-plus site portfolio to support 4G, 5G and future network generations. Such agreements also bring with them efficiency innovations designed to deliver simplicity in leasing processes and accelerated time to market for the carriers.\nTo extend on these benefits, we've invested in technologies to build a holistic standardized data set, mapping the vast majority of our U.S. assets, which can be leveraged to eventually bring application cycle times down to a matter of hours. We believe this type of capability will be a particularly attractive customer value proposition in the context of a 5G densification cycle and one we believe can be scaled across our global footprint over time.\nOur focus on operational efficiency has extended throughout our international business as well. Notably, since the beginning of 2018, we've invested nearly $350 million, primarily in Africa, on improving site level performance through our Power as a Service program. This includes the installation of lithium-ion batteries and solar arrays for primary and backup power delivery, which has resulted in a sizable reduction in average fuel consumption per site across our African portfolio and has extended the replacement cycles of critical power sources all while providing over a 99.9% average uptime for our customers' networks.\nAt the same time, we've established a centralized procurement organization that aims to drive down material costs. And we've leveraged shared best practices and our scale as a multinational operator to strengthen our global vendor relationships. By streamlining these critical operational functions, we've been able to continue to drive solid investment returns on our capital deployments and efficiently meet the infrastructure needs of our customers, all against a challenging backdrop of price volatility and supply chain disruptions.\nIn fact, since the start of 2018, we've added nearly 26,000 sites to our international portfolio through new builds, more than 2x the volume of the previous 5-year period. Today, these sites are contributing approximately $250 million in tower cash flow and an NOI yield of approximately 21%, demonstrating meaningful expansion from the already attractive low double-digit day 1 yields we typically see on these new build opportunities.\nOn the M&A front, we've executed a number of transactions that have been transformational in terms of delivering additional critical scale in existing and new markets ahead of major network investment cycle, the benefits of which we are seeing in our results and forward-looking expectations today. These include InSite in the United States, The Eaton portfolio in Africa as well as Telxius in Europe and Latin America, which augmented our scale in Germany and provided entry to Spain in a leadership position just as 5G investments were beginning to ramp up on the continent.\nMore recently, through our efforts to selectively expand our platform and position American Tower as a market leader in the next generation of network architecture development, we entered the data center space through the acquisition of CoreSite. CoreSite delivers an interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich platform as well as exposure to a resilient high-demand communications infrastructure business, which we believe will deliver strong performance as demonstrated by a record signed new business in 2022 and provide accretive returns on a stand-alone basis over time. As importantly, we believe the combination of CoreSite and American Towers platform of distributed tower in real estate positions us to enhance the value of our existing assets as the edge proliferates.\nFinally, I'm particularly proud of the steps we've made towards augmenting our leadership in several areas. Organizationally, we've made ESG core to our operations through initiatives such as our commitment to science-based targets, localized DE&I initiatives designed to facilitate an inclusive organization for our employees and stakeholders and through the growth of our digital communities program, which has now reached more than 400 communities and serves more than 335,000 people across 15 countries.\nAs I mentioned on this call last year, we're also a member of the Edison Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge, which provides us the opportunity to contribute to the development of affordable and accessible digital health care, finance and education solutions for communities in need. Over the past year, we've developed partnerships with health care providers that have resulted in the launch of several telehealth locations that provide primary, preventative and specialty teleconsultation services in underserved areas.\nWhile this is just one positive first step, we believe that we've achieved over the last year clearly demonstrates the value we can create and the communities we serve through a commitment to multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. And we hope more organizations will join us in efforts like these over the coming years, which brings us to today and our focus for 2023 and beyond.\nWe believe we're poised to build on and accelerate the successes of Stand and Deliver that we've achieved thus far. As I mentioned in the opening, our teams are focused on key strategic objectives that will continue to guide our operations and management teams in American Tower over the next several years.\nThe first of these is to leverage our premier platform of assets to drive strong recurring growth, both organically and through our disciplined capital allocation framework and our investment-grade balance sheet as we seek to capture new business opportunities against the backdrop of secular demand trends that remain as strong as ever. We refer to this internally as scale the core.\nTo this end, we expect an acceleration in organic growth in 2023, representing an improvement of around 100 basis points relative to our prior 5-year average. Beginning with our U.S. and Canada segment, the benefits of our comprehensive MLAs and ongoing 5G deployments are driving an expectation for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% in 2023, including approximately $220 million in year-over-year colocation and amendment growth, which would be a record year for American Tower by a significant margin.\nWe also see a path to solid organic growth in our international segment led by regions like Europe and Africa, where we're capturing activity from multiple network upgrade and densification cycles and are realizing the benefits of CPI-linked escalators on the vast majority of our leases.\nThis will be complemented by what we expect to be yet another year of solid new build activity primarily in international markets, where the current 4G and 5G network rollouts continue to drive strong demand for new infrastructure. And in our data centers business, where we're entering 2023 with record backlog, we'll continue to focus on driving increasing growth, both on an organic basis and through high-yield development opportunities that are ongoing today.\nOperationally, our teams are working to continue to build on the many efficiency and growth initiatives we've developed in recent years, which hits on another key objective within the organization: being the most trusted strategic partner for our customers. The most concrete example of our efforts on this front, probably the long-term multimarket agreement we recently announced with Airtel in Africa, which includes a meaningful new build pipeline, a joint commitment to build in accordance with new low-carbon emissions guidelines which we're calling green sights and a partnership framework to enhance the impacts of both companies' digital communities and kiosks programs on the continent.\nThis agreement exemplifies the benefits of our scale, best-in-class operations and ability to deliver innovative solutions while advancing both American Tower and our customers' long-term sustainability and fossil fuel consumption reduction targets. Going forward, we'll continue to work on building alignments with our global customers to leverage our scale to execute on opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder returns in a sustainable and responsible way.\nThis includes an effort to accelerate our platform extensions. As I mentioned previously, demand trends in the data center space remain robust driven by digital platforms, leveraging distributed computing and by the early stages of a sustained enterprise migration from on-prem to hybrid IT and multi-cloud architectures.\nAs a result, we see a long runway of opportunity to drive strong returns by investing in the expansion of our existing CoreSite campuses and leveraging the open cloud exchange to extend their interconnection-rich ecosystem. At the same time, we're working to position our combined platforms for outsized success as demand for the workloads and compute functions are drawn closer to the end users at the mobile edge.\nAnd as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth through platform extensions going forward, we'll continue to focus on how we can leverage our core competencies in real estate, power provision and connectivity to drive incremental value to the ecosystem while delivering increasing shareholder returns. Meanwhile, as a management team, we're laser-focused on positioning our global teams for the future while growing and maintaining a healthy cultural foundation.\nThese together represent perhaps our most critical key objectives as our world-class team members are the most valuable asset in American Tower. As we position the company to be a market leader in an evolving landscape, we recognize that developing, empowering and retaining diverse and talented team members is fundamental to our success as a company.\nThrough this lens, we've renewed our focus on management development and institute region-specific programs designed to support a balanced life for our teams amongst many other initiatives. We also appreciate that facilitating a culture that is inclusive and equitable is not only shown to drive better decision-making in business outcomes, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do for the people who dedicate so much of their time to growing this business and delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn summary, the long-term secular demand trends underpinning growth in our industry remain resilient. We believe we're optimally positioned to capitalize on the successes of our Stand and Deliver strategy to date. And we're more energized than ever as we look to execute on our initiatives in 2023 and deliver strong, sustainable returns for many years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to discuss our 2022 results and expectations for 2023. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2022 results and expectations for 2023, I would like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year and provide an update on several developments in India since our last earnings call.\nFirst, demand and operational performance across our global portfolio remain as solid as ever. We closed the year on a positive note with colocation and amendment tenant billings growth contributions of over 4% in Q4.\nIn particular, our U.S. and Canada property segment delivered its strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020, and we have a clear line of sight to continued acceleration into 2023, which I will discuss shortly. Organic growth was complemented by the construction of nearly 7,000 sites, an American Tower record, including over 2,300 sites built in Q4, our highest level over the past 8 quarters with an average day 1 NOI yield of over 12%.\nMoreover, during its first full year of ownership by American Tower, CoreSite delivered record new business, selling nearly double the number of megawatts compared to the previous trailing 2-year average, demonstrating the value of the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem. This robust growth was driven by increased demand from high-quality new logos and expansions from existing customers driven by secular tailwinds of digital transformation and the demand for hybrid IT solutions.\nFurthermore, since the announcement of CoreSite acquisition, we successfully executed on our permanent financing plan at attractive terms, including through the issuance of common equity and senior notes as well as our strategic partnership with Stonepeak. These financing activities reduced our leverage from 6.8x at the end of 2021 to 5.4x at the end of 2022 and moved us closer to our target range of 3 to 5x.\nNext, I'd like to take a moment to cover the latest developments in India. As anticipated, Vodafone Idea or VIL continued making partial payments in Q4 of 2022, consistent with our outlook, resulting in total revenue reserves of approximately $38 million for the quarter and around $87 million for the year.\nRecently, we were pleased to see the completion of the Indian government's conversion of the adjusted gross revenue interest balances to equity in VIL. We view this as a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to support a 3-player private carrier telecommunications market and a critical first step towards the possibility of more stabilized collections from VIL.\nHowever, although VIL had committed to pay their billings in full in 2023 and make payments for outstanding balances from prior years in early 2023, they have communicated that they would continue to make partial payments. For that reason, we believe it is prudent to include revenue reserves against their annual billings and other contracted obligations in our 2023 outlook, which we've assumed at $75 million. We will, however, remain focused on collecting what we are contractually owed in full over the course of the year.\nIn the meantime, we have worked to incrementally better position American Tower and our receivables balance while also demonstrating a level of support for VIL in India's wireless market. This includes the expectation to convert approximately $200 million in existing VIL receivables into optionally convertible debentures pending Vodafone Idea shareholder approval.\nUpon closing this agreement, we would have elevated the seniority of our pre-existing receivables balance and established an additional level of liquid collateral at American Tower's option. And finally, as we remain focused on stabilizing our India business, collecting our outstanding and future receivables in full and assessing the positioning of our global portfolio, we are currently exploring various strategic options, including the potential sale of an equity stake in our India business.\nAs always, any decision taken will include careful consideration of the growth opportunity and risk profile in the market going forward, valuation and the optimal portfolio and capital structure mix for American Tower and its stakeholders. We will certainly keep our investors informed of any developments as we move forward.\nWith that, let's dive into the details of our full year 2022 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was nearly 15% and nearly 18% on an FX-neutral basis, which included a contribution of approximately 11% of growth from Telxius and CoreSite and negative impacts of approximately 2% and 1% from Sprint churn and revenue reserves taken associated with VIL in 2022, respectively.\nOrganic tenant billings growth for the full year came in at 3.2%, in line with expectations, complemented by solid growth from new builds with actual volumes coming in at the upper end of our prior outlook range for the year. In the United States and Canada, property revenue growth was nearly 2% with organic tenant billings growth of just over 1%, in line with expectations, including approximately $150 million or 3.4% from colocations and amendments.\nEscalators added another 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was partially offset by churn of around 5%, which consisted of roughly 1% in normal course churn with the balance being driven by Sprint.\nOur international property revenue grew by nearly 13%. International organic tenant billings growth was 6.6%, led by Europe at 8.4% and followed by Latin America at 7.9%, Africa at 7.7% and APAC at 2.6%. Overall, colocation and amendment growth for the full year was around 5% while 6% came from escalators, partially offset by just over 4.5% of churn, the result of decommissioning agreements in Latin America, carrier consolidation in Africa and customer-specific churn in APAC.\nFinally, our data center segment contributed over $765 million to our total property revenue in 2022, including a record year of new business from CoreSite as I previously mentioned.\nMoving on, adjusted EBITDA grew around 11% to over $6.6 billion or around 13% on an FX-neutral basis for the year. Growth was supported by solid contributions from Telxius and CoreSite and strong flow-through of top line growth achieved through effective cost management.\nOn a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 190 basis points as compared to 2021 primarily due to the impacts of the VIL reserves and Sprint churn in the U.S., higher pass-through revenue due to rising fuel costs and the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by approximately 5.6% and 3.5%, respectively, including over 11% growth on a per share basis in Q4. For the year, both metrics included over 2% in headwinds associated with FX. Attributable AFFO per share of $9.76 exceeded the original 2022 outlook midpoint laid out a year ago by $0.06 despite absorbing the negative impacts of incremental VIL reserves, rate-driven interest costs and FX relative to our initial assumptions.\nNow before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2023, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, as we've previously communicated, we expect a meaningful step-up in U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth driven by an acceleration in new business backstopped by the comprehensive MLAs we have signed over the last few years together with the sequential improvement in contracted Sprint churn.\nInternationally, we expect a strong year of organic tenant billings growth across most of our regions driven by continued strength in organic leasing trends along with contributions from CPI-based escalators, particularly in Europe and Africa. As we've communicated over the past couple of quarters, growth in Latin America will be moderated by churn headwinds associated with a continuation of Telefónica churn in Mexico and Oi churn in Brazil, where we'll see some staggered impacts over the next several years.\nSecond, and as I mentioned earlier, we have factored into our guide an expectation for a continuation in VIL collections volatility, resulting in an assumption of $75 million in revenue reserves for the year.\nThird, given the unprecedented rise in interest rates over the course of 2022, which saw the 1-month LIBOR increased by more than 400 basis points and 10-year treasuries increased by around 250 basis points from the beginning to the end of the year, we expect 2023 to have onetime outsized negative growth headwinds associated with financing costs.\nKey components driving this assumption include elevated costs on our floating rate debt and to a lesser extent, the refinancing of our 2023 senior note maturities as well as the full year impacts of our 2022 equity-related initiatives, including our common equity issuance and the incremental minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our partnership with Stonepeak. Taken together, we have assumed a roughly 8% headwind to attributable AFFO per share growth associated with financing costs in 2023.\nNext, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $151 million for property revenue, $64 million for adjusted EBITDA and $47 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2022. And finally, looking beyond the challenges I mentioned associated with interest rates, VIL reserves and FX, our core business continues to demonstrate strong performance and resiliency, representing nearly double-digit year-over-year growth at the attributable AFFO level.\nWhile this performance is fueled by the solid organic leasing trends we're seeing across our global portfolio, it's further amplified by exceptional conversion rates through AFFO, achieved through a keen focus on cost management across our business.\nWith that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving on to the details of Slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenues of nearly $10.8 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% or approximately 4% absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023. Our guide includes expected cash revenue growth of around $230 million in the U.S. and Canada and $245 million of FX-neutral growth in our international regions, excluding the 2023 VIL reserves of $75 million. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $55 million of growth in cash revenue to the property segment in 2023. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate a modest FX headwind of just under 1.5% to consolidated growth.\nTurning to Slide 8. We expect organic growth to contribute meaningfully to our property revenue growth assumptions. Starting with the U.S. and Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% or greater than 6% excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes record levels of year-over-year colocation and amendment growth of around $220 million, a nearly 50% increase over the levels achieved in 2022 and a 60% increase as compared to the trailing 3-year average. Of the $220 million, over 90% is locked in through MLA-driven use right fee commencements and carryover growth.\nOn the churn side of the equation, after incurring the largest impact of Sprint churn last year, we expect churn of around 3% in 2023, including an approximate 1% impact associated with Sprint, which would represent a year-over-year improvement of over 200 basis points in the segment.\nMoving to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 2% for the year driven by relatively consistent colocation and amendment activity and continued solid contributions from CPI-based escalators of approximately 8%. This escalator rate does represent a step down from 2022 levels as we saw inflation in markets like Brazil moderate in 2022 as compared to 2021.\nAs we've previously highlighted, higher churn of around 8% is partially offsetting gross growth due to the expected continuation of Telefónica churn in Mexico and the early part of what we expect to be staggered Oi churn in Brazil.\nSimilar to last year, we do expect to receive some settlement payments from Telefónica over the course of the year, which will be captured outside of the organic tenant billings growth metric. We've assumed approximately $50 million in 2023 payments as compared to the over $80 million we received from Telefónica Mexico and Nextel Brazil in 2022.\nTurning to Asia Pacific. We are guiding to approximately 4% organic tenant billings growth in 2023, including churn of around 4%, which is around 70 basis points lower than the 2022 churn rate. We expect colocation and amendment growth contributions to ramp up compared to 2022, coming in around 6%, fueled by the rollout of 5G networks. However, it is important to note that the reserves we've assumed for VIL in our guide reside outside of this metric, consistent with past practices.\nTurning to Europe. 2023 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 7% to 8%, which is slightly lower than 2022 due to the mathematical benefits realized last year, given Telxius was only in the prior year base for a partial year. However, this does suggest a solid acceleration off our Q4 2022 organic growth rate of around 6%, which represents a more normalized comparison.\nOn the colocation and amendment front, we anticipate 2% to 3% growth while growth from escalators stand at roughly 6%, reflecting the benefits of CPI-linked escalators across the majority of our European footprint. Churn is expected to decline to around 1%, reaping the benefits of the lower churn profile of our recently acquired Telxius portfolio.\nFinally, in Africa, we expect a solid acceleration off of 2022 with expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9%. This includes colocation and amendment contributions of around 6% along with escalators of around 10% and expected 450 basis point increase from 2022 levels. This will be partially offset by an expectation of elevated churn of greater than 6% as carrier consolidation continues to work its way through the financial metrics.\nMoving on to Slide 9. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 4% and around 5% absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023 while absorbing approximately 1% in FX headwinds. We expect this growth to be achieved through solid cash conversion rates of 85% to 90%, the result of prudent cost controls across the business and the expectations for another strong year from our U.S. services business.\nTurning to Slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to decrease by $0.16 on a reported basis while remaining flat year-over-year absent the impacts of the 2023 VIL revenue reserves. As mentioned, we expect growth to be meaningfully impacted by financing costs, which include a rate-driven increase to cash interest expense along with the incremental full year impact of minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our U.S. data center business.\nTogether with the common equity share issuance in 2022, financing costs are expected to provide a significant onetime growth headwinds of approximately 8% in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, absent the impact of financing costs, FX and the 2023 VIL reserves, our business is demonstrating solid growth contributions of around 9%.\nMoving on to Slide 11. I'll review our capital plans for 2023 and our balance sheet progress and priorities for the upcoming year. In 2023, we will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders through the growth of our dividend. In subject to Board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $3 billion, representing an approximately 10% year-on-year growth rate on a per share basis.\nIn addition, we expect to deploy around $1.7 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. This will largely be spent continuing the success of our new build program internationally, which assumes the construction of around 4,000 sites at the midpoint. We also expect data center capital to increase modestly as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity.\nMoving to the right side of the slide. As you can see, we made tremendous progress towards strengthening our balance sheet over the course of 2022, putting us ahead of the deleveraging path we committed to with the rating agencies, which actually afforded us the flexibility to repurchase a modest number of our shares in Q4.\nThroughout 2023, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing financial policies as we execute on our financing plans. This includes the refinancing of maturing debt while leveraging our strong liquidity position as needed to remain opportunistic as we access the capital markets.\nFinally, we remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. And our priorities over the course of 2023 and into 2024 remain on deleveraging our balance sheet back down to the 3 to 5x range. Consistent with our recent comments, at this time, we do not see any material M&A in our pipeline that would alter these areas of focus.\nTurning to Slide 12. And in summary, we delivered strong results in 2022, demonstrating the resiliency of our business model in the face of various macro-related and customer-specific challenges. Our global portfolio of assets and operational capabilities continue to prove critical in meeting the growing demands of our customers and the customers they serve.\nWe saw record new build volumes internationally and record leasing within our CoreSite business and experienced a steady acceleration in colocation and amendment growth as we exited 2022, which we expect to continue into 2023. As we look ahead, we expect to further build on the successes of the recent years and leverage our portfolio to drive strong recurring growth on the back of consistent secular technology trends for many years to come.\nWith that, operator, we can open up the line for questions.",

Welcome to the American Tower Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of IR, American Tower Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will discuss current technology trends and how we are positioned to benefit from continued wireless technology evolution. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q3 2022 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance. Our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India, the Stonepeak transaction and the expected value and future investment activities of our U.S. data center business, our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as updated in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC.\nWe urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As is typical for our third quarter call, my comments today will center on the key technology trends we're seeing across the wireless landscape and how our distributed tower portfolio is positioned to benefit from next-generation network deployment and generate sustained resilient growth despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, I'll provide an update on the CoreSite portfolio of assets, our latest view on the evolution of the Mobile Edge and the progress we are making in advancing our Edge strategy, which aims to leverage our distributed tower and land assets. In combination with our interconnected data center portfolio to drive incremental value as network technology evolves.\nSince the start of 2019, 5G spectrum auctions, mainly in the mid band have collectively driven over $155 billion in purchase price proceeds across our served market. These acquisitions of large swaths of new spectrum have kicked off what we believe will be at least a decade-long period of network investments aimed at delivering on the promises of 5G's faster and lower latency applications.\nWe anticipate this will result in $5 billion of incremental annual customer CapEx spend in the United States, on average, as compared to the levels we saw throughout the 4G cycle. Additionally, in the U.S. The visibility we gained through the comprehensive MLAs we put in place with AT&T, T-Mobile, DISH and most recently, Verizon supports our expectation that these investments will drive a near-term acceleration in organic new business growth and a sustained level of elevated tower activity over a multiyear period.\nAs we saw during the rollout of 4G, we expect this investment cycle to play out in 2 broad phases. The first being a coverage phase through which carriers prioritize upgrading their existing footprint to maximize the percentage of the population having 5G access and begin to benefit from the cost efficiencies associated with their network technology upgrades.\nOver the last year, we've seen carriers leveraging our presence in nationwide scale to efficiently and aggressively upgrade equipment on our sites, both here in the United States and in several markets across our international footprint to meet those 5G build-out objectives.\nIn the second phase as consumers adopt advanced 5G-enabled mobile devices and applications, carriers will invest in additional capacity through network densification to facilitate increased mobile data consumption and optimized customer experience. We saw this second phase play out after 4G was launched in the United States around 2010.\nBy coupling the provision of higher bandwidth speed and improved network capabilities with the proliferation of advanced smart connected devices with improved user interfaces, 4G unleashed innovative applications, such as video streaming, mobile gaming as well as industry redefining application, which is mobile-enabled ride sharing and transportation.\nThe introduction of these new data-intensive applications contributed to an annual consumption growth rate of nearly 50% from 2013 to 2018, requiring carriers to meaningfully invest in the densification of their network.\nSimilarly, we expect our customer's 5G network anticipating delivery times of 5x to 10x lower latency and increased download speeds up to 100x to further unlock new capabilities, facilitate consumer and enterprise innovations, enable use cases that will necessitate further proliferation of connected devices and drive higher network throughput.\nConsider emerging augmented and virtual reality technology as an example. Video streaming exploded primarily because of the advancements achieved through 4G, driving extended densification investment in order to provide users with adequate network quality. Currently, video streaming bandwidth requirements range from a few megabits per second to about 8 megabits per second for HD and up to 25 megabits per second for 4K, depending upon the resolution, eventually working to 50 and closer to 100 megabits per second for 8K videos.\nDepending on compression schemes and the device requirements, looking ahead to the theoretical max specs for potential future applications of mix reality, we would expect multiple gigabits per second. Again, that is gigabits with the G.\nCompared to 4G, 5G will offer enhanced resolution, rapid refresh rates, real-time raw midstream with low latency and provides 3x more bits per Hertz spectrum efficiency in the 5G mid band. Even when factoring in all these benefits, we believe rapid mobile data consumption growth along with the shorter propagation characteristics of mid band spectrum will necessitate a massive 5G densification phase of network investment, greater than what we realized in 4G.\nAs a result, we expect this future capacity phase to support sustained growth in our tower business. At the same time, we expect the applications driving these densification efforts to present new neutral host infrastructure opportunities aimed at minimizing latency and reducing traffic burdens on middle mile network.\nThis is a good segue into a discussion about our CoreSite data center activity and the progress we're making in advancing our Edge strategy to support these networks of the future. While the tower business certainly remains healthy and staggered deployment of network generation rollouts across our geographically diverse footprint provides solid runway for growth over the next decade, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities for value creation through the platform expansion pillar of our stand and deliver strategy.\nA key element of this pillar is identifying new opportunities that leverage our portfolio of communication assets and our capabilities in managing and redeveloping distributed real estate to provide new multi-tenant neutral host infrastructure model that support the demands of next-generation networks and applications.\nAs we previously communicated, the most apparent opportunity of scale that we see over the next decade is out of the Mobile Edge which ultimately solidified our decision to acquire CoreSite at the end of 2021. We still believe this acquisition further positions us to take advantage of the emerging digital transformation enabled by 5G.\nHaving now owned CoreSite for more than 3 quarters, we couldn't be happier with the performance we're seeing across the business and the use cases driving leasing activity, which we expect to serve as growth catalysts well into the future. Importantly, we're extremely encouraged by the consistently positive customer feedback on this acquisition. Customers continue to view CoreSite as a strong operator in hybrid IT solutions provider with a high-quality ecosystem, which under the American Tower umbrella can now provide more predictable scalability and future incremental value through our combined platform, capabilities and expertise.\nSo far in 2022, CoreSite has achieved solid new business volumes, a reflection of the strong demand for the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem, where over 80% of revenues are derived by customers with a variety of interconnections to at least 5 different and independent customers.\nThis strong demand demonstrates the differentiated value proposition and resiliency of these strategically located and well-integrated assets. We are pleased to see strong new business volumes from enterprises, prioritizing digital transformation to the implementation of hybrid IT solutions. Leading the migrations from an on-premise data centers to co-location data centers in major metros. We are also encouraged to see accelerating demand from leading digital platform, seeking to extend compute functionality closer to their users to enable automation, collaboration and address latency-sensitive applications and early indicators supporting our Edge evolution thesis.\nCritical to CoreSite's interconnection-rich ecosystem value proposition is its open cloud exchange platform or OCX. OCX provides CoreSite customers with quick scalability and represents an essential element as we seek to expand the ecosystem to more distributed points of presence as the Edge develops.\nToday, through this automated Layer 2 Ethernet software-defined networking platform, we connect our customer communities within and between our U.S. data centers, and we connect cloud providers to CoreSite's nationwide portfolio. We continue to invest in improving the platform's features and building out the functionality and reach to enable high-performance, hybrid architectures more quickly and securely and at a lower total cost of operation than alternative solutions.\nMore recently, we launched Layer 3 enhanced network services, including virtual routing, cloud connect hearing to service providers and cloud-to-cloud connectivity to leading cloud providers. These enhanced functionalities simplify an enterprise's network hardware or management resources at a lower total cost of ownership.\nThrough continued innovation over time, CoreSite division is to provide customers with single port access to their entire digital supply chain, which we will also expect to be leveraged and extended as the distributed interconnected edge ecosystem develops over time.\nWhile the distinctive characteristics of CoreSite's portfolio, including its enhanced capabilities accorded to its OCX platform represent the critical attribute in advancing our Edge strategy, we also see tremendous value in CoreSite's development pipeline. CoreSite continues to execute on opportunities to redeploy their cash flow towards high-yielding development project. Customers require additional scale across our footprint. And consequently, over 20% of our data center development under construction is now pre-leased.\nWe also recently announced the acquisition of a purpose-built data center in Southern Florida, MI2, which will be connected to our existing Miami facility, expanding and strengthening our Southeastern footprint where we have also integrated our legacy data centers in Atlanta and Orlando into the CoreSite ecosystem.\nAs we look further out, we expect workloads to become even more distributed and localized. Therefore, we see the importance of an interconnection hub like CoreSite, increasing as customers look to future-proof their digital businesses to secure flexible and scalable solution enabling agile interoperability as businesses shift to more customized hybrid multi-cloud IT environment and importantly, require an extended edge computing presence to support evolving low latency applications.\nIn turn, the Mobile Edge is emerging as a critical area in the convergence of wireless and wireline network. Over the past year, this 5G deployments in the U.S. have continued at a rapid pace, we've seen elevated emphasis from select wireless carriers with respect to their edge compute strategies and the forging a partnership with cloud and enterprise technology platforms to better prepare for the network demands of the future.\nWe see all of this as incremental data points in support of our vision for forthcoming demand of VA. In our view, much like the adoption of the shared tower model, this digital ecosystem over time will be most efficiently provisioned through a distributed neutral host, multi-tenant interconnected edge infrastructure model reducing the capital intensity and total cost of ownership among MNOs, cloud, landline and enterprise players and critically, facilitating a seamless universal customer experience for end users.\nOur tower portfolio, coupled with our U.S. data center business, represents a distributed portfolio of real estate with accessibility to robustly interconnected core network and native access to cloud on rent. We believe the combination of these platforms will be critical as data processing extends from the Core to the Edge. With that migration, more distributed and localized points of presence, along with transit costs and low latency considerations, will become essential over time, providing American Tower and CoreSite, the potential to win across multiple edge layers.\nTo date, our team has identified over 1,000 sites within our existing U.S. tower portfolio that we see as shovel-ready candidate for Mobile Edge deployment based on location, parcel footprint, land control and existing fiber and power access. Over the next several months, we plan to break ground on our first 1 megawatt edge facility and an owned tower site to build upon our understanding of market demand and customer requirements.\nDesigned a blueprint that can be rolled out at scale as the Edge ecosystem developed and demonstrates the differentiated value proposition at American Tower and CoreSite can offer potential customers. As always, any future development will go through our disciplined approach to evaluating the market opportunity and economic returns of Edge deployments at scale as well as an evaluation of the best way to finance future deployment which could potentially include strategic partnerships, financial sponsors or both.\nIn short, the strategic partnerships emerging between the MNOs and cloud service providers, the evolution of latency-driven edge leasing activity within our CoreSite side portfolio and our interactions with the architects, the low latency networks of the future have only strengthened our conviction. The Edge will represent a meaningful opportunity to drive incremental value to our assets over the long term.\nAlthough this architecture will take time to develop, American Tower is positioning itself as a critical future provider and partner for cloud, MNO and enterprise customers as wireless and wireline network convergence accelerates over time. In the meantime, we'll seek opportunities to advance our learnings, including through the development of an Edge application integrator and our participation in various trials in Edge industry form.\nWe are proactively taking the necessary steps to understand emerging trends, network requirements and customer needs, all aimed at strengthening our option to win at the Edge over the long term.\nIn closing, demand for wireless connectivity continues to grow across the globe where despite the dynamic challenges we've all navigated over the past several years, the need for reliable wireless and broadband access has been elevated in importance as a means to advance global economies and the populations they serve.\nWith carriers aggressively deploying their valuable spectrum assets, we will begin to realize the true capabilities of 5G. And with that, we expect to see new innovations that will change the way we live for the next decade and beyond. Our effort to build scale across our global footprint of macro tower assets for over the past 2 decades, combined with our continuous focus on platform expansion and innovation has positioned American Tower to support our customers in meeting the continued acceleration in mobile data demand, while leading the way in the development of new infrastructure model that will be essential in meeting the needs of applications of the future and drive incremental value on our assets over time.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full year 2022 outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you heard from Tom, we are very encouraged by the technological trends that we believe will drive continued secular growth in the industry and a long runway of growth for American Tower. Before I walk through the details of our Q3 results and revised outlook, I will first touch on several key trends and developments from the quarter, including the evident strength of leasing demand across our footprint and renewed collections volatility in India.\nFirst, we continue to see 4G and 5G investments driving strong demand across our footprint, which translated into solid gross leasing growth in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue and further accelerate particularly in the U.S. as we approach 2023. We complemented sequential growth in organic leasing with nearly 1,600 newly constructed sites internationally earning on average, low double-digit returns on day 1, driven by those same trends.\nAdditionally, demand for hybrid IT solutions optimally suited for our U.S. data center portfolio remains healthy. This resulted in another strong quarter of leasing results, fueled by digital platforms and the continuation of enterprises moving their IT infrastructure from on-premises to interconnection-rich co-location facilities with direct cloud access, such as CoreSite.\nNext, we closed on Stonepeak's initial $2.5 billion investment in our U.S. data center business in August which was upsized by another $570 million after quarter end at the same valuation in terms. This further highlights the differentiated characteristics and value of the CoreSite portfolio while establishing a partnership through which we will execute on our U.S. data center strategy.\nAlso, we signed a new comprehensive MLA with Verizon at the end of August, which is expected to allow Verizon to efficiently accelerate their 5G network deployment over a multiyear period. This agreement is yet another data point, illustrating the fundamental long-term criticality of our portfolio as our customers seek to leverage our scale and capabilities to rapidly deploy nationwide 5G and further provides tangible evidence that our U.S. business should have a solid runway of growth over the next several years.\nAdditionally, we executed a new multimarket MLA with Airtel Africa, our largest customer in the region. Under this new long-term agreement, we've secured attractive terms across our existing Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Niger portfolio along with a contractually committed, attractive build-to-suit pipeline to support Airtel Africa's 5G deployment, among other opportunities.\nImportantly, with Airtel Africa, we share a focus on advancing wireless connectivity in a sustainable manner, which is represented in this agreement through a commitment to deploy low-carbon sites and expand our digital communities program. Our agreements with both Verizon and Airtel Africa, 2 of our largest customers is the latest demonstration of the value our global scale and operational capabilities as a company, both in markets and across borders, can unlock to provide mutually beneficial solutions for American Tower and our partners.\nWith that, I'd like to take a moment to address some uncertainty related to collections arising out of our India operations and how this event has affected our results for Q3 and revised outlook for 2022. In Q3, collections from Vodafone Idea or VIL, fell short of our billings. And the customer has also communicated an expectation for that trend to continue through the balance of this year. As a result, we found it prudent to take certain reserves associated with VIL in Q3 and against the anticipated Q4 billing shortfall in our revised guidance.\nConsequently, our full year expectations now include approximately $95 million in additional revenue reserves, about half of which was booked in Q3. It also includes the removal of a $30 million bad debt reversal that was assumed in our prior guidance. Together, these result in a reduction in adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO of $125 million.\nAt this time, our revised outlook for net income does not assume any additional impairment charges associated with the goodwill and intangibles that we currently have on the books associated with VIL as the shortfall in cash flows is being viewed as temporary. It should also be noted that VIL did express a commitment to revert back to 100% payment at the start of 2023 and repay outstanding pass-through balances, which could potentially provide an opportunity to reverse certain reserves we've taken in the future.\nVIL has also laid out a set of strategic steps that we will closely monitor on its path to more stabilized and consistent payment including the conversion of its AGR interest into equity held by the Indian government. However, until then, we expect continued uncertainty in collections for VIL and I have reflected those risks in our revised outlook. In the meantime, we are actively working with VIL on the path forward, which could potentially include converting a portion of its existing AR into optionally convertible notes, which we believe can better secure our receivables. We will incorporate new developments that unfold over the next several months into our guidance for 2023 on this February's call.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q3 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our Q3 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion increased by over 10% and over 14% on an FX-neutral basis as compared to the prior year period. Growth was primarily driven by solid organic leasing, execution on our international new build program in contributions from our U.S. data center business, partially offset by headwinds of approximately 2% associated with revenue reserves taken in India during the quarter, as discussed, and another 2% from Sprint related churn.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, as expected, net organic growth was slightly positive at 0.3%, including a sequential step-up in gross organic new business of $38 million, a meaningful acceleration from $31 million in Q2 in our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020.\nAs we have indicated throughout the year, we expect this acceleration to continue into Q4 and even further in 2023, where a large portion of our growth will be contractually committed through our comprehensive MLAs. Escalators were 2.8%, which, consistent with last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends.\nThis growth was offset by the impact of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwinds year-over-year and will step down in Q4 as the largest tranche of contractual Sprint churn will have lapped in our year-over-year growth metric.\nOn the international side, organic growth was 6.1%. Starting with Europe, we saw growth of 6%, which is now at a more normalized level with Telxius largely in the prior year base. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 6.8%, modestly higher than prior expectations due to some delays in anticipated churn, now pushed to later in the year. Growth also included another strong quarter of gross organic new business standing at 7.5%, putting Africa on track for its best organic new business year on record, and continuing past quarter trends, we saw the strong organic leasing activity complemented with an active new build program constructing just over 250 sites in the quarter as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns on our capital deployments across the region.\nMoving to Latin America. Organic growth was 8.2%, which includes approximately 9.7% from escalations. Growth through organic new business and escalations was partially offset by another quarter of elevated churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreement, which we expect to further accelerate in Q4 as highlighted on previous earnings calls.\nIn APAC, we saw organic growth of 1.9%, in line with our expectations, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with 1,200 sites constructed during the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 6% or over 8.5% on an FX-neutral basis to over $1.6 billion with strong revenue growth and cost controls, partially offset by the negative impacts of Vodafone Idea revenue reserves and Sprint related churn, together representing approximately 6% headwinds to growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 61.5%, down 170 basis points year-over-year driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint churn along with higher pass-through revenue resulting from fuel costs.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share decreased by approximately 3% and 5%, respectively, with each including a 3% headwind associated with FX. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint related churn, combining for an over 8% offset to otherwise strong and resilient performance across our global operations.\nLet's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, performance remains solid across our portfolio as demand for wireless connectivity and the rollout of next-generation networks are fueling strong new business volumes across our regions. Together with the straight-line benefit from our recently executed MLAs along with pass-through increases primarily related to power and fuel, we're raising our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year.\nSecond, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in outlook to outlook headwind of $45 million, $22 million and $13 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO, respectively.\nFinally, and as noted earlier, we have incorporated approximately $125 million in incremental reserves relative to our prior outlook associated with Vodafone Idea. This includes $95 million in revenue reserves split between Q3 and Q4 and the removal of our previous assumption for incremental bad debt reversals of around $30 million. As I mentioned, Vodafone Idea has communicated its intention to resume full recurring payments in 2023. However, at this time, we believe these adjustments to be appropriate for the current year.\nWith that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $70 million at the midpoint. This outperformance includes straight-line upside of approximately $65 million, primarily associated with our recently executed Verizon and Airtel Africa MLAs and $77 million in higher pass-through revenue driven by fuel costs, along with various nonrecurring benefits, including accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, which we now expect to total approximately $85 million for the full year.\nOur guidance raise was also supported by a recurring revenue upside across several of our segments helping to contribute to some modest revisions to our organic tenant billings growth outlook, which I'll touch on shortly. This outperformance was partially offset by the $95 million in incremental revenue reserves related to Vodafone Idea and $45 million in FX.\nMoving to Slide 9, you will see our organic tenant billings growth expectations. While we are reiterating our prior outlook on a consolidated basis and for the U.S. and Canada as well as APAC segment, we are slightly revising our expectations for International, Europe, Latin America and Africa.\nFor international, we are raising our organic growth to approximately 6.5%, up from approximately 6% previously. In Europe, we have adjusted our organic growth expectations to greater than 8% from approximately 9% in our prior outlook, where we expect new business commencements to shift further into 2023.\nIn Latin America, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up modestly from approximately 7% in our prior guidance, reflecting a continuation of the CPI-linked escalation benefits in the region. In Africa, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up from approximately 6.5% in our prior guidance, reflecting the delays we're seeing in anticipated churn, as I mentioned earlier.\nAs a reminder, in Latin America and Africa, consistent with prior assumptions, we anticipate consolidation-driven churn events to drive a sequential decline in growth as we exit the year resulting in what we expect to be approximately 4% and 5.5% organic tenant billings growth in Q4, respectively, with some carryover impacts as we head into 2023.\nLastly, in the U.S. and Canada, where we are reiterating our prior organic growth outlook, we expect to see Q4 organic tenant billings growth of around 4%, with further improvement in 2023, backstopped by the contractual visibility afforded through our comprehensive MLAs with the big 3 carriers plus DISH.\nMoving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA midpoint by $30 million as compared to our prior outlook, where we're seeing a high conversion of property revenue outperformance delivered through prudent cost controls and continued elevated services volumes, providing meaningful upside as compared to our previous expectations. These benefits are partially offset by the $125 million associated with incremental reserves assumed for Vodafone Idea, as previously discussed along with $22 million in FX.\nTurning to Slide 11. We are lowering our attributable AFFO guidance by $40 million or $0.09 on a per share basis. This adjustment is attributable to the Vodafone Idea reserves we have taken, which is translating into approximately $0.27 per share of downside, offsetting what was otherwise very strong performance across our business, which represented approximately $0.20 per share outperformance on an FX-neutral basis.\nMoving to Slide 12. Let's start by taking a look at our capital deployment expectations for the year, which are slightly updated compared to our prior outlook and continue to reflect our focus on driving sustained AFFO per share growth and shareholder returns. Within our capital deployment plan, we are reiterating our expectations to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion, subject to Board approval towards our 2022 dividend.\nWith regard to CapEx, we are reducing our total midpoint by $45 million, with redevelopment decreasing by $35 million and start-up decreasing by $10 million, the result of some timing adjustments and savings as compared to our prior plan. We continue to assume the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites globally and roughly $300 million towards our U.S. data center business, largely associated with development spend.\nAs we've highlighted in the past, we continue to generate exceptional returns through our discretionary CapEx program, which remains largely financed through the redeployment of locally generated cash flows. We view our ability to allocate nearly $1.8 billion towards accretive high-yield projects as a strategic benefit after years of building scale and credibility with our global customer base in a compelling way to further build scale and drive accretion for years to come.\nFinally, although we have not incorporated into our revised guide, I'd like to highlight that with the additional capacity we currently have as we outpace our delevering plan, we expect to opportunistically restart our share buyback program. Given recent market performance and the strong fundamentals we anticipate in our business over the long term, we see this as a great opportunity to further drive shareholder value, particularly against other forms of capital deployment in our current line of sight.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, I'd like to take a moment to review the progress we have made since the start of the year to shore up our balance sheet and liquidity position, particularly in light of the market volatility and unprecedented rise in rates occurring over the past several months.\nAs you recall, we closed the CoreSite acquisition using our bank facilities and term loans, temporarily moving our leverage to 6.8x and our floating rate exposure to 31% at the end of 2021. Since that time and against the challenging backdrop, we have strategically termed out short-term borrowings through common equity, private capital and senior unsecured note offerings, all at solid terms and pricing. Today, our leverage stands at 5.5x ahead of plan with floating rate exposure of around 20%, in line with our long-term target.\nLooking ahead, we continue to believe this profile is appropriate given the predictable and contractual nature of our cash flows while providing us exposure to prepayable debt, which offers us financial flexibility as we execute on our delevering path, and access to the typical low rate short-term curve. In addition, a meaningful portion of our floating rate debt is euro denominated, which provides us a natural hedge and diversified capital structure while also offering prepayable debt at terms more competitive than those currently available in the U.S.\nAlthough we anticipate 2023 as it appears today, we'll present certain growth challenges stemming from the current rate environment, we feel comfortable with our proven approach to balance sheet management. This includes our ability to manage our upcoming 2023 maturities where we expect our diversified sources of capital and solid liquidity position to provide near-term financing flexibility, allowing us to opportunistically access the markets against a healthy and constructive backdrop.\nIn short, we believe our investment-grade balance sheet and the long-standing policies we've established position us well to navigate various economic cycles, including the challenges we're all facing today. And although we may see certain growth headwinds in the near term, we believe our investment-grade credit rating and continued access to diversified sources of capital coupled with our focus on maintaining robust liquidity will serve as a more meaningful competitive advantage over the next several years.\nFinally, on Slide 13. And in summary, we had a strong Q3 across our global business with solid operating performance, accelerated leasing and resilient demand even in the face of a challenging economic backdrop. During the quarter, the long-term critical nature of our portfolio of assets in positioning to drive sustained and compelling growth was further highlighted through key customer agreements with Verizon and Airtel Africa and the closing and subsequent upsizing of our Stonepeak partnership in our U.S. data center business.\nAlthough we will likely experience some growth pressure in the near term associated with the continued rise in interest rates, we see our investment-grade balance sheet, liquidity and diversified sources of capital as a key competitive advantage as we execute on our growth strategy over the next decade and beyond.\nAs we look ahead and over the long term, we are excited about the positioning of our global portfolio of communications assets as our customers augment and extend their networks to meet exploding data-driven demand and believe our global scale and proven capabilities have us positioned to drive incremental sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.",

Welcome to the American Tower Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of IR, American Tower Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nOn this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our international business; and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q2 2022 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include: our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition, including the closing of our Stonepeak minority investment and our U.S. data center business; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone.\nIn line with our historical practice for our second quarter earnings call, my comments today will be focused on American Tower's international business. Before diving into the trends that we see driving a long runway of growth in our international segment, I'd like to take a moment to review the principles that have underpinned our international expansion strategy over the last 2 decades.\nSince we first started expanding outside of the United States, entering Mexico and Brazil in 1999 and 2000, respectively, we've been guided by the belief that the secular demand trends and fundamentals of the tower business model that would drive tremendous value in the U.S. over a multi-decade period would be replicated internationally. Central to this thesis was at the anticipated proliferation of wireless networks and resulting rapid growth in mobile data demand would necessitate neutral host shared wireless infrastructure across the globe. We also believe that by leveraging our core capabilities developed here in the United States, we could position American Tower as a premier global provider of communications real estate and a prime beneficiary of these trends. Further, given the relative lack of fixed line infrastructure, accelerating population growth and earlier stages of network technology evolution in many parts of the world, we believe we could both augment and extend our overall consolidated growth trajectory.\nSo we set out to construct a geographically diverse platform of communication assets in the world's largest democratic economies while establishing relationships with the leading global wireless carriers, achieved primarily through the acquisition of high-quality portfolios with compelling underlying organic growth and risk-adjusted return profiles. We then sought to leverage our scale, customer relationships and capabilities to execute on high-return new build opportunities and innovative solutions like Power as a Service that has strengthened our competitive positioning and supported our customers in meeting their network needs, all while driving increasing shareholder value.\nAs a result of these efforts, today, our global platform includes an international portfolio that fits in over 170,000 sites and contributes approximately 45% of our property revenues and approximately 36% of our property segment operating profit.\nFocusing in our international new build program for a moment, we've constructed approximately 40,000 sites since launching our international operations over 2 decades ago, with just over 22,000 of those sites being built since the start of 2018 alone. We credit this recent acceleration to our enhanced market positioning ahead of major network deployments, demonstrated operational capabilities and strong cross-national MNO partnerships, all afforded through previous strategic M&A expansion initiatives. In total, these 40,000 American Tower built sites are driving an attractive NOI yield of 25%, owing to the strong demand we've seen for our infrastructure and the operating leverage inherent to the shared tower model across the globe. [At sites] looking forward, we'll continue driving toward our ambition to add another 40,000 to 50,000 sites to our international portfolio over the next several years.\nWith that, let's take a few minutes to discuss each of our international regions and the key trends developing across our footprint.\nFirst, I'll touch on Europe. We have a portfolio of over 30,000 sites and strong scaled positions in Germany and Spain which are benefiting from many of the same trends, driving strong growth in the United States, including the early stage of 5G rollouts and a new entrant. As many of you know, we've taken a consistently measured approach to achieving scale in the continent. We started through a modest acquisition in Germany in 2012. We then spent the better part of the following decade evaluating various opportunities through our disciplined approach to capital allocation, which led to our entry into France in 2017 and later a small-scale entry to Poland.\nHowever, it wasn't until the Telxius transaction in 2021 that we found an opportunity to add significant scale through a portfolio that met the standards of our global underwriting framework. These characteristics include high-quality, strategically-located assets that stand to benefit from continued network investments in attractive contractual terms and conditions, such as CPI-based escalators which act as a natural hedge against local inflation, along with a low churn profile, which taken together drive compelling risk-adjusted returns for American Tower and our shareholders.\nFrom a timing perspective, we couldn't be happier with our acquisition of the Telxius Tower portfolio. Across Germany and Spain, we've seen several quarters of accelerating activity as carriers begin lighting up low and mid-band spectrum with new 5G equipment while continuing to invest to support growth data consumption on their existing 4G networks. At the same time, in Germany, new entrant 1&1 is rolling out a greenfield 5G network, and we believe our portfolio of nearly 15,000 sites primarily located in urban centers across the country is in a strong position to support their network build. Earlier this year, we signed a framework agreement with 1&1 through which we can provide value to the carrier while benefiting from incremental growth associated with the relationship for many years to come.\nAs a result of these factors, we're seeing strong leasing activity on our assets. as well as demand for new builds, particularly in white and gray spot areas where carriers are working to meet coverage requirements and provide critical connectivity in areas that have historically been underserved.\nIn 2022, we plan to double our previous record and build approximately 400 sites across Europe, and we expect this trend of elevated new build activities to continue. Thanks to the demand driven by such initiatives, the pipeline secured through the Telxius transaction and our position as a leading independent tower operator on the continent with a global reputation for operational excellence.\nWith that, let's turn to our regions that are in relatively earlier stages of network technology and where we see an opportunity to capitalize on a strong persistent demand environment for an extended period. There's probably no region where the benefits of local scale and the operational expertise gained as a premier independent operator are more pronounced than in Africa, where we're seeing these benefits play out across essentially every facet of the business.\nIn recent years, we've seen the proliferation of affordable smart devices and consumer uptake of mobile application use cases drive outsized growth in mobile data usage, and our multinational carrier customers across the region have been working to roll out and enhance their 4G networks in response. For ATC Africa, this has resulted in average organic tenant billings growth in the high single-digit range over the last several years, coupled with 5 consecutive years of record new build activity. This trend has continued unabated into 2022, and as a result, we've built over 1,000 sites across Africa in the first half alone, up over 30% compared to the first half of 2021 and nearly double the volumes achieved in the same period in 2020. These sites continue to demonstrate very attractive average day 1 NOI yields with our year-to-date builds producing more than 13%, and we expect to continue to execute on opportunities to add critical scale and earn strong returns in key markets throughout the region over the next several years.\nWhile the trends supporting a strong growth environment in the region are expected to persist, there are operational challenges to create unique opportunities in the African market, particularly in the context of the global supply chain disruptions, power grid availability and reliability and ongoing macro volatility. It's here that the scale of our African business, the shared learnings of a global organization and an entrenched culture of innovation have resulted in a resilient differentiated business across the region. For example, we've been able to leverage global supply chain learnings from the peak of the pandemic as well as the resources afforded by our investment-grade balance sheet and strong international cash flows to produce materials for our new build program several quarters in advance. Not only does this result in cost savings in an inflationary environment, but also derisk operational challenges in a core sector of high-yield [growth] for American Tower while bolstering our reputation as a preferred partner, who is capable of delivering new sites when we say we're going to.\nThis forward-thinking approach to the procurement of critical resources has also been applied to an area of our Africa business that we are perhaps most proud of, our power program, where we've accelerated our innovative efforts across the region in recent years. To date, we've deployed roughly $300 million in the region to equip nearly 16,000 sites with the capability to source power from renewables and more energy-efficient resources including lithium-ion batteries and solar arrays. Entered a new build program where we're working towards making the majority of our newly constructed towers operationally 0 or near 0 greenhouse gas emission sites.\nIn fact, as of the end of the second quarter, we've installed lithium-ion batteries and solar panels at nearly 70% and over 40% of our sites in the region, respectively, which has driven a reduction in our reliance on fossil fuel power generators, accommodated our potential to increasingly rely on intermittent renewable sources and supported our progress toward meeting our GHG emission reduction targets.\nMore recently, we've been able to leverage our position in the region to form a strategic partnership with a vendor in our energy supply chain. This alliance brings product assembly to the region as we look to augment our delivery of environmentally and economically sustainable power solutions in our sites, where power availability and access to efficient and reliable sources can often be a challenge. Additionally, this local partnership will facilitate the acceleration of our progress towards meeting our emission targets, reducing our supply chain risk, lowering the overall carbon footprint and cost of our procurement process and supporting the local economy and the communities we serve, which we are particularly proud of.\nNow, let's turn to Latin America. It was our first region of international expansion and where we've seen upper single-digit average organic tenant billings growth over the last several years. On a consolidated basis, our nearly 49,000 sites earning a double-digit NOI yield in our earlier vintage in the region, which consists of assets built or acquired prior to 2010, we're seeing a U.S. dollar yield of over 40%. Today, MNOs in the region are in advanced stages of 4G and in the early innings of 5G network deployments, driving a significant need for additional cell sites. As a result, we continue to see solid activity on our existing sites as well as growth through new infrastructure to improve both coverage and capacity.\nAlthough we expect to see the ongoing effects of industry restructuring impact net organic growth in the midterm, we believe the portfolio we've developed across the continent over the last 2 decades will be critical for our customers as they continue to invest in their networks.\nLooking at Brazil specifically, our largest market in the region in terms of site count [for] revenue, we're seeing the final stages of a consolidation process that has resulted in transfer of network assets in the hands of large multinational operators, with the capabilities and financial firepower to build out enhanced next-generation networks on a nationwide basis. Further, with the 5G auction now complete, our local scale positions American Tower as a strategic partner to our customers as they transform their networks while allowing us to maximize the opportunities provided by consolidation and increased carrier investment obligations.\nAlthough we're at the very early stages of a network upgrade investment cycle, we're already seeing incremental demand for our infrastructure, capturing a large share of the initial urban amendment cycle. We expect this amendment cycle to be followed by a period of new site deployments aimed at improving capacity and performance similar to the cadence we anticipate in the U.S. over the course of the next decade, which should translate to solid growth for American Tower in the region over a multiyear period.\nFinally, let's turn to Asia Pacific. Our portfolio in the region predominantly consists of our scaled footprint across India as well as our more recently-established presence in the Philippines and Bangladesh, where we've leveraged our management and site deployment expertise to prudently evaluate opportunities in the region through high-yield build programs, resulting in over 400 sites being constructed across the 2 markets combined year-to-date.\nIn India, we continue to be encouraged by the improvements in market structure, carrier health and government reforms aimed at easing the near-term financial burden of operators and ensuring a multiplayer competitive ecosystem, all of which is driving incrementally constructive trends across the communications infrastructure landscape. And with the carrier consolidation cycle and associated elevated churn largely complete, our full year outlook includes an expectation for positive organic tenant billings growth in the region for the first time in several years.\nWhile challenges certainly remain in the market and we could see some variability in growth from period to period, our optimism around the longer-term opportunity presented in India remains. With an attractive backdrop of a growing population of over 1.4 billion people that's driving accelerated mobile data usage and the government is demonstrating a commitment to a digital transformation of the economy, we see a need for thousands of new cell sites to serve 4G and eventually future 5G networks. We expect these catalysts to drive a period of sustained attractive gross growth as well as the continued acceleration of our new build program, where we're seeing low to mid-double-digit day 1 NOI yields on average. And taken together with a moderating churn environment, we remain optimistic that India and the Asia Pacific region can be a solid contributor toward achieving our longer-term growth targets on a consolidated basis.\nIn summary, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across our international footprint with an acceleration in mobile data consumption driving sustained customer investments on current and next-generation networks globally. Over the past 2 decades, we followed a consistent and disciplined approach to market and asset selection, demonstrated a consistent track record of operational excellence and developed a scaled presence and strong customer partnerships across a geographically diverse and globally distributed footprint, which we believe places us at a distinct competitive advantage in a 5G world and beyond.\nWhile we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further enhance our scale through the same disciplined lens, we remain focused on leveraging our position and capabilities to drive incremental value across our served markets. We believe our well-balanced international platform, combined with our highly-complementary foundational U.S. business, provides American Tower with an unmatched global portfolio that's optimally positioned to benefit from multiple network technology evolutions and digital transformation opportunities for many years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Rod to take you through our latest quarterly results and updated outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call.\nAs you saw in today's press release, we delivered another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before walking through the details of our Q2 results and revised outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter along with the financing initiatives we've executed over the last several months.\nFirst, we've announced and partially closed our plans to raise approximately $4.8 billion in equity financing in support of our CoreSite acquisition, beginning with our common equity issuance in early June and later through our announced agreement with Stonepeak in our U.S. data center business. With these 2 transactions, not only have we addressed our equity financing requirement for CoreSite but we've accomplished it in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and supports our investment-grade credit ratings. Further, through our partnership with Stonepeak who brings tremendous expertise in communications infrastructure and has a like-minded long-term investment philosophy, we've created a platform to further evaluate and finance growth opportunities across our U.S. data center business as the 5G ecosystem further develops.\nMoreover, we believe Stonepeak's investment represents a full valuation relative to what we have invested in our U.S. data center portfolio today, and allows American Tower to retain operational control as well as the flexibility to execute on our mobile edge strategy. I'll discuss this transaction in more detail later.\nSecond, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet by leveraging the debt capital markets, raising $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at attractive terms. As a result of our Q2 financing activities and pro forma for our private capital proceeds, which we expect to use to pay down short-term floating rate debt, we will increase our percentage of fixed debt to nearly 80%, up from 66% as of the end of Q1, and bring pro forma net leverage down to approximately 5.5x. With our CoreSite financing now largely complete, we remain committed to organically delevering back below 5x over the next couple of years.\nThird, we see strong secular trends driving increased network coverage and densification initiatives among our customers, continuing to translate solid gross new business globally, including the need for more cell sites internationally as Tom just highlighted, evidenced by the success of our new build program. We constructed over 1,500 sites in Q2, representing the 12th quarter of over 1,000 new builds since the start of 2019, a demonstration of the success of our capabilities and expertise, scaled market positions and strong customer relationships.\nAdditionally, demand remains robust for our differentiated interconnection-rich U.S. data center campuses as customers leverage the dynamically scalable solutions and interoperability provided by CoreSite's national ecosystem, leading to another strong quarter of new and expansion leasing.\nAnd finally, our first half performance and confidence in our full year outlook and long-term targets amid heightened market volatility, rising inflation and operational challenges is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the stability of the earnings we consistently generate. This is made possible through operational excellence and service dependability. Our investment-grade balance sheet, the strength of our underlying contracts, including international revenues supported by CPI-linked escalators, the ability to pass through a substantial portion of our direct costs across our international regions and the matching of escalator terms in the U.S. between customer and land leases, and more importantly, the mobile data trends driving unabated demand for our communications assets.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our Q2 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by over 17% and nearly 19% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue was roughly flat due to the continued effects of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 19% or nearly 23%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and includes about 12% contributed by the Telxius assets. In addition, our U.S. data center business contributed nearly $190 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates are indicative of the strong secular demand drivers that underpin growth on our communications infrastructure assets across the globe as 4G and 5G deployments continue.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, as expected, organic growth was slightly negative at 0.4%, including a sequential step down in gross organic new business on a dollar basis associated with the timing of certain MLA use fee commencements in 2021, which we guided to during our Q1 call. We continue to expect a reacceleration in gross new business in the back half of the year.\nEscalators were 2.8%, which, as we also highlighted last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impacts of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwind year-over-year.\nOn the international side, organic growth was 7.8%. Starting with Europe, we saw growth of 11.2%, which remains elevated given contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which were only partially included in our Q2 2021 base. Absent Telxius, our legacy European business grew roughly 6%, an expansion of approximately 160 basis points as compared to our Q2 2021 growth rates.\nIn Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 9%, which includes 8% in gross organic new business contributions, our highest quarter on record. The continued strength in new leasing activity in the region was complemented by the construction of just over 400 sites in the quarter. As we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns across the region.\nMoving to Latin America. Organic growth was 8.3%, which includes approximately 8.7% from escalations. Consistent gross organic leasing growth was offset by expected elevated churn, primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements as highlighted on previous earnings calls.\nFor both Africa and Latin America, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect a step down relative to the first half in net organic growth rates due to anticipated consolidation-driven churn, which remains consistent with our prior outlook assumptions.\nIn APAC, we saw organic growth of 3.9%, in line with our expectations and representing our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with nearly 1,000 sites constructed during the quarter. It's important to note that although we remain encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing in our APAC growth rates, we do anticipate a modest sequential step down in Q3 to the low single-digit range before recovering in Q4 to near the upper end of our 2% to 3% full year guide, which remains unchanged.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew just over 13% or over 14% on an FX-neutral basis to approximately $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.5%, down 170 basis points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced Sprint churn, along with higher pass-through revenue resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 7% and 5%, respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by Sprint churn and the timing of cash taxes, which together provided a negative headwind of nearly 7%.\nLet's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, our core operating performance remained strong across our business, allowing us to raise our AFFO per share guidance for the year and increase our expectations on an FX-neutral basis for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology which has resulted in outlook-to-outlook headwinds of approximately $100 million, nearly $50 million, $40 million and roughly $0.08 for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share, respectively.\nFinally, we have updated our CoreSite financing assumptions to reflect our completed common equity issuance and our anticipated close of private capital funding. This update has resulted in a reduction in our total equity requirement, balanced with the incremental debt and associated interest costs. Additionally, we have contemplated the minority interest impacts related to the Stonepeak partnership and updated closing assumptions, all of which I will address in more detail in a moment.\nWith that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are continuing to project consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint. The $15 million decrease relative to prior guidance is driven by the FX headwinds I previously mentioned, which were partially offset by over $40 million in core property revenue outperformance. Taking the benefits of CPI in our international escalators and accelerated decommissioning-related settlements, together with upside in our U.S. and Canada and data center segments and over $40 million in other outperformance primarily driven by higher international pass-through revenue due to elevated fuel costs.\nMoving to Slide 9, you will see our organic tenant billings growth projections, which have been slightly revised since our last earnings call. While our expectations remain consistent in the U.S. and Canada, international and on a consolidated basis, we have made some adjustments within our specific international segments. In Europe, we have adjusted our growth back to approximately 9%, reflecting our expectations for a temporary shift in new business commencement timing from the back half of 2022 into 2023. Demand remains very solid in the region, setting us up well as we exit 2022. You will also see that we have modestly raised the guidance for Latin America to approximately 7% and Africa to approximately 6.5%, both up from previous expectations of greater than 6%, reflecting a continuation of escalation benefits from CPI.\nMoving to Slide 10, we are lowering our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million as compared to our prior outlook, driven again by negative FX impacts, with expected growth of approximately 10% year-over-year. While we are seeing a strong conversion of core property revenue upside to cash margin outperformance, we have taken a revised view on SG&A, notably on bad debt reversal expectations for the year. Although collection trends were solid in Q2, we have pushed out some of our assumptions related to the incremental collections associated with previously reserved balances that we continue to expect to collect in time.\nTurning to Slide 11. We are raising our attributable AFFO per share guidance to $9.74, up from $9.72, despite absorbing the negative effects from FX and a continued rise in interest rates. To better understand the components in our revised outlook bridge, I'd like to spend a moment to walk through the moving pieces of the guidance associated with our updated equity plan and the mechanics of our Stonepeak partnership, which consists of $1.75 billion in common equity and $750 million in mandatory convertible preferred equity for a total ownership interest of 29% on a fully convertible basis in our U.S. data center business.\nFirst, as I mentioned, we were able to reduce our total equity requirements from approximately $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion, including $2.3 billion of common equity proceeds, which meaningfully reduced our share issuance to approximately 9.2 million shares. The reduction in equity resulted in an increase to our debt balances which, together with the revised timing of the equity raise along with the elevated interest rates, has driven an increase to our interest expense look, which largely makes up the over $50 million other reduction to AFFO as compared to our prior outlook.\nNext, regarding our Stonepeak partnership, the financial impacts for the [minority] investment will appear in 2 places. First, the coupon of $750 million of mandatorily convertible preferred equity with a cost in the mid-single-digit percent range will be recognized as a deduction to the AFFO generated by our data center segment and reflected in our consolidated AFFO, which represents approximately $14 million in our 2022 guide, as shown on the slide.\nSecond, until conversion of their preferred equity, which is expected to occur 4 years from the date of closing, Stonepeak's initial common equity stake in our data center business will stand at 23%, which contemplates approximately $2 billion of net debt on the U.S. data center business and will be considered as a minority interest deduction for attributable AFFO purposes, equating to approximately $20 million in our 2022 outlook. Please note, we have also reduced the European minority interest assumption from $160 million previously to $150 million, largely due to FX. Together, we are now guiding to a minority interest adjustment of $170 million in 2022.\nFinally, -- as I mentioned earlier, our updated outlook also takes into consideration updated equity closing assumptions. We previously assumed a May closing for our common equity issuance, which actually occurred in early June. We also assumed our private capital will close in mid-Q3, with planned proceeds to be used to pay down short-term floating rate debt. Taken all together, our revised CoreSite financing plan drove approximately $0.06 of incremental accretion relative to our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook, which includes a negative hit of roughly $0.03, driven by higher interest rates on our debt financing relative to our previous assumptions.\nMoving to Slide 12. Let's look at our capital deployment expectations for 2022, which are updated compared to our prior outlook while continuing to reflect our focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. First, we now expect to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion subject to Board approval towards our 2022 dividends. This is down slightly from our previous guidance of $2.8 billion, which is simply a function of our reduced common equity issuance and continues to represent approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth on a per share basis. In regards to CapEx, we are decreasing our outlook midpoint by $60 million in total, with development CapEx increasing $15 million and with redevelopment capital and land acquisition spend decreasing $25 million and $50 million, respectively.\nOur development plan continues to assume the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites globally at attractive returns. In fact, on the nearly 3,000 sites constructed in the first half of 2022, we saw a day 1 NOI yield of roughly 14%. Lastly, we continue to expect to direct roughly $300 million towards our U.S. data center business, largely associated with development spend.\nNow turning to Slide 13. And with our CoreSite financing plan largely complete, I will briefly touch on the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet, which is fundamental to the execution of our Stand and Deliver strategy. Our long-stated financial policies, including establishing optimal levels of leverage and an appropriate mix of debt instruments, guide the management of our capital structure. Which, together with our strong business fundamentals, provide American Tower with continued access to capital markets at attractive terms.\nAs you recall, American Tower proactively accessed the debt capital markets in 2021, taking advantage of historically low pricing, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes in the second half of the year at a blended cost of approximately 1.6%. With our fixed debt percentage at the time rising to over 85%, this effectively allowed us to lock in low-rate debt for future strategic initiatives, including the CoreSite acquisition, which in turn reduced our dependency on the debt markets in 2022 as part of our final financing plan.\nWe believe the strategic and efficient management of our balance sheet puts us in a strong position as we close out 2022 and look beyond. As of the end of the second quarter, a pro forma for the close of the Stonepeak investment in our U.S. data center business, our average cost of debt stands at about 2.6% with an average remaining tenure of over 6 years. Since 2010, we have reduced our average cost of debt by approximately 250 basis points and increased our average debt tenure by about 1 year by accessing the long part of the yield curve, proactively refinancing our debt and capitalizing on low rate environments.\nIn addition, and more recently, we also focused on diversifying and expanding our capital sources and structure by issuing euro-denominated debt, establishing our ATM program, and efficiently executing on public equity raises and partnership agreements with leading global private investors.\nWith a strong liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion on a pro forma basis, inclusive of Stonepeak proceeds and other financing activities subsequent to the quarter end, in a staggered maturity profile, we feel well positioned moving forward as we focus on organically deleveraging back to within our normal net leverage range over the next couple of years.\nTaken all together, we see the strength of our financial position as a competitive advantage for American Tower, whether executing on our growth strategy, navigating economic downturns or volatility in the financial markets, and we remain focused on and committed to our thoughtfully-established financial policies that have guided our financial strategy for the past decade.\nFinally, on Slide 14 and in summary, Q2 was another solid quarter supported by leasing demand across our global portfolio of communications assets, strong execution of capital markets initiatives including financing for the CoreSite acquisition, and meaningful, high-yielding new asset development activity. Our high-quality set of assets and established market positions continue to benefit from secular demand trends driving 4G and 5G initiatives across our global footprint, while the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows has us well positioned to manage and grow the business through potential market volatility and uncertainty. As we look to the back half of the year, we are excited about our growth trajectory and remain focused on executing on our strategic initiatives, which support our long-term double-digit AFFO growth aspirations.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.",

Welcome to the American Tower First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nSVP of IR, American Tower Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nOn this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. business. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2022 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.\nYou should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Adam, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning.\nIn line with our traditional first quarter practice, my comments on this call will primarily focus on our core U.S. and Canadian tower business. which, together with our U.S.-based data center segment, made up approximately 54% of our total property revenues and 65% of our total property segment operating profit in the first quarter.\nGrowth in our foundational U.S. and Canadian business continues to be propelled by the rapid acceleration in mobile data consumption that we've seen over the last decade plus. Back in 2017, the average smartphone in the U.S. was consuming roughly 6 gigabytes of data per month. And today, in the early stages of 5G uptake by consumers, that number has grown by a staggering 240% to over 20 gigabytes on a monthly basis, as both 5G handsets and coverage become increasingly pervasive. This upward trend is expected to continue, with industry estimates now forecasting an average monthly consumption rate of 54 gigabytes by 2027.\nTo meet this expected demand, carriers are aggressively deploying mid-band spectrum to provide ubiquitous 5G mobile services. Historically, annual carrier CapEx in the U.S. has grown by approximately $5 billion to $6 billion, with every new G as MNOs deploy capital to maintain service quality on their increasingly strained networks and provide incremental capacity and density to meet consumer demand for enhanced network performance.\nEarly evidence in the 5G cycle suggests this will continue to be the case. In fact, in 2021, we saw carriers increase aggregate CapEx to approximately $34 billion, up from the roughly $30 billion annually we saw during the 4G cycle. An independent industry report suggests that this number should continue in the $35 billion range on average going forward.\nFurther, as we've seen with prior network technology deployments, we expect a prolonged 5G investment cycle that will extend over the next decade. Today, carriers are in the earlier stages of upgrading sites with new equipment to provide broad, contiguous 5G coverage across their respective subscriber bases. And given the propagation characteristics of mid-band spectrum and ever-increasing mobile consumption, paired with incremental low latency requirements arising from 5G-enabled use cases, we would expect an extended period of investment aimed at delivering greater cell site density and stronger performance across networks for many years to come.\nImportantly, it is clear that macro towers will continue to be crucial infrastructure for the long runway of carrier network investments that lie ahead. Macro sites have historically been the most cost-effective means for carriers to provide broad-based network coverage to the vast majority of the U.S. populous, and evidence suggests that remains unchanged in a 5G world.\nTo support this point, over the last 5 years, our backlog of contractually guaranteed revenues in the U.S. has more than doubled on a per site basis. This speaks not only to our team's capacity to secure long-term profitable cash flow growth from our more than 43,000 distributed sites, but also to the long-term value our tenants place on our macro tower assets as a critical component of their network deployment strategy for 5G and beyond. These trends, along with the guaranteed growth secured through our comprehensive MLAs, support our expectation for strong growth on our tower assets, both in the near and longer term.\nIn 2022, we expect another year of accelerating gross new business growth in the U.S. and Canada. And as we previously communicated, growth from colocations and amendments is expected to ramp in the back half of the year with the expectation that we'll exit 2022 on a high point. With colocation and amendment contributions accelerating and the impacts of the Sprint churn beginning to come off their peaks, we're well positioned to execute on a return to strong mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth in 2023 and beyond.\nOn the operational front, our U.S. teams remained focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. That allow us to quickly scale up to meet customer needs and maximize the flow-through of top line growth to the bottom line. Over the last few years, we progressed on process and IT initiatives designed to deliver best-in-class cycle times and introduce technology innovations in the field that improve site monitoring and data collection capabilities, while lowering site-level operating costs and providing efficiency benefits for our tenants.\nIn addition, a focus on cost controls has driven cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue in the segment to well below 4% on a consistent basis, a trend we expect to continue in 2022 and beyond. As a result, we've been able to continue extending on the significant operating leverage inherent to the tower business model.\nAt the midpoint of our 2022 outlook, we expect an operating profit margin of 78.8%, representing a 370 basis point expansion in the segment over the last 5 years even while absorbing the significant impacts of Sprint churn more recently. This strong conversion of top line growth to profit margin, combined with the low capital intensity of just over 1% positions our U.S. and Canadian business continue its decades long track record of delivering strong free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond.\nWith that, I'd like to shift gears for a moment to our data center segment, which we expect to benefit from many of the same long-term technological trends that are driving attractive growth in our tower business.\nWe're off to a great start in our first full quarter of ownership of the CoreSite business. In Q1, as expected, the CoreSite team delivered a very strong quarter of new and expansion sales as these interconnection-rich network and cloud-dense data center campuses continued to attract strong demand from enterprises, the cloud, network and IT service providers in key U.S. markets.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue to see accelerating hybrid IT in multi-cloud deployments drive increasing demand for our highly interconnected portfolio, which should result in opportunities to selectively deploy capital toward high-yield development projects.\nAdditionally, as the 5G revolution begins to unlock new capabilities, we're beginning to see incremental deployments resulting from AR/VR, gaming, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other next-generation use cases, which require lower latency. We would only expect this trend to accelerate and drive more demand for our data center campuses over the coming years, while pushing storage and compute requirements further out to the network edge.\nAnd when we combine our differentiated data center portfolio, CSP and network operator relationships with our distributed U.S. macro tower portfolio and long-standing MNO partnerships, we believe we have a significantly enhanced option to create value as the edge evolves over the coming years.\nIn summary, we're more excited than ever for the opportunity to extend on our long track record of strong, profitable growth in the U.S. As the 5G environment continues to take shape, we believe we're uniquely positioned to drive continued long-term value for shareholders, while playing a critical role as an industry leader in this evolving 5G landscape.\nFinally, I'd like to acknowledge the horrific events unfolding in Ukraine today. It's hard for any of us to comprehend the suffering of those affected by this humanitarian crisis. And while we do not have operations or employees in Ukraine, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those we have lost and to all those who continue to be subjected to this crisis. We, like many global organizations, are focused on finding ways to help the millions of people who are suffering, both within the country and those who are now refugees elsewhere. And we will look to join with others to contribute to the relief efforts underway.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated 2022 outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we're off to a great start in 2022, delivering another quarter of strong performance across our global business.\nBefore getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint, evidenced by the sequential acceleration of organic tenant billings growth across each of our reported segments. Additionally, organic leasing activity was complemented with nearly 1,450 newly constructed sites in Q1, our 11th quarter of over 1,000 new builds in the last 3 years, a milestone that was only achieved once prior to 2019.\nSecond, growth from our recently acquired premier assets, Telxius and CoreSite, is at the high end of our initial expectations. As a result, we are modestly raising guidance for Europe organic tenant billings growth and the midpoint of our data center segment revenues.\nAdditionally, in Europe, we recently signed an agreement with 1&1 in Germany, establishing a leasing framework to support their network rollout, which we expect to be another solid catalyst for growth in an already strong leasing market. We believe this further speaks to the quality and strategic positioning of our acquired Telxius assets, the opportune timing of the transaction and our optimism for the future.\nAnd finally, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment-grade balance sheet, and we're able to issue $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes on attractive terms right after the end of the first quarter, with proceeds used to term out a portion of our floating rate debt.\nLooking ahead, and as it relates to our CoreSite financing plan, we continue to explore options that are aimed at maximizing shareholder value, while supporting our investment-grade credit ratings. Consistent with our prior outlook, we are targeting to finance the $10 billion plus purchase price, roughly equally between debt and equity, the latter potentially being satisfied through issuances of common equity, mandatory preferred equity, or other convertible instruments, or private capital, or a well-balanced combination.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by 22% or over 23% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period, which included a contribution of approximately 17% in growth from Telxius and CoreSite.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, property revenue grew under 1% due to the impacts of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 32% or nearly 35%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. Additionally, our newly expanded U.S. data center business contributed over $180 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates across our property segments continue to reflect the essential nature of digital services and our communications real estate throughout our served markets.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, you'll see our organic tenant billings growth for the quarter, with consolidated growth standing at 3%. In the United States and Canada, while growth was 0.6%, we saw an acceleration of gross organic new business on a dollar basis, posting our highest quarter since Q1 2020, resulting in a 3.3% contribution to growth.\nGiven the mechanics of our MLAs and the timing of certain use fees in 2021, we will see a decline in gross organic new business in the second quarter before ramping up in the back half of the year, which was all contemplated in our original 2022 guidance. Escalators were 3.5%, which is also impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was largely offset by the impacts of Sprint churn.\nOn the international side, growth was 7.4%, and we saw improvements across each of our reported segments. Starting with Latin America, growth came in at roughly 8.7%. This includes approximately 8.5% from escalations, which represents an acceleration of 300 basis points as compared to Q4 2021.\nAdditionally, relatively consistent growth organic leasing trends were largely offset by churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements as highlighted on our Q4 2021 earnings call.\nIn Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 8%, which includes 7% in gross organic new business contributions, our second highest quarter on record. This strong new leasing activity was complemented by the construction of over 600 sites in the quarter, as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns across the region.\nWe have now constructed over 3,800 sites in Africa since the start of 2020, around the time we closed the Eaton Tower transaction, which meaningfully augmented our scale and enhanced the existing MNO relationships in the region. As a point of reference, prior to the Eaton transaction, we had constructed less than 2,200 sites in the preceding 9 years of operations in Africa combined.\nTurning to Europe. We saw growth of 18.8%, reflecting pronounced contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which was not in our Q1 2021 base. Absent Telxius, our legacy European business grew over 6%, an expansion of 300 basis points as compared to our Q1 2021 growth rate.\nAs we look to the back half of 2022, where we'll have more comparable year-over-year results with Telxius included, we expect to see strong organic tenant billings growth in the mid-7% range, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G.\nIn APAC, we saw growth of 2.1%, a continuation of the improvements we have seen over the past several quarters as churn further moderates in the India market. In fact, churn is now down to the mid-6% range, the lowest we've seen in nearly 5 years, which we project to further improve over the course of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 13% or nearly 14% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61%, down over 5 percentage points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced Sprint churn, along with the higher pass-through revenue resulting from rising fuel costs.\nMoving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by roughly 6% and nearly 4%, respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the timing of cash taxes and maintenance CapEx in 2021, which was heavily back-end weighted. The contributions of these 2 line items provided a negative year-over-year growth headwind of approximately 5% on AFFO in the quarter.\nLet's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, due to higher pass-through revenue associated with rising fuel costs, strong underlying trends in the business and modest FX improvements, we're increasing our property revenue outlook by $75 million at the midpoint.\nIt's important to note that we continue to apply our standard methodology for projecting FX across our regions, taking the more conservative of the trailing 30-day spot rate averages and an aggregation of bank estimates. When applying current spot rates, we would actually see improvement beyond these revised assumptions, although we believe it's prudent to continue with our standard approach.\nSecond, through solid conversion of our top line upside, the carryforward of some cost benefits and strong services performance in Q1, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $55 million. At an attributable AFFO per share level, we are raising our guide at the midpoint to $9.72, an increase of $0.02.\nFinally, as I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our prior guidance assumptions around the equity financing for CoreSite.\nWith that, let's move into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 14% at the midpoint. The increase, as compared to prior guidance, is due to approximately $66 million in additional international pass-through and straight-line revenue, $7 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with another $2 million in FX benefits.\nMoving to Slide 9, you'll see our revised organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2022. With the leasing environment remaining largely consistent across our footprint, we are reiterating our prior growth rates for Latin America, APAC, international, U.S. and Canada and on a total consolidated basis. We are modestly raising our expectations for Africa, driven by stronger new business, and Europe mainly due to higher CPI-driven escalation contributions. As such, we now expect organic growth of greater than 6% and greater than 9% in Africa and Europe, respectively.\nMoving to Slide 10. And as noted earlier, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $55 million and now expect year-over-year growth of roughly 10.5%. These revised expectations include $26 million from cash gross margin outperformance, driven by the increase in our revenue guidance and some services margin expansion, partially offset by higher pass-through expenses. We also now expect an additional $19 million in net straight line and another $10 million associated with revised FX assumptions.\nTurning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $10 million at the midpoint as the benefits from the operational and FX upside I just mentioned are being partially offset by higher interest expenses, the result of an elevated rate curve since our last call. This translates to an increase of $0.02 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.72.\nAs I mentioned earlier, and consistent with our initial outlook, our AFFO guidance includes an assumption for the CoreSite equity financing, which, for modeling purposes, assumes a common equity issuance by midyear. However, we continue to evaluate several potential sources, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferred equity and other convertible instruments and also private capital partnerships, where discussions continue to progress as a result of strong interest from leading private investors for a minority stake in our U.S. data center business. That said, we remain flexible in our approach, with the final mix ultimately depending upon what course offers the most attractive cost of capital, terms and operational flexibility.\nFinally, with respect to the balance sheet management, following our recent senior unsecured note issuance, which I highlighted earlier, and pro forma for executing our equity financing, we will have termed out a significant balance of our floating rate debt and would expect to bring our net leverage to the high 5x range, with a clear path to returning to our target range of 3 to 5x over the next couple of years.\nMoving on to Slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2022, which are consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continued focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. As always, distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top priority, and we continue to expect to allocate, subject to Board approval, approximately $2.8 billion towards our dividend in 2022. On a per share basis, this equates to approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth, consistent with our double-digit target.\nOn the CapEx front, we are reiterating our prior outlook midpoints across all categories. This plan supports our initial expectations to construct approximately 6,500 new sites across our international footprint and includes roughly $300 million towards our data center business, $270 million of which is tied to development projects. We will continue to prioritize our development opportunities across our global footprint given its strong return profile and our ability to largely fund these initiatives through locally generated cash flows. In fact, of the nearly 1,450 sites we constructed in Q1, we saw an average day-1 NOI yield of 14%, at the high end of the double-digit initial return rates we've seen through our build program historically.\nLooking ahead, our development pipeline remains strong, with opportunities afforded by our scale, market positions, customer relationships, operational capabilities and solid underlying secular trends, which continue to drive strong demand across the portfolio.\nFinally, on Slide 13 and in summary, Q1 was a fantastic start to the year, with organic tenant billings growth accelerating sequentially across each of our reported segments as 5G deployments, 4G densification initiatives and the benefits of our comprehensive MLA agreements drive strong organic new leasing and increasing demand for newly constructed sites.\nWe see the same secular trends driving solid performance on the data center front, and we could not be happier with the assets and team we've added through the CoreSite and DataSite acquisitions. We continue to be encouraged by the demand trends across our global portfolio of distributed communications real estate and look forward to executing on a number of strategic initiatives, including finalizing our CoreSite financing through the rest of the year, as we aim to deliver compelling total returns to our stockholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.",

Welcome to the American Tower Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam Smith\n\nVP of IR, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\nOn this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our Stand and Deliver strategy. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2021 results and 2022 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas A. Bartlett\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we generated strong results in 2021, while strategically deploying capital to assets that we believe will further enhance our future growth trajectory and augment our ability to continue to deliver compelling total shareholder returns for many years to come. The strength of our operational and financial results reflects the high-quality nature of our tower business model, the dedication of our talented global teams and our commitment to provide best-in-class service to our customers. It also reflects our commitment to sustainability and being a good corporate citizen, which provides additional purpose and continues to be a focus at every level of the organization.\nLast year at this time, we presented multiyear targets for U.S. organic tenant billings growth and AFFO per share growth. And I'm pleased to be able to say that we're exactly where we thought we would be today as it relates to those targets. We continue to expect to average at least 4% in U.S. organic tenant billings growth from 2021 through 2027 on a reported basis, implying an average of at least 5%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. And as part of these projections, we anticipate an acceleration in U.S. organic tenant billings growth between 2023 and 2027, when we are targeting growth rates of at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6%, excluding the Sprint churn.\nSimilarly, on the AFFO side of the equation, we believe we are on track to average at least 10% growth in AFFO per share, on average through 2027. This includes a year of more subdued growth in 2022, as expected, but also a recovery in growth rates in 2023 and beyond as the Sprint churn impacts fade and global secular growth tailwinds continue.\n5G is probably the most significant of these growth drivers. And in 2021, we saw the early stages of transformational 5G network upgrades in multiple markets, including nearly $105 billion spent by U.S. carriers for critical mid-band spectrum and over $65 billion in CapEx deployed by carriers into network investments across our global footprint. With mobile data consumption expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 25% over the next 5 years in the United States and at even higher rates in some of our international markets, we anticipate prolonged network investment cycles to drive compelling, sustained growth rates across our regions. And while we believe our macro tower assets will continue to drive the vast majority of growth and returns for the company as 5G advances, we're also excited about additional opportunities that we expect to arise from the accelerating cloud-based interconnected and globally distributed digital transformation that is in its early stages today.\nWe expect our recently closed CoreSite acquisition to augment our ability to capture potential upside from this transformation while enhancing the value of our existing portfolio of distributed communications real estate over time. We anticipate these expectations to be underpinned by the continued execution of the 4 strategic pillars in our Stand and Deliver strategy, growing our assets and capabilities, driving industry leadership, operational efficiency and extending our platform.\nAs part of our commitment to growing our assets and capabilities to meet our customers' needs, we deployed more than $10 billion for tower M&A in 2021 focused on Europe, where we have meaningfully improved our long-term strategic positioning. We saw accelerated organic growth trends in the region throughout the last year, and we expect those trends to continue, supported by data growth projected at a CAGR of 26% over the next 5 years across our major European markets.\nSeparately, we added strategic financial partners, CDPQ and Alliant, who joined our existing partner, PGGM, creating a solid platform for future growth and investment ahead of what we anticipate being an exciting decade in the European marketplace.\nIn addition to expanding through M&A, we further grew our asset base through our internal CapEx program by investing $1.4 billion, primarily to construct a record of nearly 6,400 new communication sites, along with deploying nearly $120 million towards our energy efficiency investments, primarily in Africa. These investments continue to generate returns that are among the highest in our portfolio. Through our talented teams and operational expertise, we expect to remain a preferred partner to support customers as they execute on their network build-outs, which we expect to drive continued acceleration in our new site construction for the next several years, while advancing our sustainability efforts and commitment to a greener mobile future.\nThrough our commitment to enhance our industry leadership, we've continued our focus on sustainability by accelerating our efforts to combat climate change, as evidenced by our recent adoption of science-based targets for carbon emission reductions. These targets represent direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 40% by 2035 against the 2019 baseline, as well as targets to reduce indirect supply chain emissions by at least 40%. To date, we've invested over $275 million in CapEx towards energy efficiency and reduction solutions, which directly support our committed targets and initiatives.\nConcurrent with our emissions reduction targets and renewable energy investments, we are actively working on various land stewardship and social impact initiatives. We're a member of the World Economic Forum's Edison Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge, which aims to spur development of affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance and education to the underserved. Through our involvement, we engaged with an array of high-level country and regional platforms and committed our time, expertise and ideas to make digital access a top priority for all.\nAlso this past year, American Tower was awarded a 2021 World Summit on the Information Society prize for our digital communities program, which spans across India, Africa and Latin America and seeks to improve the quality of life and increase economic opportunity through connectivity. At the end of 2021, we reached a significant milestone of launching our 200th digital community in India and have set a goal to grow to 2,000 digital communities globally over the next 5 years, focusing on education, health care access, financial inclusion and career development.\nFinally, we advanced our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by implementing customized plans focused on talent development, recruitment and education to enhance our inclusive culture across our global footprint. We also continued our partnership with HBCU supporting critical infrastructure enhancement projects and engaging in academic and professional development opportunities for their talented students.\nFurther, we extended our leadership position and NAREIT's dividends through diversity, equity and inclusion CEO Counsel, which addresses opportunities related to DE&I in the REIT and publicly traded real estate industry. Also, we stay on top of the best ESG practices, policies and actions within the REIT sector through active participation on NAREIT councils and initiatives. These accomplishments and areas of focus are reflections of our unwavering commitment to operating our global business in a sustainable way while guided by our core principles.\nWe are also steadfast in driving operational efficiency throughout the business. Over the past several years, we've implemented shared service center model, executed on various cost control and process improvement initiatives and implemented site level enhancements that not only drive value to American Tower but also for our customers. An example of these initiatives is our use of drone technology to help us ensure the structural integrity of our sites. In 2021, our U.S. team demonstrated its capabilities to scale up driving service revenue to its highest level in over a decade in supporting major carrier activity in preparation for 5G deployments.\nLooking ahead, we believe the investments we have made in the operating structures and processes that have been put in place are competitive advantages that will facilitate scalable expansion while converting meaningful top line growth to AFFO. At the same time, through our platform expansion initiatives, we've evaluated a range of new communications' real estate models to identify long-term growth opportunities that could complement and leverage our global tower presence, further advance our position as a market leader ahead of emerging technological trends and create attractive returns for our stakeholders. Through this process, we believe advanced wireless network technologies, in conjunction with the shift of computing power from the core to the edge, will accelerate digital transformation across many industries. We've only begun to understand the true capabilities and performance of widespread 5G coverage. And with new applications on the horizon, we think mobile edge computing will become a critical component of converged neutral host infrastructure.\nWe believe today's 5G Edge, deployed in public or private networks with regional site hosting, will evolve to distributed tower-centric locations. We think future AI and machine learning, edge-optimized solutions supporting massive IoT devices and immersive experiences enabled with AR and VR, such as gaming, health care and education, will drive latency-sensitive edge deployments across our strategically positioned set of assets. We expect this evolution and these deployments to drive a meaningful TAM with our distributed macro tower assets ideally located to host such computing infrastructure and an integrated grid that enhances our competitive position and service offerings.\nTogether with the CoreSite and our other data center assets, we have the scale to enable a richly interconnected hub-and-spoke edge-computing model that extends today's data center multi-cloud ecosystem out to our distributed neutral host sites, greatly enhancing our probability of success at the edge.\nOn that note, I'd like to welcome the CoreSite team to the American Tower family. And together, I look forward to executing on our long-term development plan, while driving meaningful incremental value to our macro tower sites over time.\nAs we move forward, we remain focused on further enhancing our investment-grade balance sheet, which has been a critical element that has enabled us to grow, and we expect it to remain an important component of our future success as well. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. And with the strength of our balance sheet as our foundation, we will continue to apply our Stand and Deliver strategic framework to capture value as 5G and growing mobile demand present compelling growth opportunities for American Tower.\nIn closing, we believe that our comprehensive global portfolio, strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation strategy and continued focus on sustainability position us to extend our track record of driving solid growth and returns as we embark upon an exciting new era of digital transformation enabled by 5G. We will continue to execute on our Stand and Deliver strategy and follow the same values and discipline that have fueled our track record over the last 2 decades. As we continue to build and strengthen our diverse comprehensive portfolio, while enhancing our operational capabilities, we believe American Tower is well positioned to support our global customer base as we enter a hyper-connected, digitally driven world.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our 2021 results and the details of our 2022 outlook. Rod?\n\nRodney M. Smith\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, American Tower Corporation (REIT)\n\nThanks, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are well. As you just heard from Tom, American Tower had another year of solid performance, which included strong Q4 results throughout our global business. Before we dive into the details of our expectations for 2022, I'll briefly review our Q4 and full year 2021 results. To start, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year.\nFirst, 2021 marked another year of strong overachievement against our initial AFFO per share targets. For the full year, we posted consolidated and attributable AFFO per share growth of 13.7% and 11.7%, respectively. This is a demonstration of our ability to deliver solid total revenue growth, tightly manage operating costs and execute on strategically important M&A transactions, all while maintaining a thoughtful and disciplined approach to our capital structure. I'll also note, this is a great start towards achieving our previously stated objective of delivering, on average, double-digit AFFO per share growth between 2021 and 2027.\nSecond, we delivered our third consecutive year of record new builds. As we've discussed previously, these newly constructed sites continue to be amongst our best uses of capital. And in 2021, we saw average day 1 NOI yield of nearly 12% over the nearly 6,400 sites we constructed.\nFinally, during 2021, we completed 2 strategic M&A transactions and, as a result, strengthened our position in the United States and Europe, 2 critically important markets for us. With that, let's dive into the details of our Q4 and full year 2021 results.\nTurning to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated property revenues grew by more than 13% year-over-year or over 14% on an FX-neutral basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, property revenue grew 1.2%. This included an organic tenant billings growth decline of 0.5% or an increase of over 4% when excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. As a reminder, over half of the total Sprint churn commenced in 2021, primarily on October 1, as expected.\nInternational property revenues grew over 28%, with nearly 20% driven by contributions from our Telxius assets. International organic tenant billings growth was 5.7%, led by Latin America at 7.4%, followed by Africa at 7.3% and Europe at 6.6%. APAC grew for the second consecutive quarter, coming in at 1.3%. This was complemented by the addition of nearly 1,900 high-yielding, newly constructed sites across our international markets.\nMoving to adjusted EBITDA. Growth was over 10% in the quarter, while the impacts of Sprint churn, combined with the addition of newer, lower-tenancy assets, drove a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 62%. Finally, consolidated AFFO per share grew 3.8% in the quarter or 4.3%, excluding the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. This included nearly $140 million of year-on-year cash-adjusted EBITDA growth, which was partially offset by the higher net cash interest expense, along with higher cash taxes and maintenance costs. As anticipated, the timing of these expenses was heavily back-end weighted in 2021, resulting in a material impact to the year-over-year growth rates in Q4. Meanwhile, AFFO per share attributable to American Tower common stockholders grew by 1.4% in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was 14.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 3.8% and total tenant billings growth of 11.3%. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was nearly 9%, with organic tenant billings growth of 2.9%. This included contributions from co-locations and amendments of 3.2%; another 3% in growth from escalators; around 0.2% in negative impacts from other run rate items; and churn of 3%, which consisted of around 1.8% in normal cost churn and the balance driven by Sprint. This was complemented by new asset contributions to tenant billings of 4.1% and approximately $144 million in higher straight-line revenues as compared to 2020.\nOur international property revenue grew by over 21% with organic tenant billings growth of 5.5% for the year. Overall colocation and amendment growth was 5.9%, while 3.8% came from escalators and 0.3% from other run rate items, all of which was partially offset by 4.5% of churn. This elevated churn was primarily concentrated in India, where more recently, we have started to see the churn rate moderate.\nFinally, with our recent expanded data center portfolio, we have introduced a new data center segment within total property, consisting of the newly acquired CoreSite and DataSite assets along with our existing Colo ATL facility. This segment contributed approximately $23 million to our total property revenue in 2021.\nTurning to Slide 10. Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the year to nearly $6 billion. This included strong flow-through of organic tenant billings growth; $100 million in incremental services gross margin versus 2020; over $140 million in net straight-line growth, as well as around $300 million in contributions to growth from newly acquired assets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.\nOn a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 20 basis points as compared to 2020, primarily due to the impacts of Sprint churn in the U.S. and the addition of newer lower tenancy international assets, which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time.\nWe also grew consolidated AFFO by 15.4% and consolidated AFFO per share by 13.7% in 2021, with over $680 million in cash adjusted EBITDA growth from the drivers I just mentioned. This growth was partially offset by higher financing costs associated with our recent strategic M&A as well as a modest increase in maintenance CapEx and higher cash tax expense as compared to 2020. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share grew 11.7% year-over-year.\nWith that, let's turn to our outlook for 2022. I'll start by highlighting a few key assumptions underlying our projections. First, we expect a strong year of new leasing activity across our operations, with anticipated gross new business contributions to total tenant billings growth nearly 7% higher than what we saw in 2021. This expectation is being driven by a few key items.\nIn the U.S., the comprehensive MLAs we've signed over the last few years are continuing to result in solid levels of new business activity. In Europe, we expect an exceptionally strong year, boosted by our larger presence following the Telxius transaction. And across our developing market footprint, the demand for site continues to rise as next-generation network deployments advance.\nSecond, we expect churn to be higher than historical levels in 2022. In the United States, this will be driven by Sprint churn we've discussed previously, with about $160 million in year-over-year impacts in 2022 versus 2021. Additionally, in select international markets, a handful of carrier consolidation events are temporarily driving churn higher.\nThird, we've layered in some preliminary assumptions related to our CoreSite financing.\nAnd finally, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $125 million for property revenue, $70 million for adjusted EBITDA and $55 million for consolidated AFFO versus 2021.\nMoving into the details on Slide 11, you can see we expect total property revenues of over $10.3 billion at the midpoint, representing growth of 13% or nearly 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes expected property revenue growth of less than 1% in the U.S. and Canada and over 14% of FX-neutral growth in our international regions. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $705 million of growth in cash revenue to the Property segment in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 12, and unpacking the property revenue growth assumptions a bit, you'll see our expected organic tenant billings growth rates for 2022. I'd like to note here that our tenant billings metrics do not include contributions from the data center segment.\nLooking at the United States and Canada, we anticipate growth of approximately 1%, in line with the 2022 expectations implied in the long-term projections we presented last year. This includes contributions to growth from colocations and amendments of roughly $150 million, representing solid double-digit growth versus 2021. We expect this to be partially offset by churn of over 5%, which includes a 3.7% impact associated with Sprint.\nTurning to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 6% for the year, supported by solid gross colocation and amendment activity as well as additional growth from our CPI-based escalators, which we anticipate to be around 300 basis points higher than in 2021. These items are being partially offset by higher churn in 2022, primarily related to Telefonica in Mexico as well as the continuation of Nextel churn in Brazil. With both events, we expect to receive settlement payments over the course of 2022, compensating us for the early termination of leases ahead of their expiration, where applicable. As is typical, these payments will fall outside of the organic tenant billings growth metrics.\nMoving to Africa. Organic tenant billings growth is expected to be in the 6% range. We continue to see strong demand for our macro tower assets driving colocation and amendment growth of around 6.5% for the year. In addition, we expect escalators to be up as compared to 2021 by roughly 90 basis points. This will be partially offset by an expectation for elevated churn as carrier consolidation and some smaller market exit events from Q4 of 2021 work their way through our 2022 financial metrics.\nMeanwhile, in Europe, we're seeing the benefits of added scale from the Telxius acquisition, the early stages of 5G rollouts and low churn, all driving expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9% in 2022. This includes roughly 6% in contributions from colocations and amendments and escalators of around 4.5%. These higher escalators are being driven by the combination of higher CPI and the mechanics of having the Telxius assets in our numbers for the full year of 2022. Churn is expected to decline to around 1.5% as we benefit from the lower-churn Telxius assets and reduced cancellations across our legacy business as carrier consolidation events wind down.\nFinally, in Asia Pacific, we're guiding to 2% to 3% organic tenant billings growth in 2022, including churn of around 5%, representing less than half of the 2021 churn rate. At the same time, our outlook does imply a reduction to gross colocation and amendment growth contributions relative to 2021 levels as carriers in the marketplace continue to digest recent developments. With that said, we are encouraged by the market reforms aimed at improving the overall health of the telecom sector as well as more recent steps taken by the carriers to rationalize pricing and improve overall profitability in the marketplace. We think these steps could bode well for the long-term growth picture in India.\nTurning to Slide 13. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're projecting adjusted EBITDA of over $6.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10% or nearly 11% on a constant currency basis. We continue to drive solid organic growth conversion rates and are complementing this through growth on assets acquired in 2021, including approximately $360 million in expected adjusted EBITDA from CoreSite in 2022.\nWe are seeing some margin compression in 2022. This is primarily the result of Sprint churn in the U.S., along with the full year impact of the slightly lower-margin CoreSite and Telxius assets. That said, the benefits of our continued focus on operational efficiency are taking hold in our regional legacy businesses, particularly in Africa, where our commitment to sustainable energy solutions and strong cost controls are driving meaningful expansions in margins.\nTurning to Slide 14, we expect consolidated AFFO to grow by more than $380 million to over $4.7 billion, despite absorbing approximately $160 million in negative impacts to AFFO from Sprint churn. This includes $675 million in FX-neutral cash-adjusted EBITDA growth and the expectation for maintenance CapEx to be more or less flat as compared to 2021 as capital intensity remains in the 2% range. We expect this to be partially offset by approximately $55 million in higher cash taxes and $185 million in incremental cash interest expense, primarily associated with our preliminary CoreSite financing assumption as well as roughly $55 million in expected negative translational FX impacts. Additionally, we've layered in a common stock issuance assumption for the purposes of outlook in the first half of 2022, again, tied to the CoreSite transaction. Taking these assumptions into account, we expect our consolidated AFFO per share for the year to be $10.05, reflecting growth of 4%, or roughly 8%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn.\nFinally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders is expected to grow approximately 3% year-over-year to $9.70 per share in 2022. This includes an assumption of approximately $165 million in minority interest impacts related to our partnerships in Europe.\nMoving on to Slide 15, let's review our capital deployment in 2021 and expectations for 2022. In 2021, we declared nearly $2.4 billion of common dividend distributions, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. We spent another $1.4 billion through our CapEx programs, over $500 million of which was dedicated to our development projects, including the construction of nearly 6,400 new sites across the globe.\nFinally, we deployed over $20 billion, including the assumption of debt to acquire the Telxius and CoreSite assets as well as a handful of smaller transactions around the world. We expect these new assets to drive meaningful accretion and shareholder value over time.\nLooking to 2022, our dividend remains a top priority. And subject to board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $2.8 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to increase the dividend in line with our stated long-term, double-digit growth targets. We also expect to deploy roughly $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, over 90% of which will be discretionary. Of our total discretionary capital spending, we expect approximately $270 million to be directed towards attractive organic development opportunities in our data center segment.\nOn the tower side, we expect to deploy roughly $565 million in development CapEx, primarily for the construction of 6,500 sites in our International segment. Similar to 2021, we anticipate driving average day 1 NOI yields on these new builds of nearly 12%. As you can see on the chart to the right, these international new site investments have driven exceptional returns over time. In our earliest vintage, we're seeing average NOI yields of 46%. Sites built between 2010 and 2014 are yielding around 26%. And on the more than 26,000 sites we've constructed since the start of 2015, we're seeing yields in the 20% range, with room to expand as we continue to drive lease-up on these lower-tenured sites. Looking forward, we believe our international new-build program presents a significant opportunity to continue adding meaningful portfolio scale while achieving highly attractive returns. And we'll continue to prioritize site development opportunities as a key part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term.\nTurning now to Slide 16, we've laid out our current thoughts around the permanent financing strategy for our CoreSite acquisition. As always, the primary objective is for us to finance this transaction in a way that optimizes our capital structure within our investment-grade framework, minimizes dilution to our common stockholders and positions us to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in ways that maximize value creation for our shareholders over the long term.\nAt a high level, we expect to get there through a combination of debt and equity issuances. The debt markets remain attractive. And as we have done in the past, we expect to be opportunistic as we seek to term out revolver and term loan borrowings into longer-term fixed rate instruments. On the equity side, we anticipate evaluating a number of alternatives, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferreds and private capital partnerships, much like we did for the Telxius acquisition in 2021.\nWith that said, for the purposes of our initial 2022 outlook, we have assumed that roughly half of the $10 billion purchase price will be financed through a common equity issuance assumed to occur in the first half of 2022. As you can see on the slide, we anticipate that this will bring our leverage back down to the high 5x range while putting us on track to get back to 5x or below over the slightly longer term.\nImportantly, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and have been working closely with the rating agencies throughout this process. As we continue to evaluate a number of potential options, particularly on the equity side, we will plan to keep you all updated as to our progress. In the meantime, we believe that the baseline case we have incorporated in our current outlook positions us well as we create long-term shareholder value with the CoreSite assets.\nTurning now to Slide 17, and in summary, we drove strong results in 2021, including compelling double-digit AFFO per share growth, record new build activity prudent, balance sheet management and the completion of several transactions that we believe will enhance American Tower's leading global position. As we look across our global footprint, we're encouraged by what we see as a long tailwind of secular technology trends that are expected to drive continued strong recurring demand for our critical communication infrastructure assets.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, we're well positioned to support a continued acceleration in 5G activity as carriers deploy new spectrum assets and build out greenfield networks. Meanwhile, in our early-stage markets, we expect to benefit as operators look to upgrade and densify their mobile networks to meet ever-increasing mobile data demand, all of which we believe will translate into meaningful growth and attractive total shareholder returns at American Tower for many years to come.\nAnd with that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions.",

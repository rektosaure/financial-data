It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alexis Smith, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Alexis.\n\nAlexis Smith\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Incyte's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides that follow today's discussion. On today's call, I'm joined by Bill Pablo and Tom, who will deliver our prepared remarks, Stephen, Dave, Matteo and Mohammed will also be available for Q&A. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nI'll now hand the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Meury\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Alexis, and good morning, everyone. On our last call, I told you I'd be taking a fresh look at the company with a focus on getting the core business right, our R&D priorities right and our cost base, right? This, of course, is a continuous process and one that is well underway and on track. In terms of the core business, my assessment has reinforced my confidence in the growth potential of our key products.\nAs we announced today, we had a strong quarter with total revenues of $1.37 billion and product sales of $1.15 billion. This represents a 20% and 19% increase, respectively, versus prior year. The fundamentals around Jakafi, Opzelura and our Hem-Onc business, Niktimvo and Monjuvi, namely remains strong. Our job right now is to keep it that way and to identify effective ways to optimize the promotional strategies and investment for these products to drive future growth.\nJakafi Q3 sales reached $791 million, a 7% increase with strong demand growth of 10% year-over-year. Growth was broad-based across all 3 indications. In MF Jakafi utilization continues to increase, and we are maintaining market share leadership despite competition. Growth in GBAD remains strong, supported by our portfolio strategy with Niktimvo, which is helping identify patients across multiple lines of therapy. MPV is our largest growth driver, fueled by compelling MAGIC PV data showing impressive thrombosis free survival. Based on this momentum, we're raising our full year guidance for Jakafi to a new range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion.\nOpzelura growth was exceptional in the third quarter and continues to be a significant contributor to revenue. With $188 million in sales, a 35% increase versus prior year. Of this, $144 million in net sales came from the U.S., which represented a 21% increase versus prior year. The increase was based on strong prescription demand across both indications and more favorable formulary placement at the 3 top PBMs. In July, we reorganized the Opzelura sales force into 2 dedicated sales teams, 1 for AD and 1 for vitiligo, to ensure execution and sustained growth. The market for branded non-sterile topicals continues to expand at a 20% rate as more patients migrate off and away from topical corticosteroids. Given the efficacy of Opzelura in terms of rapid itch relief and skin clearance, our broad prescriber base and formulary coverage, we're well positioned to take advantage of this market dynamic.\nInternationally, sales for Opzelura and Vitiligo totaled $44 million, representing a 117% increase from last year. France, Spain, Italy and Canada account for over 80% of our sales and growth and we plan to file an application for ruxolitinib cream in moderate AD in the EU by year-end with a potential approval in the second half of 2026.\nNow in its third quarter post long Niktimvo continues to outperform expectations across all launch metrics. Sales in the third quarter totaled $46 million, an increase of 27% versus the second quarter. 90% BMT centers have adopted Niktimvo with all centers placing repeat orders year-to-date. Importantly, 80% of patients who started treatment in the first quarter of launch are still on therapy today. And we've captured 13% of the third line plus GVHD opportunity in just the first 9 months on the market. .\nIn line with expectations, Niktimvo was primarily being used in the fourth line with increasing preference and utilization in the third line. Feedback from BMT centers has been positive with real-world efficacy and safety being equally as impressive as the clinical data. Finally, we're actively studying Niktimvo in combination with ruxolitinib and steroids in earlier line settings. Our combination study with Jakafi is designed to enable a steroid-free regimen in GVHD, which could shift the standard of care. And our combination study with steroids in the frontline setting has the potential to deliver benchmark efficacy and steroid tapering. This franchise strategy has the potential to significantly increase our addressable market and strengthen our leadership position in GVHD.\nOur broader hematology and oncology portfolio also performed well this quarter. Sales from Monjuvi and follicular lymphoma and [indiscernible] both launched this year saw strong growth and contributed to our raised guidance. These products will be incremental contributors to our portfolio and collectively can deliver meaningful sales growth over the next several years.\nWe have 3 important new product launches next year, ruxolitinib XR, Opzelura-AD in Europe and povorcitinib and HS. I've completed a thorough review of the launch plans and believe these products have the potential to contribute significantly to Insight's future growth. Strategically, ruxolitinib XR upon approval offers the same therapeutic benefits of Jakafi and a more convenient once-daily dosing regimen. The stability data are on track to be submitted to the FDA before end of the year with an anticipated launch in mid 2026.\nAs it relates to Opzelura-AD, as mentioned, we plan to submit our application in the EU with an anticipated launch next year, assuming approval, Opzelura has the potential to contribute meaningfully to future sales in the EU 4 and Canada and to overall growth given its clinical and economic value proposition. With the moderate ADD indication in Europe, we could potentially increase our international topical business by 2x to 3x over the next several years. And finally, povorcitinib could be the first oral option for patients with HS which is perhaps the most challenging disease in dermatology. It's a multi-cytokine disease, involving many pathways, making treatment more complex and results more variable, a treat option like povarcitinib, which has shown rapid pain relief and skin clearance scores of over 50% will be very marketable.\nWe believe there's a substantial opportunity in HS, which is the first step for Pova -- our ongoing developments in PN and Vitiligo will come into focus next year, and if positive, further strengthened the position of Povo in our derm portfolio. Together with Opzelura, we could provide a topical to oral offering for patients across HS, Vitiligo and PN. Launch activities for each product remain on schedule, including preparations for the sales force, payer engagement and medical education initiatives, will share more details in early 2026.\nTurning to R&D. Our ongoing pipeline review is providing us with absolute clarity about which high-value programs are core to future growth and have the greatest potential to create value and outsized returns. We want to configure a balanced pipeline that is not consumed by either safe, low-value projects or moonshots. We've set clear go/no go criteria for moving key projects forward. We will invest and take calculated risks in key programs rather than thinly spreading investments across many programs. In other words, fewer smarter investments versus diffused spending will fund what matters and importantly, watch out for false positives and negatives.\nAs it relates to our developing pipeline, the first call on capital is HemOnc, this is central identity of the company and an area where we have differentiated knowledge and capabilities and an asymmetrical advantage. This includes targeted therapies for MPNs, including MCLR617and our MCLR bispecific and discovery programs. We have a window of opportunity here to trigger an innovation-based shift in MPNs from nonspecific symptomatic therapies like Jakafi and HU to targeted mutation-specific therapies, like 989.\nNext steps for 989 and 617 will be shared later this year and next year. In terms of our solid tumor program, the cornerstone of our cancer strategy is novel biological pathways, high-incidence cancers with substantial medical need that missed the IO revolution, and immunotherapies and targeted therapies that can be used frontline in combination with standard of care regimens. As you know, we have 3 program early development, KRASG12D for pancreatic cancer TGF-beta by PD-1 bispecific for MSS CRC and CDK2 for ovarian cancer. Over the next several months, we will collect more data on these programs in terms of response rates, duration of response and safety, particularly in combination with standard of care. We'll move forward without delay providing our data continue to be objectively competitive, and we can be early to market and defend our position long term. Now in terms of our operating expenses and overall cost structure, we're conducting a review of the entire business, which focuses on prioritization and data-driven trade-off decisions.\nOur objective is to manage costs but not underfund critical initiatives and compromise growth prospects. We'll strike the right balance between financial discipline and long-term strategic investments. which can be achieved by controlling costs in low-value areas to free up capital either for reinvestment in high-value opportunities or to improve margins. Our framework for the 2026 budget and beyond will be based on the following: First, define and ring fence our strategic growth drivers. This means the new product launches that I touched on as well as key R&D projects, which we have earmarked as nonnegotiable fully funded programs. Once we protect the growth drivers, we're looking to control costs in areas that add less or minimal strategic value. From there, the savings we've identified and achieved will either be reallocated or banked. This will be a continuous process not a one-and-done exercise, it's a mindset as our business evolves, so will our resource allocation.\nFinally, business development. BD works when you have strong strategic leadership, high throughput and a framework for rapidly triaging opportunities and making decisions, which requires a skilled search and evaluation team and a deep network. To be successful, we need to operate inside the loop in our focus areas. Accordingly, Dave Gardner joined Incyte as Chief Strategy Officer in September, and one of his priorities is to build out this capability. He will play a central role in developing our long-term growth strategy and ensuring external business development opportunities and internal portfolio decisions are strategically sound and financially compelling. We will share more details about our strategic review early next year.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As shown on Slide 14, our pipeline is strategically focused with numerous high-impact programs currently in development. Over the past few months, we have conducted a thorough pipeline review to ensure we're concentrating our efforts and resources on the projects that are essential to the future growth of the company. As Bill mentioned, this process was guided by a clear set of go no-go criteria, enabling us to make strategic decisions about which programs to advance.\nAs a result, we have decided to pause or stop several preclinical and early clinical stage programs, including INCA-34460, our anti-CD122 program, INCB57643, our BET inhibitor program and the development of Povorcitinib in chronic spontaneous urticaria. By continuing to streamline our pipeline, we will be able to accelerate and prioritize the programs with the greatest potential impact to patients and to drive future growth.\nNow I'd like to focus on key updates from the quarter, highlighting recent advancements with Povorcitinib and our solid tumor franchise. I will also discuss expected for the remainder of 2025 from our mutant color antibody program. For Povorcitinib, last month, we presented longer-term data in Hidradenitis Suppurativa at the European Academy of Dermatology and Vinerology Congress, which further reinforced the differentiated profile of Povorcitinib. The 24-week data demonstrated deep and sustained improvements across key clinical endpoints, including HiSCR50, 75, 90 and 100, resolution of draining tunnels and effective reduction in flares.\nPovorcitinib also showed a rapid and robust reduction in skin pain, with 62% to 70% of patients reporting mild or no pain by week 24. [indiscernible] experience in the management of HS emphasize that their primary focus when they treat patients with HS is on 2 elements, help patients feel better by addressing the pain related to HS and to effectively control flares. The data percentage show that Povorcitinib provides rapid and sustained pain relief and reduces the frequency of flares. This positive Phase III results demonstrate the potential of Povorcitinib to address the significant medical needs of the more than 300,000 people living with moderate to severe HS, offering a novel, effective and convenient oral treatment option for this underserved patient population.\nMoving to Slide 16 and the near-term opportunities for Povorcitinib. As you know, HS is the most advanced programs, and we're on track with our regulatory submission at the end of the year in the EU and early 2026 in the U.S. with potential approvals and launches in late 2026 early 2027. In addition to HS, we're starting Povorcitinib in 3 other indications, underscoring its potential to become a major growth driver for the company. Povorcitinib is being evaluated in Phase III programs in vitiligo and prurigo nodularis as well as a Phase II proof-of-concept study in asthma. We anticipate pivotal data readouts for vitiligo and PN in 2026 with a goal of potential initial regulatory approvals in 2027, 2028.\nNext, I would like to highlight 2 recent updates from our solid tumor portfolio, beginning with our TGF-beta by PD-1 bispecific antibody program. This month, at the European Society of Medical Oncology Annual Meeting we presented initial Phase I data for INCA-33890, as I'll refer to moving forward, 890, our first-in-class TGFßR2xPD-1 bispecific antibody in patients with solid tumors. This is an inside discover compound and one that is truly differentiated from other TGF-beta and PD-1 approaches. The Phase I trial evaluated 89 [indiscernible] solid tumors with a focus on microsatellite stable or MSS colorectal cancer patients. 890 demonstrated durable single-agent anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile in fully pretreated MSS colorectal cancer patients, a population with limited treatment options and where anti-PD-1 PD-L1 antibodies have historically produced response rates from 0% to 2%.\nIn patients with MSS colorectal, 890 achieved an overall response rate of 15% and most notably, responses were observed in patients with and without liver metastases. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were low grade with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. We also completed dose escalation of 890 in combinations of 4 cohorts. FOLFOX for bevacizumab, FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, bevacizumab and cetuximab. No evidence of additive toxicity has been observed in any of the combination cohorts and dose expansion is ongoing. This initial results provide a strong rationale for advancing 890 into a registrational program.\nWe're planning to start a pivotal Phase III trial evaluating 890 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy in bevacizumab in first-line MSS colorectal cancer patients in 2026.\nTurning to our KRASG12D program on Slide 18. We recently presented encouraging clinical data from the Phase I trial of INCB-161734 or [indiscernible] to moving forward 734 and in heavily pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring the KRASG12D mutation, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, among others. Results demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no dose-limited toxicities observed and predominantly Grade 1 treatment-related adverse events.\nImportantly, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients 734 showed promising antitumor activity with an objective response rate of 34% disease control rate of 86% of the dose of 1,200 milligrams. These results are particularly notable given that only 8 of the patients were treated in the second-line setting.\nTo summarize, both our [indiscernible] by PD-1 and our KRASG12D program represents significant opportunities to address large patient populations with high medical need, specifically MSS colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. As Bill noted, our strategy in both cancers will be to win and frontline in combination with standard of care. 890, we have demonstrated durable single-agent activity in heavily pretreated MSS colorectal cancer patients, including those with liver metastases and a favorable safety profile and combinability for first-line standard of care regimens. As previously mentioned, we're planning to initiate a Phase III study in first-line MSS colorectal in 2026.\nSimilarly, 734 has shown promising anti-tumor activity and manageable safety profile in advanced solid tumors with particularly encouraging results in PDAC. We'll share more updates on this program next year.\nNow to Slide 20. 2025 has been a pivotal year for Incyte, highlighted by multiple new product launches, pivotal trial readouts, Phase III study initiations and proof-of-concept results. These accomplishments reflect the solid progress we've made so far towards the milestones we established at the beginning of the year. As we look at the remainder of the year, we plan to share data for the first time on 989, our mutant color antibody in patients with myelofibrosis. We are evaluating 989 in a broad population of patients with MF. There are 3 actively enrolling cohorts. First, intermediate to high-risk patients who are intolerant, ineligible or resistant to a JAK inhibitor. This cohort is evaluating 989 as a monotherapy. Second, intermediate to high-risk patients who are on ruxolitinib, but experienced a suboptimal spleen response after these 12 weeks of treatment. In this cohort, we are evaluating adding 989 to ruxolitinib.\nAnd finally, we're enrolling patients with intermediate to high-risk treatment-naive MF in a cohort evaluating 989 compared to a combination of 989 and ruxolitinib. This will allow us to see how 989 performs as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in treatment-naive patients. Our update later this year will include early data from the first 2 cohorts. For the monotherapy cohort, we plan to share data from roughly 50 patients, approximately two-thirds of them will have more than 24 weeks of follow-up. Additionally, data will be presented for the combination cohort on at least 15 suboptimal responders to ruxolitinib. More than half of these patients will have a minimum of 24 weeks of follow-up.\nImportantly, the update will include response data used in traditional endpoints as VR25, SBR35, TSS50 and anemia and molecular endpoints like effects on [indiscernible] blood, CD34 mutant-CALR cells in peripheral blood [indiscernible] and mutant color positive megacarocytes in the bone marrow. Additionally, we'll provide an [indiscernible] treated patients with essential thrombocytemia as a follow-up to the encouraging results presented earlier this year.\nAs you'll recall from EHA presentation, 989 demonstrated the rapid and sustained normalization of platelet counts and was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing due to an adverse event. We look forward to sharing updates on the remaining 2025 milestones and to provide further visibility into our 2026 catalyst as we continue to advance our pipeline.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a financial update on the quarter.\n\nThomas Tray\n\nPrincipal Financial Officer, VP of Finance & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Pablo. As Bill mentioned earlier, our total revenues and product revenues were $1.37 billion and $1.15 billion, respectively, increasing 20% and 19% from the prior year. Our total GAAP R&D expenses were $507 million in the third quarter. Excluding onetime expenses in the prior year, R&D expenses increased 7% year-over-year, driven by continued investment in our late-stage development assets.\nMoving to SG&A. Total GAAP SG&A expenses were $329 million in the third quarter, increasing 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by international marketing activities to support product launches. Ongoing operating expenses in the third quarter increased 8% year-over-year compared to an 18% increase in ongoing revenues during the same period, leading to a continued increase in operating leverage and margins. Based on the growth of our product portfolio, we raised 2025 full year net product revenue guidance to $4.23 billion to $4.32 billion. We maintained our prior OpEx guidance of $3.25 billion to $3.31 billion, which reflects combined R&D and SG&A GAAP expenses.\nI'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Meury\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Tom. That concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for Q&A. .",

Before I get started and on behalf of the Incyte management team and the employees, I'd like to thank and recognize Herve for his leadership and commitment to Incyte over 10 years. His contributions to this company were invaluable and greatly appreciated, and we wish him the best in his retirement.\nAs you know, I started at Incyte very recently, roughly 30 days ago. And so before jumping into the quarterly results, I'd like to touch on 2 fundamental questions I've been asked since joining Incyte. The first one is, what specifically attracted me to the company. And second, what are my initial thoughts on strategic priorities. In response to the first question, I naturally studied the company and the business in great detail and spoke to many different stakeholders, including physicians, patients and investors before joining. And my initial impression is that Incyte has all the intrinsic characteristics of a high-quality growth business. That is the potential for new meaningful product flow, attractive markets, R&D and commercial capabilities and a strong balance sheet.\nAs you know, I started at Incyte very recently, roughly 30 days ago.

The nontrivial challenge Incyte faces is navigating the company through 2029 and transitioning to a new set of durable product growth drivers.\nI believe there's a foundation in place and a path to value creation, but time is of the essence. The nontrivial challenge Incyte faces is navigating the company through 2029 and transitioning to a new set of durable product growth drivers.\nOn the potential for meaningful new product flow, Incyte has several important product launches between now and 2030. These products, of course, will vary in size. Some will contribute substantially and others incrementally to growth. But either way, there is substrate here. Marketed products Opzelura, Niktimvo, MONJUVI and pipeline compounds like 989, our mutant-CALR, monoclonal antibody and parvacitinib, our JAK1 specific inhibitor, have the potential to drive future sales growth and form the company's core. More work remains, of course, but we've made progress with these compounds scientifically and commercially. Opzelura is showing strong broad-based growth today across AD and Vitiligo, has close to 20,000 prescribers and has the potential for new indications in the coming years.\nOn the potential for meaningful new product flow, Incyte has several important product launches between now and 2030.

Phase I results with 989 and ET are promising, and we will share data on MF at the end of the year. And finally, provacitinib could support at least 3 different indications. Next, Incyte operates in 2 of the most structurally attractive markets in the industry: hematology oncology and immunology. They're built on solid foundations of science, need and opportunity and we have differentiated knowledge and capabilities in these areas, and we'll focus on them.\nNiktimvo is off to a very strong start.

We intend to build a comprehensive plan for acceleration that goes beyond just filling a revenue gap. We'll take a fresh look at this business, including our R&D productivity, operating expenses and capital allocation and dedicate resources to accelerating product flow and growth.\nNow regarding our strategic priorities, here's my initial thinking, and I will come back to you in the coming months with more specifics on the direction we plan to take the company strategically, operationally and financially.

We'll take a fresh look at this business, including our R&D productivity, operating expenses and capital allocation and dedicate resources to accelerating product flow and growth.\nMy framework for the business will likely have the following set of priorities. First, take care of the core, that's straightforward, driving utilization of our major products in the short term is necessary for long-term success. Second, accelerate product development. Pablo and I have spent many hours on this topic. It's almost all we talk about. Our mid- to late-stage pipeline has the potential to unlock the next phase of growth for Incyte but there are still unanswered questions, which is not uncommon. 989 is arguably the most scientifically promising asset in the MPN space. as a targeted mutation-specific approach.\nMy framework for the business will likely have the following set of priorities.

If we're successful, 989 should trigger a fundamental shift in the treatment of MPNs like we've seen in other cancers.\nOur success will depend on translating early Phase I data into a regulatory approval and a marketed product, the medical need and the market potential for 989 is significant. If we're successful, 989 should trigger a fundamental shift in the treatment of MPNs like we've seen in other cancers.\nFor povacitinib, we have a clear incredible path to turning this into a major product for Incyte. Its success will be predicated on execution in areas where povacitinib can have differentiation such as HS, PN and Vitiligo. In HS, povocitinib could be the first oral option, which is perhaps the most challenging disease in dermatology. It's not like IL-3 mediate psoriasis or L413-mediated AD. It's more complex, involves more pathways, treatment success is variable. And so a new treatment option like povacitinib should be very marketable.\nFor povacitinib, we have a clear incredible path to turning this into a major product for Incyte.

But as you know, early-stage projects inherently involve uncertainties. We will be continuously assessing these and other programs. They'll be put through a framework to be scored and compared to other programs based on strategic importance, PTRS, commercial potential and return on investment. And I recognize that every use of capital, R&D capital is an opportunity cost for other users.\nAs it relates to our early-stage pipeline, the scientific rationale behind CDK2, G12D, TGFßR2xPD-1 for select solid tumors, among others, is strong.

And I recognize that every use of capital, R&D capital is an opportunity cost for other users.\nThird, capital allocation. We're generating significant cash flow and have a growing balance sheet. The first call on capital will be the core business, our marketed products. The second is the late-stage pipeline and the third is business development. Sometimes our best investments will be inside the company. And other times, the reverse will be true. We'll have a governance mechanism for allocating capital internally and externally to ensure long-term growth and maximize shareholder value.\nThird, capital allocation.

We'll have a governance mechanism for allocating capital internally and externally to ensure long-term growth and maximize shareholder value.\nRegarding business development, we'll look hard at finding derisked pre-revenue or revenue stage opportunities. As you know, there are very few positive asymmetrical opportunities out there, and it's easy to mistakenly turn $1.50. We'll be careful about where and how much capital we put to work. But when strategically sourced appropriately priced and well executed, BD can create a lot of value. We will have a well-defined framework for BD, and we will look for opportunities that fit that framework.\nRegarding business development, we'll look hard at finding derisked pre-revenue or revenue stage opportunities.

We will have a well-defined framework for BD, and we will look for opportunities that fit that framework.\nFinally, it's important to keep a close eye on execution, converting science and strategic plans to results is the job. We'll run the business at a detailed level, enhance the quality and speed of decision-making inside the company and manage our expenses in a disciplined way, which means focusing on doing more with less versus more with more. I look forward to sharing more details on our strategic framework later this year.\nFinally, it's important to keep a close eye on execution, converting science and strategic plans to results is the job.

Jakafi demand remains very strong across 3 indications. Opzelura growth was exceptional across 2 indications, and the Niktimvo launch is exceeding expectations with rapid adoption among BMT centers, reinforcing its commercial potential. The growth prospects for these products are excellent if we continue to execute.\nNow moving to our second quarter results, which Christiana will review next.

We will release Phase I data on 989 and MF at the end of the year to supplement the data we presented at EHA in ET. We expect an FDA approval for Opzelura in pediatric patients 2 to 11 years of age with mild to moderate AD in September. And importantly, the pivotal trials for povacitinib and vitiligo and PN and combination trials with axatilimab and GVHD are enrolling on track.\nOn the R&D front, we made excellent progress.

In Q2, we delivered strong financial results with total product revenues of $1.06 billion, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year, driven by continued demand growth for Jakafi and Opzelura as well as the contribution from the ongoing commercial launch of Niktimvo. Total revenues were $1.22 billion, up 16% versus the same period last year.\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

Total revenues were $1.22 billion, up 16% versus the same period last year.\nTurning to Jakafi on Slide 9. Jakafi net product revenue was $764 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% growth year-over-year, driven by paid demand, which also increased 8% versus the prior year period. Demand for Jakafi continued to grow across all indications. Channel inventory levels ended the quarter with a normal range. As a result of the strong demand in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance for Jakafi to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.\nTurning to Jakafi on Slide 9.

Total net product revenue for the second quarter was $164 million, representing a 35% increase year-over-year. U.S. net product revenue of $132 million was up 19% year-over-year, driven by increased patient demand and refills in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. Channel inventory levels ended the quarter with a normal range. Ex U.S. net product revenues of $32 million loss were driven by continued uptake in France and Germany as well as the recent launches in Italy, Spain and Canada. In France and Italy, Opzelura has seen very rapid adoption.\nTurning now to Opzelura on Slide 10.

Niktimvo net product revenues in the second quarter were $36 million, driven by high patient need and strong commercial execution. We continue to see positive launch metrics with widespread product awareness and interest. We have achieved roughly 82% account penetration with rapid and broad uptake in BMT centers across the U.S.\nTurning to Slide 11 and Niktimvo launch.

We continue to see positive launch metrics with widespread product awareness and interest. We have achieved roughly 82% account penetration with rapid and broad uptake in BMT centers across the U.S.\nSince the beginning of the launch, over 4,000 infusions have been administered to an estimated 700 patients, representing approximately 10% of the third line plus GVHD market. Of all the patients that went on Niktimvo, approximately 80% to 90% remain on therapy today.\nSince the beginning of the launch, over 4,000 infusions have been administered to an estimated 700 patients, representing approximately 10% of the third line plus GVHD market.

Net product revenues for the second quarter were $131 million, representing a 66% year-over-year increase. This is primarily driven by the commercial launch of Niktimvo as well as increased contribution from ZYNYZ following the approval in ICAC. As a result of the strength of the Niktimvo launch, higher demand for ZYNYZ and the earlier than anticipated approval for MONJUVI in FL, we are raising our full year revenue guidance for other oncology products to a new range of $500 million to $520 million.\nTurning now to other hematology/oncology products on Slide 12.

During the second quarter, we recorded a benefit of $242 million from the contract dispute settlement with Novartis, relating to Jakafi royalty payments through the first quarter of 2025. The settlement also resulted in a reduction in COGS, driven by an ongoing 50% reduction in the royalty rate payable to Novartis. As a result, we are reducing the lower end of our COGS guidance. The revised guidance range is now 8% to 9% of net product revenues.\nMoving on to Slide 13 and our operating expenses.

Total R&D expenses on a GAAP basis were $495 million for the second quarter, excluding the onetime [indiscernible] cost in 2024 and other onetime expenses in both years, R&D expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven by continued investment in our late-stage development assets. In the first half of the year, we entered into 2 new development collaborations with Genesys and Biotherixs. As a result of the upfront and ongoing expenses related to these new collaborations we are increasing our full year guidance for R&D by $35 million to a new range of $1.965 billion to $1.995 billion.\nShifting now to R&D.

Total GAAP SG&A expenses were $331 million for the second quarter. Excluding the onetime costs for the prior year, GAAP SG&A expenses increased 16% year-over-year primarily driven by increased legal costs related to the Novartis contract dispute settlement and other matters and timing of certain consumer marketing activities. Finally, we continue to execute on our commitment to grow operating expenses at a slower pace than revenues. Ongoing operating expenses in the second quarter of 2025 increased 13% year-over-year compared to a 16% increase in revenues during the same period, leading to continued increase in operating leverage and margins. Given the very strong performance of our commercial portfolio in the first half of the year, and based on our updated guidance for the year, we expect net product revenues for the full year to grow at a rate of 14% to 17% year-over-year and ongoing operating expenses to grow at a rate of 5% to 7%, leading to further expansion in operating margins.\nMoving to SG&A.

Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Christiana, and good morning, everyone. As we highlighted a year ago when we summarized on this slide, our portfolio remains on track to deliver more than 10 launches by 2030. Moving to Slide 16. The Phase I data in essential thrombocytemia for INCA-C339a9, our mutant-CALR monoclonal antibody was presented at EHA 2025. 9a9 is the first truly targeted therapy for a subset of patients with MPNs that includes 25% of patients with essential thrombocytemia and 35% of patients with myelofibrosis.\nThank you, Christiana, and good morning, everyone.

It is very reassuring that at this point in the development of 9a9, it appears to have an excellent safety profile. We also observed rapid and sustained reductions in VIF in most patients despite the short follow-up for patients in the highest dose cohorts. We believe this data will continue to improve as it matures, delivering an important outcome for patients.\nImportantly, this data set demonstrated the normalization of platelet counts in patients with ET, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of 9a9 and a key point of differentiation from ceroductive therapies. 9a9 was very well tolerated with only one out of 49 patients discontinued therapy.

We will advance this program with great urgency with the goal of starting pivotal trials in ET by early 2026. We continue to gather data and have expanded certain dose cohorts to better understand what the optimal doses for further development. We are committed to presenting data in MF as monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib by the end of the year.\nOn Slide 17, let me summarize the key steps for the 9a9 development plan.

Importantly, we continue to develop a subcutaneous formulation, and that work is ongoing. We believe that initially, the IV formulation every 2 weeks is acceptable, but we'll work to advance a subcu in parallel.\nAdditionally, we have established a collaboration with QIAGEN to develop a co-diagnostic across MPN, with an initial focus in CALR mutations.

I'm pleased to share an important update on ruxolitinib cream. As you know, Opzelura currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and in Europe for the treatment of Vitiligo. Today, we announced the top line results from the pivotal Phase III TRuE-AD4 study which evaluated ruxolitinib cream in adult patients with moderate atopic dermatitis with extensive body surface area involvement of 10% to 20% and significantly impair quality of life with a DLQI greater than 10.\nTurning to our dermatology portfolio, starting on Slide 18.

A week ROCK screen demonstrated a vehicle adjusted difference in IGA-TS of 47.6% and a vehicle adjusted difference in EC75 or 51.4% and both highly statistically significant. In addition, the study met all key secondary endpoints, further reinforcing the efficacy profile of Ruxolitinib cream in this patient population.\nI'm happy to report that the TRuE-AD4 study met its co-primary endpoints at week 8 with statistically significantly larger proportion of patients receiving 1.5% rock screen compared to vehicle, achieving both IGA-TS and EC75.

Ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed. This result confirms that ruxolitinib cream is a highly effective treatment option for patients with moderate AD who are eligible for systemic therapies. Based on the results of the study, plans are underway to submit a Type 2 variation for Opzelura in Europe, where there's a strong demand for innovative topical therapies in patients that have failed topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors.\nImportantly, the safety profile observed in TRuE-AD4 was consistent with previously reported data in atopic dermatitis.

Moving to Slide 19 and the near-term opportunities for povarncitinib. We're advancing povocitinib in 3 indications and believe this represents significant opportunities for near-term revenue and long-term value creation. The positive Phase III data in patients with moderate to severe HS, which affects over 300,000 patients in the U.S. will be our first submission for povacitinib and will support worldwide regulatory filings in 2026.\nLooking ahead, we plan to present the full Phase III top line results at an upcoming medical meeting, and we look forward to engaging with regulators to discuss next steps for potential label expansion.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Schutzer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Greg.\n\nGreg Shertzer\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website to find the press release related financial tables and slides that follow today's discussion. On today's call, I'm joined by Herve, Pablo and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks, Matteo, Mohamad and Stephen will also be available for the Q&A. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. I'll now hand the call over to Herve.\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter of '25 was very important for Incyte not only because of the good performance of the commercial portfolio, but mostly because Q1 '25 puts us on a great trajectory for long-term growth with the continuous expansion of a the successful launch of Niktimvo and the successes of the [indiscernible] pivotal studies in HS and proof-of-concept study CSU. The financial performance was very strong with growth above 20% in both product and total revenues. Our cash position at the end of the quarter reached $2.4 billion. On the commercial side, Niktimvo's successful launch is 1 of the 4 planned launches for Incyte in 2025 in the U.S.\nOn the R&D front, we report significant progress so far this year with several key data positive readout, XR bioequivalents for ruxolitinib, proof-of-concept data in [indiscernible] for Povo and Phase III results for ruxolitinib [indiscernible] and povarcitinib in HS. In Q1, product revenue grew 26% with total revenues increasing 20% year-over-year to $1.05 billion. This growth was driven by the ongoing demand for Jakafi and Opzelura and the initial launch of Niktimvo in third line chronic GVHD.\nMoving to Slide 7 and the first quarter commercial performance for Jakafi. Jakafi net product revenue in the first quarter grew 24% year-over-year to $709 million. Total patients increased 10% when compared to the same quarter in 2024. due to strong demand and the expected continued growth of Jakafi, we are raising the full year '25 net product revenue guidance to a new range of $2.95 billion to $3 billion.\nTurning to Slide 8 and looking at Jakafi weekly dispenses by indication during '23, '24 and the first quarter of 2025. As you can see, unit growth remains robust across all 3 indications. Myelofibrosis showed growth again this quarter, while the most significant increase was seen in polycythemia vera. We expect TB to become the largest contributor for Jakafi over time, supported by the data from the [indiscernible] study, which underscores the benefit of early intervention with Jakafi and its impact on thrombosis free survival. Moving to Opzelura on Slide 9. Total Opzelura net product revenue in the first quarter were $119 million, up 38% when compared to the same quarter last year driven by continued growth in the U.S., increased contribution from Germany and France and the more recent launches in Italy and Spain. In the U.S., the annual prescription trends for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, as shown on the right of Slide 9 reflects continued growth of Opzelura for both atopic dermatitis and [indiscernible] . Effective March 1, Optum premium added Opera to their preferred formulary, which means Opzelura is now preferred on 2 out of the 3 big PBM national formularies.\nThis change has enhanced our commercial coverage from 86% to 94%. On Slide 10 and our newest commercial product, Niktimvo. Niktimvo is the seventh product commercialized directly by Incyte after Jakafi, Opzelura, [indiscernible], Monjuvi and Diniz. This nobel medicine launched at the end of January for patients with third line chronic [indiscernible] versus host disease addresses an important medical need, and it has significant long-term growth potential. After 2 months of commercialization, Niktimvo net product revenues in the first quarter were $14 million, driven by high patient need and strong commercial execution, along with our partner, Syndax. We are seeing positive early launch metrics with widespread product awareness and interest. 94% top BMT centers are used Niktimvo, and 70% of all BMT centers have ordered. Niktimvo is the first anti-CSF-1R antibody approved to target the inflammation and fibrosis associated with chronic GVSD, and we are already seeing the impact it is having for patients, giving us increased optimism for the long-term potential of this product as it is moving to earlier line of treatment.\nOn Slide 11, a reminder that 2025 will be a pivotal year for Incyte with numerous defining catalysts set to create a significant inflection point. the launch of in strong initial success, and we are preparing for 3 additional launches this year, collectively offering important near-term revenue potential. We plan to initiate at least 3 Phase III study, and we anticipate that 7 early-stage programs will generate informative. These developments have the potential to transform our company.\nFinally, before I turn the call to Christian, I would like to address the topic of tariffs. 7 years ago, we started the strategy to establish [indiscernible] for Key Insight product with the goal of having backup FDA or EMA approved facility in case of technical issues. This approach is giving us today flexibility for products to manufacture in the U.S. for the U.S. market and for Europe, from Europe for ex U.S. Therefore, we expect the impact to Incyte of any potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals to be minimal. Finally, our exposure to China is now limited to some starting material for some of our drugs and we currently hold inventory of starting material to support our forecasted supply needs over a multiyear period and have alternative sources of supply of starting materials that we could consider linked to if needed. Now I will hand over the call to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Herve, and good morning. In the first quarter of 2025, we delivered total revenues of $1.5 billion, up 20% versus the same period last year. Total product revenues of $922 million in the first quarter represent an increase of 26% year-over-year, driven by strong demand growth for Jakafi and Opselura as well as initial contribution from the commercial launch of Niktimvo during the quarter. Turning to Jakafi on Slide 16. Jakafi net product revenue was $709 million for the first quarter, representing 24% growth versus the first quarter of 2024. Paid demand increased 10% versus the prior year period, reflecting continued growth in all indications. .\nNet product revenue growth also reflects a positive gross to net impact from the removal of the Part D coverage gap liability under the inflation Reduction Act and Incyte phase in participation in the Part D initial and casastrophic phases, partially offset by growth in 340B. As a result of Jakafi qualifying for the small biotech exception, Incyte's participation in the Part D coverage is limited to 1% in both the initial and catastrophic phases in 2025. We expect this gross to net favorability for Part D to be limited to 1, and for the remaining quarters in 2025, we expect the Part D coverage liability to be in line with 2024. Lastly, the year-over-year comparison of net product revenue includes a 7% positive impact due to less destocking in the first quarter of 2025 versus the first quarter of 2024.\nAt the end of Q1 2025, Jakafi inventory levels were within normal range. Turning now to Opzelura on Slide 17. Net product revenue for the first quarter was $119 million, representing a 38% increase year-over-year. U.S. net product revenue of $95 million was up 20% year-over-year, driven by a 24% increase in paid demand, partially offset by a reduction in channel inventory. Channel inventory levels ended the quarter within normal range. Ex U.S. network product revenues of $23 million were driven by continued uptake in Germany and France as well as the recent launches in Italy and Spain.\nTurning to Slide 18. As in prior years, Opzelura first quarter results reflect the typical seasonality we see in the first quarter of each year driven by the reset of insurance plan annual deductible in the U.S. as well as holidays and other events that negatively impact scripts. Turning now to other hematology/oncology products on Slide 19. Net product revenues for the first quarter were $94 million, representing a 30% increase year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the commercial launch of Niktimvo during the first quarter of 2025 and which contributed $14 million in net product sales. Growth from Monjuvi in the first quarter of the year primarily reflects a full quarter of Incyte recording net product revenues in the U.S. versus 2 months of net product revenues in 2024 as a result of the acquisition of the exclusive U.S. rights to Monjuvi that closed in February 2024.\nMoving on to Slide 20 and operating expenses. Total GAAP R&D expenses were $437 million for the first quarter an increase of 2% year-over-year, driven by continued investment in our late-stage development assets, offset by the timing of certain expenses, which favorably impacted Q1 2025. Moving to SG&A. Total GAAP SG&A expenses were $326 million for the first quarter, representing an 8% year-over-year increase primarily driven by timing of consumer marketing expenses and certain other expenses. Finally, total ongoing operating expenses in the first quarter of 2025 increased 6% year-over-year compared to a 20% increase in revenues during the same period, leading to further increasing operating leverage and margins.\nMoving on to our guidance for 2025. We are increasing our full year guidance for Jakafi from a range of $2.95 billion to $2.975 billion to a new range of $2.95 billion to $3 billion. We are reiterating our full year guidance for Opelura, our other hematology/oncology products, [COGS R&D and G&A]. For R&D, our guidance excludes the impact of the recent deal we signed with Genesis, which is expected to add $15 million to our full year R&D spend. I'll now turn the call to Pablo for an R&D update.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. As we highlighted a year ago and we summarized on this slide, we remain on track to deliver more than 10 high-impact launches by 2030 from programs across the portfolio. In the next few slides, I would like to provide an update on 2 of these programs. The Phase II proof-of-concept study of pobarsitinib in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria with an update on the Phase III results for pobarcitinib in patients with hydronitis/suprativa. We're delighted to announce that policy top line results for the Phase II study evaluating pobarcitinib in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. The study met the primary endpoint at the 75-milligram dose of change from baseline in the urticaria activity score summed over 7 days or US 7 at week 12. Treatment with Povorcitinib was well tolerated with no new safety signals observed. These results open the door to a potentially new treatment option for over 300,000 patients with CSU who are inadequately controlled on antihistamines. .\nWe're pleased with this proof-of-concept results, which will be presented in an upcoming medical conference, and we will be engaging with regulatory agencies to determine next steps as we plan a pivotal study for Povorcitinib in patients with CSU. Just a few weeks ago, we presented the results of the Phase III studies, STOP HS1 and STOP HS2, evaluating Povorcitinib in patients with moderate to severe HS. The studies showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in HiSCR at both doses in both studies. Slides 25 and 26 summarize updated results through 18 weeks of follow-up in these 2 studies. As a reminder, patients on placebo were allowed to cross over at week 12 and were randomized to either 45 or 75 milligrams of Povorcitinib. As illustrated in the chart, for those patients who started on Povorcitinib in STOP HS1, the number of patients achieving HiSCR increase from 176 at week 12 to 203 by week 18.\nAmong the patients who crossed over from placebo to receive either povercidniy 45 or 75 milligrams for a week 18 improved from 28.6% on placebo to 57.1% and 57.8%, respectively. Importantly, for the crossover patients, the number of responders increased from 58 to 100 in just 6 weeks, demonstrating once again the rapid onset of benefit produced by Povorcitinib in patients with HS. Similar findings are observed in STOP HS1 summarized on this slide. For those patients who started on Povorcitinib the number and proportion of patients achieving HiSCR continues to increase from 164 patients at week 12 to 177 patients at week 18. Among the patients who crossed over from placebo to receive either Povorcitinib 45 or 75 milligrams, HiSCR week 18 improved from 29.7% on placebo to 58% and 55.2%, respectively, while the number of those achieving HiSCR increased from 60 to 99.\nThis week 18 results from both STOP HS 1 and STOP HS2 clearly show that the response rates in the Povorcitinib arms continue to increase over time. And perhaps more importantly, demonstrated doubling of the responses in patients initially randomized to placebo after they were switched to the Povorcitinib dose level. We previously reported a greater differential efficacy in favor of baracitinib in patients previously treated with biologics with an average placebo-adjusted difference in HiSCR 19.1% for Povorcitinib 45 milligrams and 18.3% for Povorcitinib 75 milligrams in the pooled analysis for STOP HS1 and STOP HS2.\nIn Slides 27 and 28 in show that this is true regardless of the type of biologic being considered, either anti-TNF or entire [indiscernible] agents. Shown on this slide is a HiSCR score by prior anti-TNF therapy with a placebo subtracted high score of 13% to 23% in the different arms of these 2 studies. On Slide 28, we see the HiSCR by prior anti-IL-17 therapy with a placebo subtracted HiSCR of 5% to 25% in favor of Povorcitinib treated patients. In all, the totality of the data presented clearly demonstrates that patients with HS have the potential to benefit from Povorcitinib therapy regardless of whether they have received treatment with a biologic and regardless of the type of biologic they received. We're pleased by the positive data that Povorcitinib continues to generate. With positive Phase III data for HS, positive Phase II proof-of-concept data previously presented for vitiligo, prurigo nodularis, and now CSU, over Povorcitinib solidifies itself as a potential new medicine across several indications in development. We're executing a broad development plan and anticipate additional proof-of-concept data for asthma to be available in the second half of 2025. We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for Povorcitinib and and plan to share this update in the second half of 2025. As mentioned by Herve, 2025 will be a pivotal year for Incyte with over 18 key milestones, including 4 new product launches, 4 pivotal trial readouts, at least 3 Phase III study initiations and 7 proof-of-concept study results. As you can see on Slide 32, we have achieved several of these milestones with the launch of Niktimvo bioequivalency data for ruxolitinib extended release Phase III data for ruxolitinib cream in prurigo nodularis and Povorcitinib [indiscernible] as well as the Phase II proof-of-concept data for CSU. We look forward to sharing additional updates on these milestones over the course of 2025. I will now hand the call over to Herve for closing remarks.\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nYes. Thank you. Before we close the presentation following Pablo's update on the Povo data in HS, when Povo will be launched. It's a fast-growing market where there are more than 100,000 diagnosed patients with moderate and severe HS who do not yet receive advanced systemic therapies. The illustration on Slide 32 reflects the group of patients on systemic therapy. There are around 3,000 patients who are not eligible for injectable treatment with biologics as research shows that 10% to 15% of eligible diagnosis patients are not receiving injectable therapy for practical financial reasons or at the patient's request. Povo will be the only oral treatment approved in the pre-biologic setting, and we anticipate this segment to grow significantly in the years following the approval of Povorcitinib. In 2027, Povo will compete for the 16,000 new biologic eligible patients started on systemic therapies that year in dark blue on the graph with a competitive product profile based on an oral treatment with high HiSCR durable responses and fast pain release. .\nThe largest segment at launch in 2027 will be the group of patients in light blue on the right, who have received biologic treatment, including anti-IL-17 and require a new treatment option for lack of good disease control. We estimate that group at 27,000 patients or around 1/3 of a pool of 74,000 patients on biologics that year. This is equivalent to an estimate of average biologic treatment duration of 3 years. In this patient population, as Pablo has presented earlier, Povorcitinib efficacy profile is unique and will drive the early adoption curve. Overall, this estimate shows that Povorcitinib will be potentially targeting 46,000 HS patients in 2027. With a longer-term data today for new patients with efficacy data maintained in the post-biologic selling, we see HS as an important contributor to the total potential of Povorcitinib with vitiligo, prurigo nodularis, and now CSU as a subsequent indication.\nTo recap, we are -- we have delivered a very strong commercial execution in the first quarter in both oncology and dermatology. The successful launch of Niktimvo demonstrates that there is a clear need for new treatments in GVHD, giving us optimism for the long-term potential of Niktimvo. This quarter is when we confirm that Povo will be potentially launched in 2027 for HS with positive data on all primary endpoints in both Phase III studies, a competitive profile in treatment naive and post biologic HS and now proof of concept in CSU. This results reinforced Povorcitinib potential as a multibillion driver of future growth for our company. Our pipeline continues to advance with short-term deliverable for 3 additional launches in 2025, [indiscernible] in 2026 and good progress of the earlier project. And importantly, we have multiple upcoming milestones and catalysts remaining in 2025, which will further shape our trajectory and create additional value. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instruction and open the call for Q&A. .",

[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ben Strain, Associate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ben.\n\nBen Strain\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides that follow today's discussion.\nOn today's call, I'm joined by Herve, Pablo, Christiana, who will deliver the prepared remarks. Matteo and Steven will also be available for Q&A.\nI would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. I will now hand the call over to Herve.\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong year with 2024 total revenues growing 15% versus 2023 to reach $4.2 billion, continuing the steady growth we have delivered since 2020. In addition to the consistent performance of Jakafi in 2024, we saw strong growth from our non-Jakafi revenue, primarily driven by Opzelura, highlighting our continuing revenue diversification.\nMoving to Slide 6. 2024 Jakafi net sales were $2.8 billion, growing 8% versus the prior year with growth coming from all indications. Opzelura saw strong continued momentum in 2024, growing 50% to $58 million, driven by both new patients and refills in [ AD ] and vitiligo in the U.S. and expanding reimbursement outside the U.S. We expect Opzelura to continue to be a key contributor to growth in the next year.\nOur cash flow remains strong, which allowed us to complete $2 billion share repurchase during 2024 while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended 2024 with $2.2 billion in cash and no debt. We are in a very strong financial position with growing revenues and a robust pipeline that will deliver a number of very exciting readouts in 2025.\nLast month, we and our partner, Syndax, announced that the FDA approved Niktimvo in 9-milligram and 22-milligram vial sizes, paving the way for the commercial launch. This medicine is now available in the U.S. and the commercial launch is underway. Niktimvo is the first anti-CSF-1R antibody approved to target the inflammation and fibrosis associated with chronic GVHD. And we are excited to bring this new therapy to approximately 6,000 patients who are currently treated after second-line therapy in the U.S.\nIn addition to the launch of Niktimvo, the sNDA for ruxolitinib cream in pediatric atopic dermatitis was filed with the FDA, and we are on track for potential approval in the second half of 2025. With 2 million to 3 million pediatric patients in the U.S. suffering from atopic dermatitis, we see significant opportunity for ruxolitinib cream with its compelling efficacy in controlling itch to address an important need for this patient population.\nWe submitted pivotal study results to the FDA for both tafasitamab in follicular lymphoma and retifanlimab in squamous cell anal carcinoma and anticipate approvals for both in the second half of 2025. These product launches are expected to begin contributing to revenue in the near term with the potential to collectively generate $1 billion in incremental revenues by 2029, further [indiscernible] our revenue.\nWe anticipate all 4 products to be available in '25 and we will be leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure established for Jakafi, Opzelura, Monjuvi and Pemazyre, to support the launches of these new products or indications.\nMoving to Slide 9. An update of the fourth quarter and full year 2024 commercial performance for Jakafi. In the fourth quarter, Jakafi net product revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $773 million and grew 8% for the full year to $2.8 billion. Total patients increased 10% in Q4 when compared to the same quarter in 2023. Importantly, growth is being seen across all indications, but with particular strength in [ PV ] with this indication now accounting for 35% of the patients on Jakafi. We expect continued growth of Jakafi in 2025 and expect the full year net product revenue for 2025 to be in the range of $2.925 billion to $2.975 billion.\nTurning to Slide 10 and looking at Jakafi total paid demand by indication during 2022, '23 and 2024. As you can see, unit growth remains robust. Myelofibrosis showed growth again this quarter, while the most significant growth was seen in polycythemia vera. We expect PV to become the largest contributor for Jakafi over time, supported by the data from the MAGIC PV study, which underscores the benefit of early intervention with Jakafi and its impact on thrombosis-free survival.\nMoving to Opzelura on Slide 11. Opzelura net product revenue in the fourth quarter was $162 million, up 48% when compared to the same quarter last year, and this was comprised of $138 million in the U.S. driven by growth in AD and Vitiligo new patients and refills, and $24 million ex U.S. driven by growth in Germany and France.\nTotal 2024 full year net revenue grew 50% versus 2023 to reach $508 million. In the U.S., the annual prescription trends for 2022, '23 and '24, as shown on the right of Slide 11, reflects continued year-over-year growth of Opzelura from both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. We anticipate continued growth of Opzelura in 2025 and expect the full year net product revenue to be in the range of $630 million to $670 million.\nOn Slide 12. So 2025 will be a year of defining catalysts that will provide an inflection point for Incyte. As you can see highlighted on Slide 12, every program has meaningful milestone expected in 2025. This includes 4 potential launches collectively providing important near-term revenue potential where the launch of Niktimvo is already underway, as I just highlighted.\nAdditionally, we plan to initiate at least 3 Phase III studies, including our BET inhibitor, RUX cream in mild to jmoderate HS and our CDK2 inhibitor in ovarian cancer.\nWe expect 2025 will be a data-rich year with 4 pivotal data readouts, including ruxolitinib XR, which Pablo will highlight shortly. More importantly, we expect 7 early-stage programs to generate informative data, which we believe have the potential to transform the company.\nBefore I hand the call over to Pablo, I would like to provide the leadership update for our commercial organization. After a remarkable decade of dedicated service to Incyte, Barry Flannelly has decided to retire from his role as Executive Vice President, Head of U.S. Oncology. We are pleased to announce that Mohamed Issa assumed Barry's role in January, and Mohamed successfully led U.S. commercial teams in oncology, immunology and neuroscience most recently at J&J.\nI will now turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Herve, and good morning. As we highlighted a year ago and we summarized on this slide, we remain on track to deliver more than 10 high-impact launches by 2030 from programs across the portfolio.\nOn Slide 15, I would like to quickly highlight some of the key accomplishments during 2024, and I will then cover some of the milestones expected in 2025. We had a number of important regulatory achievements in 2024, including the approval of Niktimvo for third line plus chronic graft versus host disease, and 3 submissions to the FDA with expected approvals later this year. including Opzelura in pediatric atopic dermatitis, retifanlimab in SCAC and tafasitamab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. We disclosed data from our CDK2 inhibitor and BET inhibitor programs and provided pivotal study plans for both, which we anticipate initiating this year.\nWe continue to evolve at R&D focused with the intent of increasing the rigor of our decision-making, accelerating the progression of our pipeline and optimizing our resource allocation.\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2024, we presented data at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, or ASH, from both our BET inhibitor program and Phase III results for tafasitamab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The Phase III results of tafasitamab in follicular lymphoma were presented at a late-breaking session and show that the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. This was, to our knowledge, the first study to validate the combination of an anti-CD19 with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in patients with follicular lymphoma. Tafasitamab was generally well tolerated and safety was consistent with its known safety profile. This data has been submitted to the FDA and approval is expected in the second half of 2025.\nFor our BET inhibitor, we shared additional data from the ongoing dose escalation study as both monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib. These results show reductions in spleen volume as well as improvements in both symptoms and hemoglobin. As highlighted on this slide, we plan to advance this program into Phase III development as a monotherapy in the post-JAK population, and we look forward to providing additional details later this year.\nMoving to Slide 18. We are continuing to execute a broad development plan for povorcitinib, our oral small molecule, highly selective JAK1 inhibitor. Povorcitinib is currently being evaluated in Phase III studies in hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and prurigo nodularis and in randomized Phase II proof-of-concept studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria and asthma with data for both expected in 2025.\nPovorcitinib has already shown encouraging efficacy and safety in a randomized Phase II study in patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, a highly painful inflammatory condition. As highlighted on the right side of the Slide 19, povorcitinib showed significant responses by week 12, including improvements in HiSCR50, 90 and 100. Additionally, povorcitinib demonstrated a rapid and significant reduction in pain, offering the potential to transform the current standard of care for this disease. The 2 Phase III studies, STOP-HS1 and STOP-HS2 are fully enrolled, and we expect to have Phase III data in the first half of this year.\nTurning to the mutant-CALR antibody program on Slide 20. The publication detailing our mutant-CALR monoclonal antibody was recently featured on the cover of Blood, highlighting the importance of this innovative medicine. This antibody was developed entirely by Incyte, and unlike Jakafi, the mutant color antibody has the potential to eliminate the mutant clone and normalized hematopoiesis in patients with CALR mutated essential thrombocytopenia or myelofibrosis, potentially leading to a functional cure. We look forward to sharing data from the ongoing proof-of-concept studies in both ET and MF later this year.\nTurning to Slide 21, in ruxolitinib XR. We're pleased to announce that a bioequivalency study of ruxolitinib 55 milligrams extended release demonstrated the once-a-day formulation to be bioequivalent to twice a day ruxolitinib. Bioequivalence was achieved for both AUC and Cmin and the geometric means ratios falling within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence reference range. We have reviewed this data with the FDA, and with their agreement, plan to submit for approval by the end of the year on stability studies are completed.\nAs mentioned, 2025 will be an important year for Incyte with over 18 key milestones, including 4 new product launches, 4 pivotal trial readouts, at least 3 Phase III study initiations and 7 proof-of-concept study results. As you can see on Slide 22, we have already achieved 2 of these milestones that we first highlighted just last month with the launch of Niktimvo and bioequivalency data for ruxolitinib extended release.\nWe look forward to sharing additional updates on this milestone over the course of 2025. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter 2024 results reflect strong commercial execution and continued growth with total revenues of $1.2 billion, up 16% versus the same period last year. Total product revenues of $1 billion in Q4 were driven by strong demand growth for Jakafi and Opzelura and increased revenue contribution from Monjuvi as a result of the acquisition of full rights to tafasitamab in 2024. Total royalty revenues were $159 million, up 6% compared to Q4 2023 driven by increased demand for Jakavi. Jakavi.\nTurning to Jakafi on Slide 26. Jakafi net product revenue was driven by strong patient demand growth across all indications. In the fourth quarter of 2024, net product revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by a 9% increase in total demand and a 14% increase in paid demand. For the full year 2024, net product revenue increased 8% versus 2023, driven by a 7% increase in total demand and a 9% increase in paid demand.\nRecall that in Q3 and Q4 2023, we saw a significant increase in the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving free product. As we anticipated, these patients returned to paid demand in 2024. As a result, year-over-year, paid demand growth exceeded total demand growth in both the fourth quarter and full year 2024.\nTurning now to Opzelura on Slide 27. Total net product revenue for the fourth quarter was $162 million, representing a 48% increase year-over-year, driven by growth in new patient starts and refills across both AD and vitiligo in the U.S. as well as continued contribution from the commercialization of Opzelura for vitiligo in Europe. In the fourth quarter, ex U.S. Opzelura net product revenue was $24 million. For the full year, net product revenue was $508 million, representing a 50% increase year-over-year and ex U.S. net product revenue was $61 million.\nMoving on to Slide 28 in our operating expenses. Total GAAP R&D expenses for the fourth quarter were $466 million, an increase of 5% compared to the same period in '23 due to continued investment in our late-stage development assets and timing of certain expenses. For the full year 2024, ongoing R&D expenses, excluding the Escient acquisition upfront consideration and other onetime expenses increased 14% year-over-year as a result of increased investment in our late-stage programs.\nAs we wrap up the clinical development of certain of these programs as well as the development activities of discontinued programs, we anticipate the reduction in investment in those programs to partially offset the increased investment in other programs, which would allow us to control future R&D expense growth.\nMoving to SG&A. Total GAAP SG&A expenses were $327 million for the fourth quarter, representing an 11% year-over-year increase, primarily as a result of Incyte now recording Monjuvi related sales and marketing expenses in the U.S. following the acquisition of global rights to the program in 2024 as well as the timing of consumer marketing activities and certain other expenses. For the full year 2024, total GAAP SG&A expenses increased 7% year-over-year as a result of us now recording Monjuvi related sales and marketing expenses and investment in the launch of Opzelura in Europe and the preparation for new product launches in the U.S. Finally, total ongoing R&D and SG&A expense for the full year increased 10% versus a 15% increase in total revenues, leading to an increase in operating leverage and margins.\nMoving on to 2025. I will now discuss the key components of our guidance on a GAAP basis. For Jakafi, we expect net product revenue to be in the range of $2.925 billion to $2.975 billion, well on track to achieve our long-term guidance of over $3 billion by 2028. We expect net product revenue growth to be driven exclusively by continued demand growth, primarily in PV, and be partially offset by lower net pricing as a result of IRA imposed price increase caps and continued growth in 340B volumes. As in previous years, we expect the gross-to-net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter of the year relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to higher deductibles that are primarily impacting Q1.\nFor Opzelura, we expect total net product revenue to be in the range of $630 million to $670 million driven by continued demand growth in AD and vitiligo in the U.S., initial contribution from the potential launch of Opzelura for pediatric AD expected in the second half of the year and increased contribution from Opzelura for vitiligo in Europe. In the first quarter of the year, we expect to see again the effects of typical Q1 dynamics on net sales due to planned deductibles resetting at the beginning of the year and the impact of holidays medical conferences and other events on dermatology product sales. As a result, Q1 Opzelura net product revenue is expected to be below the previous quarter, consistent with what we saw in 2024.\nFor other oncology products, we expect total net product revenues to be in the range of $415 million to $455 million. This includes contribution from both the current approved indications for Iclusig, Niktimvo, Monjuvi and Minjuvi, Pemazyre and Zynyz as well as the launches of Monjuvi in FL and Zynyz in SCAC anticipated in the second half of 2025.\nTurning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis. We expect COGS to range from 8.5% to 9% of net product revenues. The increase in the COGS rate is driven by certain manufacturing-related expenses and the impact of our profit share agreement with Syndax for Niktimvo in the U.S. Our Syndax's portion of the profit share will be reflected in COGS.\nR&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.93 billion to $1.96 billion primarily driven by the progression of our pipeline. We expect SG&A expenses for the year to be in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.31 billion.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.",

If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star-zero on your telephone keypad. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. In the interest of time, may I ask you to please limit yourselves to one question? You may be placed in the question queue at any time by pressing star-1 on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ben Strain, Associate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ben.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investor section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides that follow today's discussion. On today's call, I'm joined by Hervé, Pablo and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks. Barry, Steven and Matteo will also be available for Q&A.\n\nI would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC files for additional detail.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Hervé. \n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Ben and good morning, everyone.\n\nSo, during the second quarter of 2024, we made significant progress across the business; with strong performance on the commercial side, driven by JAKAFI and OPZELURA; transformation of our pipeline, where we made important decisions on our clinical program and capital allocation, where we closed the Escient acquisition and completed the large share repurchase. Looking at Q2 revenue--total revenue grew 9% year-over-year, exceeding $1 billion, while net product revenue grew 10% driven by the continued success of JAKAFI and OPZELURA, which I will detail in the following slide.\n\nWe continue to make strategic decisions that are transforming our clinical pipeline and during the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals--which added two first-in-class medicines to our IAI portfolio. Additionally, we are intensifying our focus on and concentrating resources on those highest potential program which have the largest impact for patients and for Incyte. We also recently completed a large, $2 billion share repurchase, further highlighting our excitement and conviction in our clinical pipeline and commercial business while retaining a strong balance sheet for potential further business development activities.\n\nOver the last 12 months, our clinical pipeline has significantly advanced and we are on track to deliver a number of best-in-class and/or first-in-class differentiated medicines in areas where there are no or limited treatment options. When comparing our pipeline today--on slide six--to where we were just seven months ago, we have added potentially transformative clinical programs--including KRASG12D, TGFß PD-1, MRGPRX2 and X4 and we have deprioritized some of the immuno-oncology programs, including TIM-3 and LAG-3 antibodies, LAG-3xPD-1 bispecific and the oral PD-L1 program. Pablo will describe this pipeline transformation in some details and will provide clarity on the potential timing of data availability.\n\nMoving to slide seven. JAKAFI net product revenues were $706 million, up 3% year-over-year. Paid demand increased 9%. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2023 benefited by approximately $37 million from channel inventory, which explains the 3% growth of net sales versus the 9% growth of actual demand. Based on the strength in demand seen during the first half of the year and anticipated growth for the balance of the year, we are raising the bottom end of our full year 2024 JAKAFI net revenue guidance to a new range of $2.71 billion to $2.75 billion. Turning to slide eight.\n\nI'm looking at JAKAFI's total paid demand by indication during the first quarter of 2022, '23 and '24. As you can see, unit growth continues to be strong; MF is stable year-over-year, with modest growth in this quarter and the largest growth coming from both PV and GVHD. JAKAFI continues to maintain its leadership in MF. Based on market research, discontinuation rates have remained stable in the first-line setting over the past several months, with minimal impact on competitor. These trends have been consistent with our expectations. Moving to OPZELURA on slide nine.\n\nTotal OPZELURA net product revenue in the second quarter were $122 million, up 52% when compared to the same quarter last year. The weekly prescription trend, as shown on the right of slide 9, reflects continued growth of OPZELURA in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and U.S. total prescriptions for OPZELURA grew 34% year-over-year, while refills grew 50% year-over-year. From an access perspective, we continue to see encouraging results since OPZELURA moved to earlier positions in certain commercial plans, demonstrating a positive impact to net sales, following the improved access. Moving to slide 10.\n\nDuring the second quarter, we made continuous progress on the re-endorsement of OPZELURA in Europe. OPZELURA is now reimbursed in Germany, France, in Italy and Spain and the $11 million net sales during the second quarter were mostly driven by Germany and France. We expect Spain and Italy to start contributing to revenue beginning in Q3.\n\nAs shown on slide 11, OPZELURA was the first therapy to gain full reimbursement in France through a new process called Accès Direct. This process has accelerated patients' ability to obtain OPZELURA while pricing negotiations were ongoing and were reflected in the increase in revenues seen in Q2.\n\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hervé and good morning, everyone.\n\nSince joining Incyte one year ago, the R&D organization and I have been centered on accelerating the transformation of our pipeline to expand our leadership in treating patients with inflammatory diseases, MPNs, cancer and graft-versus-host disease. By harnessing a culture of rigorous decision-making, intense focus and excellence in execution, we have made considerable progress in advancing our goal of delivering best-in-class and/or first-in-class differentiated medicines in areas where there are no or limited treatment options.\n\nAs a result, we anticipate delivering more than 10 high-impact launches by 2030, several of which are new molecular entities. As Hervé mentioned, we recently completed a strategic review of our pipeline to focus resources on programs with novel biology that hold the highest potential impact for patients. Based on available data, the evolving treatment landscape and the evolution of our internal pipeline, we have decided to discontinue a number of programs, including our oral PD-L1 programs, our LAG-3 monoclonal antibody program, our TIM-3 monoclonal antibody program and our LAG-3xPD-1 bispecific program.\n\nThese data-driven decisions will enable us to fully realize the potential of our pipeline by delivering significant value to patients and our shareholders. With a strong sense of urgency, we plan to achieve a number of important clinical milestones in the coming months. We will advance the development of 12 new molecular entities and we will achieve up to 7 pivotal readouts as well as 8 readouts that will provide proof of concept in new indications for existing programs or for new molecular entities. In the next few slides, I will highlight a number of these programs.\n\nIn inflammation and autoimmunity, we continue to expand the breadth and novelty of our pipeline and expect to deliver multiple data sets beginning this year and beyond. We continue to evaluate the potential of RUXOLITINIB cream and POVORCITINIB across several new indications, including pediatric atopic dermatitis, prurigio nodularis, hydradenitis suppurativa, chronic spontaneous urticaria and asthma.\n\nWith the recent acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals, we have added two potential first-in-class medicines that aim to address a number of debilitating conditions, including chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic inducible urticaria, atopic dermatitis and cholestatic pruritus. We believe that with the introduction of these new medicines for this condition, we will see a greater number of patients seeking treatment who are currently underserved with available therapies or who are currently not receiving treatment.\n\nOn slide 16, we continue to advance the development of RUXOLITINIB cream beyond AD and vitiligo to additional indications where it can provide significant value as either the first-ever FDA-approved therapy or first-approved topical therapy for patients living with these dermatologic conditions. Based on the positive Phase III data in pediatric atopic dermatitis, the supplementary NDA submission is on track to be filed in the third quarter of this year with a potential approval in 2025, which could provide an effective, non-steroidal topical option for the 2 to 3 million pediatric patients with AD in the U.S. In the most severe cases of this inflammatory disorder, pediatric AD may interfere with development, emphasizing the importance of delivering this medicine to these children as soon as possible. Now, turning to slide 17.\n\nWe're currently conducting a Phase III study evaluating RUXOLITINIB cream in patients with prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin disorder that presents as multiple firm nodules commonly located on the extensive surfaces of the extremities and that are intensely pruritic. The studies are going well and we're on track to report results from the pivotal study next year, with a potential approval as early as 2026. With no topical therapies currently approved for PN and over 100,000 patients on treatment, [inaudible] is an important additional option for patients and a significant opportunity for RUXOLITINIB cream.\n\nAs shown on slide 18, we're continuing to execute a broad development plan for POVORCITINIB--our oral, small molecule, highly selective JAK1 inhibitor. POVORCITINIB is currently being evaluated in Phase III studies in hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and prurigo nodularis and in randomized Phase II proof of concept studies in asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria--with data in both expected in 2025.\n\nPOVORCITINIB has already demonstrated outstanding efficacy and safety in a randomized Phase II study in moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, an extremely painful inflammatory disease. As a reminder, we reported that at week 52, up to 29% of patients experienced a HiSCR100 response, which is complete resolution of all manifestations.\n\nPOVORCITINIB also had rapid and profound impact on reducing pain--as highlighted in the chart on the bottom of slide 19--and represents the first potential oral therapy for the treatment of HS, with the opportunity to change the current standard of care. The two Phase III studies--STOP-HS1 and STOP-HS2--are enrolling quite well, given the strong Phase II data and the limited number of effective treatment options. We anticipate Phase III data in early 2025, with a potential launch in 2026. With RUXOLITINIB cream and POVORCITINIB, we believe we will be the only company to potentially provide both a topical and oral option for a number of indications, expanding their momentarium of effective therapies for certain conditions--including HS, vitiligo and prurigo nodularis.\n\nMoving to slide 20 and our two newest IAI programs. We are pleased to have closed the Escient transaction and now add two Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor antagonists--or MRGPRs--to our pipeline, with significant potential in multiple indications. MRGPR antagonism is a specific novel mechanism for blocking mast cell activation, independent from IgE and has been a high-priority target to us for IAI pipeline as a paradigm-changing therapeutic approach. Mast cells play a central role in initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory responses and their dysregulation can contribute to the development and progression of many inflammatory diseases.\n\n262 is a first-in-class medicine which entered the clinic in January of 2023 and is currently being evaluated in three proof of concept clinical studies. By blocking the activation of mast cells, 262 holds great promise across a broad range of mast cell-mediated diseases as a once-daily oral treatment, potentially devoid of the side effects observed with other therapies. As a reminder, in a Phase I healthy volunteer study, 262 was well-tolerated at low interpatient PK variability and achieved exposures well above predicted efficacious levels.\n\nWe believe the excellent safety profile, along with the potential for compelling efficacy, could be a key differentiator for this program. 262 is currently in a Phase Ib open-label study in chronic inducible Urticaria--or CIndU--and in a randomized Phase II study in chronic spontaneous urticaria--or CSU--with data for the studies expected during the first quarter of 2025.\n\nMarked by painful and pruritic hives, CIndU and CSU are currently treated with antihistamines but nearly 50% of patients do not experience symptom control, which can lead to anxiety, depression and inability to work and social isolation--underscoring the need for safe and effective oral therapeutic options. 262 results are currently being evaluated in a randomized Phase II study in atopic dermatitis and data for this study is also expected during the first quarter of 2025. There is continued need for additional safe and effective oral treatment options in AD and we believe success in this indication could further build on our leadership in AD.\n\n547 is a highly selective antagonist of MRGPRX4, a cell-surface receptor expressed on neurons in the dorsal root ganglia that is activated by bile acids, bilirubin and [inaudible] metabolites and thought to be a key mediator of the often intense, unrelenting pruritus experienced by patients with cholestatic liver disease. 547 has the potential to become the first targeted therapy for cholestatic pruritus, lacking the side effects observed with other approaches. A randomized, double-blind study is being conducted in patients with cholestatic pruritis due to primary biliary cirrhosis--or PBC--or primary sclerosing cholangitis--or PSC--with clinical proof of concept anticipated also during the first quarter of 2025.\n\nMoving to MPNs and graft-versus-host disease on slide 24. We highlight there a number of ongoing programs where we have the goal of developing new transformative therapeutic options to build upon the significant impact JAKAFI has had on patients. For our BET inhibitor, dose escalation is ongoing both as monotherapy and in combination with RUXOLITINIB and we have reported reductions in spleen length and volume, as well as improvements in both symptoms and hemoglobin, suggesting this is an active compound. We plan to advance this program into Phase III development and expect to provide an update later this year.\n\nFor ZILUGISERTIB, our ALK2 inhibitor, we have observed early signals of clinical activity in patients with myelofibrosis through hepcidin reduction in monotherapy and in combination with RUXOLITINIB. ZILUGISERTIB was well-tolerated, with a favorable safety profile and continues to dose escalation. We plan to provide an update later this year.\n\nAs previously disclosed, we submitted a BLA for AXATILIMAB for the treatment of third-line chronic graft-versus-host disease late last year, based on a positive randomized Phase II study. In February, the filing was accepted for priority review and we anticipate an FDA decision in late August. We are excited by the possibility of bringing a new treatment option to patients with this devastating complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additionally, we anticipate initiating a Phase III trial in combination with steroids and a Phase II study in combination with RUXOLITINIB later this year.\n\nMoving on to JAKAFI, which is the foundational therapy for MF and PV, we are concentrated on improving outcomes in the near term by combining JAKAFI with other therapies, as well as through approaches that have disease-modifying potential and that can significantly expand the addressable patient population to more than 200,000 patients. Our novel, first-in-class, anti-mutant CALR-targeted monoclonal antibody has the potential to eradicate the malignant clone in patients with mutant CALR-positive MPNs and to significantly modify disease outcomes.\n\n9A9 binds with high affinity to mutant CALR and inhibits oncogenesis in cells, expressing this oncoprotein and antagonizes CALR oncogenic function--resulting in selective inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling only in CALR-mutated cell, with no effect on normal cells. This selectivity results in the specific killing of tumor cells harboring the mutation and is suggestive of the potential to alter the cause of the disease in patients with CALR-mutant MS and essential thrombocythemia. Mutant CALR-mutations are present in approximately 25% to 35% of patients with MF and ET.\n\nThe Phase I studies are currently enrolling and we are on track to share data in 2025. As a reminder, the JAK2V617F mutation is the most common somatic mutation in MPNs and is present in 55%, 60% and 95% of patients with MF, ET and PV, respectively. Unlike RUXOLITINIB--which inhibits both wild-type and V617F mutation-positive cells--O58 selectively binds to the JAK2 JH2 site, disrupting the V617F-induced confirmation and thus, allowing selective inhibition of mutant activity in the JAK2 receptor while sparing wild-type, making our JAK2V617F inhibitor a potentially transformative therapy for patients with PV, MF and ET. Data for this program is expected in 2025.\n\nMoving to oncology pipeline in slide 29. We continue to build a robust portfolio with increased emphasis on first-in-class and our best-in-class and novel immuno-oncology programs, with the potential for a large treatment effect. TAFASITAMAB--currently approved in combination with LENALIDOMIDE for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL--is on track to deliver Phase III results in follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma later this year, with a potential approval in 2025; while Phase III data for first-line DLBCL in combination with R2CHOP is expected next year.\n\nToday, we unveil positive top-line results from two pivotal Phase III RETIFANLIMAB programs. RETIFANLIMAB met the primary endpoints in both the squamous cell anal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer Phase III studies. In non-small cell lung cancer, we saw a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and squamous cell anal carcinoma, we observe a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival.\n\nBoth studies showed RETIFANLIMAB was generally well-tolerated and no new safety signals were detected. RETIFANLIMAB could represent the first-ever PD-1--or PD-L1 antibody approved for the first-line treatment of patients with SCAC. We believe that RETIFANLIMAB also has substantial strategic value as a combination therapy with the other programs in our pipeline and we look forward to sharing the full results of this study at an upcoming medical meeting later this year. Additionally, we plan on meeting with regulatory agencies to determine next steps and look forward to providing additional clarity in the coming weeks and months.\n\nA potentially first-in-class small-molecule CDK2 inhibitor has shown evidence of clinical activity, demonstrating partial responses of stable disease in patients with CCNE1 overexpressing tumors. We expect to share this data as well as the development plan at ESMO in September. We believe our CDK2 inhibitor could be a foundational therapy for patients with ovarian cancer, as well as other CCNE1 overexpressing tumor types.\n\nKRAS mutations are one of the most common genetic abnormalities in cancer, especially lung, colon and pancreatic cancers. A potentially first-in-class, best-in-class KRASG12D small molecule inhibitor, 734, is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable KRASG12D inhibitor that has shown excellent efficacy in several preclinical models. With no currently approved G12D-targeting agents, 734 could address an important patient need as the KRASG12D mutation is found in 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15% of colorectal cancer and 5% of non-small cell lung cancers. Our Phase I clinical trial is enrolling well and we are on track to share initial data in 2025.\n\nThe TGF-beta signaling pathway plays a complex role in cancer biology and progression with different functions in early and late-stage cancer cells. Early generation therapies have been unsuccessful, due in large part to the toxicity associated with systemic plasma inhibition. With our bispecific antibody inhibiting PD-1 and TGF-beta receptor 2 signaling in T cells. We have precisely tuned the binding arms against PD-1 and TGF-beta receptor 2, which we believe will result in the complete inhibition of TGF-beta signaling without the unwanted on-target effect.\n\nA TGF-beta receptor 2xPD-1 bispecific antibody has the potential to target multiple immunosuppressive pathways across a number of cancers. And if successful, could represent a meaningful contributor to our growth. We expect to share data from the Phase I program in 2025.\n\nIn closing, this slide summarizes the considerable number of milestones across 2024 and 2025 that will continue the transformation of our pipeline, with a strong focus on new molecular entities with the potential to make an indelible impact on patients.\n\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you, Pablo and good morning, everyone.\n\nOur second quarter results reflect a strong commercial execution and continued growth with total revenues of $1.04 billion, up 9% versus the same period last year. Total product revenues of $907 million in Q2 were driven by demand growth for JAKAFI and OPZELURA and increased revenue contribution from MONJUVI following our acquisition in February of the global exclusive rights to TAFASITAMAB. Total royalty revenues were $137 million, up 8% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by an acceleration in the demand for JAKAFI.\n\nTurning to JAKAFI on slide 38. JAKAFI net product revenues were $706 million for the second quarter. Net product revenues reflect continued demand growth, with paid demand up 9% year-over-year, driven by growth in PV, GVHD and MF. Year-over-year net sales growth was lower than the underlying demand growth due to higher channel inventory levels at the end of Q2 last year. At the end of Q2 2024, channel inventory was within normal range.\n\nTurning now to OPZELURA on slide 39. Net product revenues for the second quarter were $122 million, representing a 52% increase year-over-year, driven by growth in new patient starts and refills across both AD and vitiligo in the U.S., as well as continuous contributions from the commercialization of OPZELURA for vitiligo in Europe. In the second quarter, Europe contributed $11 million of OPZELURA net product revenues, driven by continued uptake in Germany and France. We expect contribution from Spain and Italy to start in the Q3, with a modest contribution in that quarter due to the impact of summer vacation in Europe.\n\nMoving on to slide 14 and our operating expenses on a graph basis. Total R&D expenses were $1.14 billion for the second quarter, reflecting the upfront consideration paid for the acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals. Excluding the impact of the up-front consideration related to Escient and other up-front and milestone payments, total R&D expenses were $692 million--representing a 13% increase year-over-year due to continued investment in our late-stage development assets, the assumption of MorphoSys' share of TAFASITAMAB development cost and the timing of certain expenses.\n\nTotal SG&A expenses were $306 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% year-over-year increase, primarily driven by $22 million of expense related to accelerated vesting for certain Escient stock awards and severance payments in connection with the acquisition of the company. Excluding the impact of the upfront consideration related to the acquisition of Escient, SG&A expenses were flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of upfront consideration and milestone payments in Q2 and in the first half of the year, total OpEx grew 8% and 5%, respectively--which is below the 9% growth in total revenues. indicating continued improvement in operating margin. Turning to slide 41.\n\nAs previously discussed, in May, we completed the acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals for a total consideration of $783 million, including Escient's net cash on the balance sheet at close. The allocation of the total consideration resulted in a one-time expense of $691 million recorded under R&D expense and $20 million recorded under SG&A expense. The remaining balance was allocated to certain assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nDuring June, we completed a $2 billion share purchase program, reflecting our confidence in the future outlook of the business, the strengths of our commercial product portfolio and the clinical development pipeline. In total, we repurchased and cancelled approximately 33.3 million shares of our common stock--representing 14.8% of our total outstanding shares of common stock--for $60 per share. The share repurchase resulted in a reduction in our cash balance and corresponding decrease to shareholders equity.\n\nMoving on to our guidance for 2024. As a result of JAKAFI's continued strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising the low end of our JAKAFI guidance from $2.69 billion to $2.71 billion. For OPZELURA, we expect continuous growth in the second half of the year, with the typical dermatology product seasonality reflected in Q3 demand in net product sales as a result of a lower number of patient visits during the summer vacation months.\n\nMoving to R&D guidance. As a result of the acquisition of Escient, we are updating our guidance for R&D expense, excluding the impact of the upfront consideration paid, to a new range of $1.76 to $1.80 billion. While a strategic review of our clinical portfolio and decision to discontinue select programs does not have an impact on R&D expenses in 2024, it creates room to aggressively pursue and invest in the development of our priority assets and, at the same time, control the future growth of R&D expenses. Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2024 guidance for other hematology/oncology products, COGs and SG&A.\n\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call's Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now be conducting a question and answer session. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue. If you would like to be placed in the question queue, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue.\n\nOur first question today is coming from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nYes, thank you for the question. This is Pablo. The RETIFANLIMAB data did not have an impact on the pipeline restructuring. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the restructuring was driven primarily by two things. One, data review of existing programs--the programs that we terminated, PD-L1, TIM-3, LAG-3, and the bispecific LAG-3, as well as the continued progression and promising data that we're seeing from the early-stage pipeline that is now becoming mid-stage and will start delivering important milestones in the next 18 months.\n\nSo, it was unrelated to the RETIFANLIMAB pivotal Phase results. We are excited about those results, particularly anal cancer data that we think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, could potentially represent the first PD-1 antibody, previously untreated squamous cell anal cancer.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now live.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nHi, Paul. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. So as Hervé said, in fact, we're growing. Total patients for MF quarter-over-quarter, year over year were up 2%. And in fact, new patients in the quarter for MF were up more than that. In fact, we continue to see growth for MF but PV and GVHD are really the main growth drivers. If you're asking about competition, in fact, we think those drugs PACRITINIB and MOMELOTINIB are being used in the second-line setting for the most part.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nCertainly. So, we look forward to updating you on the progress of our CDK2 program at ESMO in a couple of months. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our focus initially is ovarian cancer. That doesn't mean we're not doing work in other tumor types, other CCNE1 overexpressing tumor types but the focus of this initial update will be ovarian cancer.\n\nAnd what we expect to show during the ESMO presentation is a data set that captures the dose escalation, we just had a range of doses with a CDK2 inhibitor and different schedules as well. And we'll provide data that we believe supports the case to continue development of CDK2 inhibitors in patients with ovarian cancer and we'll provide--as well as the data update--a development path for this product, for this molecule, in patients with ovarian cancer going forward. So, it will be data updates, we have a range of doses, different schedules and the data support for the development and we'll show you a development plan as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Vikram Purohit from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYeah, hi. Steven, taking your question. So, in terms of its mechanism of action--it inhibits hepcidin, which then helps in terms of iron release and hemoglobin production. You know, we've shown in prior data sets that as we increase dose, we get increasing hepcidin inhibition with some variation in the hemoglobin response, which is why we've continued to dose escalate because we've had more room to do so. You know, in terms of treating myelofibrosis, there is both disease-related anemia as well as potentially drug-induced anemia from suppression of cytokines, like erythropoietin.\n\nSo, the idea is to try and attend to both of those and improve patients getting anemia, either from the disease or from the drug and we'll continue to escalate. And we'll show more patients with more data at higher doses and then, potentially, look at are there development paths there that will be potentially addressable by the compound in those settings by alleviating anemia from the disease and the drug. So, it's just that it's an updated data set in higher doses.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from David Lebowitz from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nHi, thanks for your questions. It's Barry. So PV, we believe, actually is growing because of the efficacy of the product on the disease. And in fact, the most recent data from MAJIC-PV showed that the long-term efficacy for JAKAFI for those patients is quite good and we believe that that has spurred the uptake of PV and of JAKAFI in PV patients.\n\nObviously, the IRA and the elimination of catastrophic--what patients have to pay in the catastrophic coverage area--helps all patients who are on particularly, oral chemotherapy drugs. So, we're excited about that. We're glad that that's finally happened and next year, 2025, will even be better when out-of-pocket for patients on Medicare Part D will only be $2,000. So, the growth really is coming from the efficacy of the product and we're glad that change has happened to Medicare Part D to make all oncology drugs more affordable for patients.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Eric Schmidt from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\n\nEric Schmidt\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nThanks for taking my question. It's on R&D spend and the portfolio prioritization. I guess on the one hand, you know, you've cut some programs and on the other hand, you're ticking up your R&D guidance for 2024. I presume that's in part because of the Escient acquisition. But when you think kind of big picture and strategically around how much a company like Incyte should be investing in R&D, I do think you're still the industry high in terms of R&D as percent of sales. What is your sort of solution to what a proper investment is in R&D at this stage?\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nEric, thank you for--Hervé here. Thank you for the question because it's obviously something that has been sort of driving a lot of our thinking in the past few months. I mean, our first approach to R&D spending is a project-specific financial rationale. So, if you take any of these projects that Pablo went through--and there are 12 [inaudible] there--you can look at, does it make sense to develop this? Is that an investment that is reasonable for a product of this type? And you can--you can go through the list from 12D to TGF-beta to, obviously, 617F and CALR and each of the projects is first submitted to that test, saying, 'does it make sense, independently from the rest of the portfolio, to develop this product?'.\n\nAnd obviously, we came to that conclusion for the projects that are moving forward and either because of certain data or because of the competitive situation, we came to the opposite conclusion for some of the projects that we listed today. So, that's the first thing. And then, the second one is, is that something that Incyte can do by ourselves or should we look for other sources of financing for this project or partnering, if we believe that it's something that we cannot do by ourselves? And that's why we came up with this list of projects where, by stopping some of them, we are creating room for the new projects.\n\nWe are also seeing some of the historical projects coming to an end, like RETIFANLIMAB and like, we will see a decrease of the investment in TAFASITAMAB over the next few months, as we are finishing the follicular study and next year will be the end of the first-line study. So, there is a movement where some projects are decreasing and some projects are being stopped. And all of that is creating room to, as was described by Christiana, basically maintain a reasonable R&D spend with improving ratios.\n\nAnd what Christiana just said is, as you see the evolution of the P&L, we have been consistently improving the ratios with the decreasing percentage of revenue in R&D and in SG&A. So, that's the big picture. It's going to happen at a pace that is over the next few years, it's not like one-time events where suddenly there is a big change in the number but a lot of the spirit of what was described today is prioritize resources to high potential programs in the pipeline. And I hope you could see from Pablo's discussion that there are a number of them and at the same time, you know, stop programs where we are not in a good competitive position or the data is not confirming what we were expecting at the beginning of the program.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nYes, thank you for the question. The most important point, I think, for the LAG-3 programs--both the monoclonal antibody and the bispecific--was the competitive landscape, quite honestly. You know, we are behind--in both cases--far behind our competitors. There's a LAG-3, obviously, approved in combination with PD-1 and there's at least one bispecific LAG-3 that is well ahead of us, already in randomized trials. So, that was the main determinant. When it comes to data, we'll decide what is the right time and setting is to disclose some of the data that we've seen with those programs.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Jessica Fye from J.P. Morgan Chase. Your line is now live.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nI think we are excited about that program, particularly the continuous need for better provider control in patients with PBC and PSC. Particularly PSC, there's really no good alternatives out there that have been approved. So, the benchmark from Mirum is a reasonable place to start. One of the things we like about both X2 and X4, by the way--about 262 and 547--is the great safety profile we've seen so far. So, stay tuned--we'll provide an update early next year.\n\nWhen it comes to the second part of your question, if you look at slide 14--and it's hard to pick favorites from that slide--I think that I am very excited about some of the programs that are in the pipeline. I think that if you go vertical by vertical, I think obviously the acquisition of Escient with both the X2 and the X4 antagonists--those are potential both first-in-class programs that address a number of potential indications. I think in oncology, the near-term CDK2 data reveal is something that we're very excited about.\n\nAnd I think that when you look at our TGF-beta receptor x PD-1 bispecific, we have taken a unique approach to those two pathways that we think could be a big differentiator. And MPNs, of course, I have to mention--I'm using CALR and 617F programs, both of which are not just first-in-class but they're a unique way to address patients with MPNs and potentially change disease outcomes by changing the natural history of the disease. So, I think those are the areas where I would say, today, we have the most excitement inside the company. And I would add, by investigators outside the company that is showing by how quickly some of the studies are occurring.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYes, Jay. It's Steven. Thanks for the question. There were two simultaneous publications that were intriguing, showing that potentially, JAK inhibition can modulate the T cell environment in a positive way and enhance checkpoint inhibition. However, our own experience in the past has not been as successful clinically. So, I don't know if you remember but years ago, we tried JAK inhibition on its own in several solid tumors based on an inflammatory hypothesis with C-reactive protein and unfortunately, those endeavors were negative.\n\nWe also did some work in investigating initiated work in combination with PD-1 and JAK inhibitors. Although we didn't have clinical data, some of the translational data didn't show the right directional changes in T cells. But, you know, you are correct in that those two simultaneous papers re-ignited some interest and we'll re-look at it but there are no current R&D sponsored plans there.\n\nJay Olson\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nHi, Evan. It's Christiana. So, first of all, the share repurchase that we did reflect the confidence that we have in the outlook of the business, both driven by this progress on the commercial front but also very much so by the evolving pipeline and all the excitement behind the programs that Pablo discussed. So, we saw a very big disconnect between the long-term value that we see in the company versus what has been reflected in the stock price. Thus, the decision to do the share repurchase.\n\nThe size of the share repurchase was enabled by the fact that we have a very strong balance sheet and we were in a position to both do a big share purchase and, at the same time, retain financial flexibility for more BD if we chose to do so. As you saw today, we have a very exciting pipeline so, there is a lot of focus on moving forward our internal programs but we are in a position to opportunistically bring in additional opportunities if we believe these are opportunities where we can add value.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Marc Frahm from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nMatteo Trotta\n\nHi, Alex. Matteo here. Yes. So, the preferred positions that we gained this year in CBS was one of the key contributors to the OPZELURA growth that we're experiencing this year. In addition to that, obviously, we're seeing patients on CBS benefit from an easier and improved accessibility to OPZELURA. And it gives us the insight, the opportunity to better execute the support programs that we have in place for all the commercial eligible patients.\n\nIn terms of expecting for the future, we have a plan for 2025, which we are executing while we speak. We'll continue to bring up some new data that we have. Very interesting from a PBM and payer perspective, the real-world evidence of OPZELURA. And we expect that we continue to improve our access going forward and utilization management, wherever it's feasible and possible. With always keeping in mind that every step we take in that direction will have to be improving our net sales line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Reni Benjamin from Citizens JMP. Your line is now live.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nI think I will--maybe I can start and Barry can speak in more detail. I mean, the picture on TAFASITAMAB, obviously, was--the financial picture of TAFASITAMAB was changed when we basically got for free the full rights of the product. I mean, that was the transaction at the beginning of the year. Where it puts us now is facing the two Phase III studies that we have ongoing. We will have very soon, in the next few weeks, the result of the follicular lymphoma--assuming, if it's positive, it would obviously give us an opportunity. It's not enormous in size, it's very competitive but there is a lot of upside for the brand.\n\nAt the stage where we are on this new indication, it would be a large randomized study so, it will add to the clinical profile of the product across all indications. So, that's the first step. And then, there is a first-line coming in 2025, where if positive and depending on the size of the benefits that is observed, could have a larger potential for the brand. I think the positioning of MONJUVI and MINJUVI in Europe and the U.S. is really driven by the fact that the efficacy that you see is at a very low cost, in term of safety and side effects.\n\nSo, that was the ratio of efficacy and safety that we observed with--MONJUVI is very unique compared to the rest of the competition. And it has space that I think will, depending on the data that we see, will be important. It's not going to be a brand that is in the multi-billion range but it's going to be a brand that can increase by a few hundred millions and I think it will be a good contribution to the portfolio.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nYeah. I mean, Hervé really said it all but, you know, we are excited about follicular and marginal zone. There's combined--there's about 12,500 patients that are treated in those settings, in the second-line plus setting so, yes, it's competitive but particularly for follicular lymphoma, R2 is currently the market leader in the second-line setting in follicular lymphoma and obviously, adding TAFA to it, we hope to improve the outcome for patients and in the first-line setting for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma when we have that data next year.\n\nAnd hopefully, the addition of TAFA to R-CHOP will actually improve the lives of patients. In fact, you know, we're hoping to, obviously, improve cure rates and there's 30,000 patients in our frontline diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. And then, our study is really concentrating on IPIs three and higher. So anyway, so the opportunity for us is there, as long as the data is what we hope it to be. I think we'll have success, as Hervé said but in both situations--diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in indolent lymphoma--it's a very competitive market but we think we have a profile of a drug that physicians and patients will want to use.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Kelly Shi from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nHi, Clare. It's Christiana. Let me take the first part of the question regarding OPZELURA and gross-to-net. So, gross-to-net in Q2 was broadly in line with where we were last Q2 so, the growth really was driven by demand here. In terms of going forward, as we have discussed in the past, we are not focusing on gross-to-net in isolation but on net sales and there is where the focus is. If there are situations where we believe that there is an opportunity to improve positioning, to improve access by giving some additional discount and that would lead to a disproportionate increase in demand and, therefore, net sales--we are going to pursue it. But looking at gross-to-net in isolation is not something that we will be doing and providing separate forward guidance for GTN--gross-to-net.\n\nMatteo Trotta\n\nYes. And I can take the other two pieces, Matteo here. One is the split between atopic dermatitis and non-segmental vitiligo, which is currently 60-40. And it's a great indication for us because when we see the split being consistent, the growth is coming from both indications. And then, the third piece of your question, I believe was on the sizing--the potential of the pediatric indication. We see definitely that one, the potential label expansion of OPZELURA for patients 12 to 11 years old with atopic dermatitis, a driver of continuous growth.\n\nThe patient population is quite sizable. We see 2 million patients with AD in the age range and mostly treated with TCIs and TCFs today. So, great opportunity for us. And in terms of sizing, we see the contribution to our total AD business in the future from pediatric indications in the range of 10%, 15% of their business, which is fairly in line with what we see from other therapies in the same space for the same age range.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Berens from SVB Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nHey, Andrew. It's Steven, thanks for your question. On JAKAFI XR, as Pablo had in his slides, he pointed to the pivotal BE data--the bioequivalence data--coming in the early part of 2025 next year. And then, as the stability delivers towards the sort of third quarter, that's when we would file that indication--should everything be directionally correct. And then, get an approval in 2026. So, that's within what we said we would deliver for XR and we await that pivotal BE data for which the study's starting very soon.\n\nFor CALR and G617F, again, to expand on Pablo's comments, it's still early days for both programs, obviously, in dose escalation with enormous promise--in terms of a totally new mindset around disease modification-potentially cure because of eradication of the malignant clone. And in those entities, I mean, it's still early days; we'd have to discuss with regulators, is there is a completely another way of viewing the diseases and not look at the traditional JAK inhibition pathway for SVR35 and total symptom score in terms of eradicating the clone and removing the malignancy and the associated morbidity from it. There are potentially other regulatory pathways which we'll explore at that time. So, thank you for bringing that up because it could be a completely new way of thinking about those entities.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. Next question is coming from Gavin Clark-Gartner from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nYes, thank you for the question. So look, as Hervé mentioned, when we acquired full rights for TAFASITAMAB early this year and knowing that we have a near-term pivotal readout as well as another one next year, that led us to rethink a little bit about whether the level of investment in that program is adequate. And quite honestly, we're in the middle of that process.",
    "content2": "We're obviously aware of all the data with CD19-targeted therapies in autoimmune disease. We're conducting a full evaluation as well as interactions with external scientists to really understand, A, what's the opportunity for TAFA at this point in AI from the mechanistic point of view; what's the competitive landscape, what does it look like and what are the remaining opportunities that we can go after with a reasonable and prudent level of investment. So, we're doing that evaluation literally as we speak. We'll have an update, probably, on that later this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Salveen. Maybe I'll take that. I mean, it's obviously the whole purpose of our investment in R&D is to more than compensate for what could be the expiration of the current product. So, you can look at the size--I mean, the guidance we have on JAKAFI that has been there for a number of years is around $3 billion by--at peak sales. So, we are way--very much on the way to get there.\n\nAnd when you look at the number of projects, we are speaking of 10 launches in the next few years, we are speaking of 12 NCEs that we have in development--I mean, that would be, each of them with a potential that is meaningful, that would be certainly way more than what we need to just compensate for JAKAFI. So, the view--and obviously, it will depend on the clinical success we have with this project--but the view is that today our portfolio is very much giving us a growth profile that goes beyond JAKAFI's patent expiration.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over for any further closing comments.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you all for participating in the call today. Any questions, the IR team will be available for the rest of the day. Thank you and goodbye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."

You may be placed into the question queue at any time by pressing Star 1 on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ben Strain, Associate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ben.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before I begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables, and slides that follow today's call. On today's call, I'm joined by Hervé, Pablo, Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks. Barry, Steven, and Matteo will also be available for Q&A. I would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. I will now hand the call over to Hervé.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Ben and good morning everyone. Before I get into the quarterly results, I'm pleased to share that Matteo Trotta has recently joined Incyte as General Manager of our U.S. Dermatology Business Unit reporting to me. Matteo comes to us from Novartis where he was responsible for the immunology business in the U.S. and he will be leading the US dermatology team at Incyte to continue to grow OPZELURA, prepared for the launches of povorcitinib and other promising IAI pipeline products in the coming years. Now turning to our Q1 results. Total revenue grew 9% in Q1 versus last year. And I will discuss in the next slide the details of the underlying demand growth for Jakafi and OPZELURA to clarify the performance of both brands in Q1. Starting with JAKAFI on Slide 6. In the first quarter, JAKAFI net product revenue of $572 million does not fully reflect the demand growth as total patients increased 5% in the first quarter versus the same quarter last year, with growth driven by PV and GVHD. Sequential growth versus Q4 was also strong in all indications, as you see on the graph on the right.\n\nJAKAFI channel inventory reduction in the first quarter had a negative impact on net revenues of approximately $55 million. Based on the strong patient demand since this quarter and anticipated growth for the balance of the year, we are reiterating our full year 2024 JAKAFI net revenue guidance of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion. Turning to Slide 7 and looking at JAKAFI, total paid demand by indication during the first quarter of '22, '23 and 2024. As you can see, total paid demand growth in the top left corner continues to be strong. MF in the top right is consistent year-after-year, and the largest growth is coming from PV and GVHD. Additionally, JAKAFI continues to maintain its leadership and market share in myelofibrosis. Based on market research, total patient market share and discontinuation rate have remained stable in the first-line setting over the past several months with virtually no impact from competitors, which has been consistent with our expectations.\n\nMoving to OPZELURA. Total OPZELURA net product revenues in the first quarter were $86 million, up 52% when compared to the same quarter last year. The weekly prescription trend, as shown on the right of Slide 8, reflects continued growth of OPZELURA in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo, with typical Q1 seasonality. U.S. total prescriptions for Opzelura grew 41% year-over-year, outpacing the total AD market, which grew 23%. The AD market, including OPZELURA, was impacted by the Change Healthcare Cyber Attack, particularly in March. Importantly, we are beginning to see in April a rebound in filled prescription to level seen before the cyber-attack. From an access perspective, we have seen early encouraging results since OPZELURA moved in January to preferred position in the CVS network, as TRX growth within the CVS network outpaced growth seen in other plants.\n\nMoving to Slide 9, as discussed in the past, we are on track to provide 10 high-impact launches by 2030. Importantly, many of the programs highlighted on this slide are de-risked as they are post-proof-of-concept, including Axatilimab, which has been submitted to the FDA for approval, Ruxolitinib Cream in Pediatric AD to be submitted to the FDA in Q3, and povorcitinib where we are in Phase III in HS and Vitiligo and initiating a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis later this year. Moving to slide 10, In addition to our internal efforts to deliver multiple launches by 2030, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Escient Pharmaceuticals for $750 million with cash on hand. This acquisition further strengthens our pipeline with two novel first-in-class medicines, EP262 and EP547, which have the potential to treat a broad range of inflammatory disorders. I will now turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hervé. And good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we continue to make solid progress across our pipeline, which is focused on three areas, MPNs and graft-versus-host disease, oncology, and inflammatory diseases. In MPNs and graft-versus-host disease, we initiated a Phase I study earlier this quarter with a JAK2V617F inhibitor. As a reminder, the JAK2V617F mutation is the most common somatic mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms and is present in 55%, 60%, and 95% of patients with MF, ET, and PV, respectively. Unlike RUXOLITINIB, which inhibits both wild-type and V617F mutation-positive cells, 058 selectively binds to the JAK2 JH2 site, disrupting the V617F-induced confirmation, and thus, allowing selective inhibition of mutant activity in the JAK2 receptor while sparing wild-type. Together with our anti-mutant CALR program, these two potentially disease-modifying programs represent a fundamentally new approach to addressing MF, ET, and PV and could help to solidify our leadership in MPNs.\n\nAs previously disclosed, we submitted the BLA for AXATILIMAB for the treatment in third-line chronic graft-versus-host disease late last year. In February, the filing was accepted for prior review, and we anticipate a decision by the FDA in the second half of 2024. We are excited by the possibility of bringing a new treatment options to patients with this devastating complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In oncology, we continue to build out a robust pipeline with the potential to deliver meaningful innovation for patients. This quarter, we initiated a Phase I study with our KRASG12D inhibitor, INCB161734. INCB161734 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable KRASG12D inhibitor. And as highlighted at AACR earlier this month, it has shown excellent efficacy in several preclinical models. With no currently approved G12D targeting agents, 734 could address an important patient need as a KRASG12D mutation is found in 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15% of colorectal cancers, and 5% of non-small cell lung cancers. In dermatology, we continue to maximize the potential of RUXOLITINIB Cream and POVORCITINIB and believe the acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals, will substantially expand our II pipeline by adding 2 first-in-class medicines with the potential to address a number of medical needs.\n\nThe key driver of our interest in Escient is our MRGPRX2 program. MRGPRX2 is a specific novel mechanism for blocking mast cell activation independent from IgE, and has been a high priority target to add to our IAI pipeline. EP262 is a first-in-class medicine, which entered the clinic in January of 2023, and has been evaluated in Phase II studies. In the Phase I healthy volunteer study, EP262 was well-tolerated, had low interpatient PK variability, and achieved exposures well above predicted efficacious levels. EP262 is currently in a Phase I-B open-label study in CIndU, and in two randomized Phase II studies in CSU and atopic dermatitis with data for all three studies expected by early 2025. EP547 is a potent and highly selective antagonist of MRGPRX4. MRGPRX4 is expressed on neurons in the dorsal root ganglia and specifically activated by bile acids that are increased in cholestatic patients.\n\nInitial evaluation is being conducted in cholestatic pruritus with clinical proof-of-concept for cholestatic pruritus associated with PBC and PSC anticipated by early 2025. A number of exciting readouts are expected by early 2025 with the potential first launch in CSU by 2029. At AAD earlier this quarter, we presented additional data from the randomized Phase II study of RUXOLITINIB Cream in patients with mild-to-moderate Hidradenitis Suppurativa, reinforcing the potential RUXOLITINIB Cream in the syndication. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in abscess and inflammatory nodule count compared to control at week 16, and further reinforces the efficacy and safety profile of RUXOLITINIB Cream. We are currently engaging with the FDA to obtain agreement on a potential Phase III design. We also presented positive data at AAD from the randomized Phase II study evaluating POVORCITINIB in patients with prurigo nodularis and are on track to initiate a Phase III study in the coming months.\n\nAs highlighted on Slide 21, the study made its primary endpoint of a four-greater-point improvement in the itch Numerical Rating Scale score, which was achieved by significantly more patients who received POVORCITINIB across all dosing groups at week 16 versus placebo. We believe that with RUXOLITINIB Cream and POVORCITINIB, we will be the only company with the ability to potentially provide both a topical and oral option for a number of indications including prurigo nodularis, Hidradenitis Suppurativa, and vitiligo. We continue to make important progress in the first quarter by achieving several clinical and regulatory milestones. Within our oncology pipeline, we believe that our potentially best-in-class CDK2 inhibitor is an active agent, and we look forward to sharing data as well as our development plan later this year. In addition, the pivotal trial of tafasitamab in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma, also known as inMIND, we'll read out later this year, and we look forward to sharing those results.\n\nWith the BLA for AXATILIMAB submitted late last year, we look forward to working with the FDA to make AXATILIMAB available to patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease later this year and to initiate additional combination studies in patients with less pretreated chronic graft-versus-host. Within our dermatology portfolio, we expect to submit the sNDA for OPZELURA for pediatric atopic dermatitis and expect multiple data readouts throughout the year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you, Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued strong growth with total revenues of $881 million, up 9% versus the same period last year. Total product revenues of $730 million in Q1 were driven by demand growth for JAKAFI and OPZELURA and increased revenue contribution from MONJUVI following the acquisition in February of the global exclusive rights to tafasitamab. The product demand growth was partially offset by an anticipated reduction in channel inventory for JAKAFI and the typical Q1 dynamics for JAKAFI and OPZELURA. Total royalty revenues, which are primarily comprised of royalties from Novartis for JAKAFI and TABRECTA, royalties from Lilly for OLUMIANT were $126 million, up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2023, driven by strong demand for JAKAFI.\n\nTotal revenues included $25 million upfront payment received under our collaboration and license agreement with CMS, for the development and commercialization of POVORCITINIB in China and select other Asian countries. Turning to JAKAFI on Slide 26. JAKAFI net product revenues were $572 million for the first quarter. Net product revenues reflect continued demand growth with total patients up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth in PV and GVHD and continued stable demand in MF. As a result, we experienced the highest quarter paid demand for JAKAFI since launch. As expected in Q1, we saw patients that were on free drug in the fourth quarter of 2023 returned to paid demand and a related decrease in channel inventory levels. As you may recall, channel inventory levels increased by $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of this year, we saw a drawdown in channel inventory, which had $55 million negative impact on net sales versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWhile we expect channel inventory to remain around the levels we ended in Q1, buying decisions of our customers can't always be predicted. In addition, net sales in the first quarter were impacted by the typical Q1 higher gross net deductions as a result of both contributions to close the Medicare gap and commercial copay assistance. Turning now to OPZELURA on Slide 27. Net product revenues for the first quarter were $86 million, representing a 52% increase year-over-year, driven by growth in net new patient starts and refills across both AD and vitiligo, as well as early contribution from the commercialization of OPZELURA for vitiligo in Germany, Austria and France. As expected, OPZELURA net product revenues in the first quarter reflected the typical Q1 seasonality and the reset of deductibles and copays at the beginning of the year. Beyond the typical Q1 dynamics OPZELURA product revenues were impacted by the cyber-attack on UnitedHealth Change Healthcare unit.\n\nMoving on to Slide 28 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Total R&D expenses were $429 million for the first quarter, representing a 6% year-over-year increase, which was primarily as a result of the progression of our pipeline. Total SG&A expenses were $300 million for the first quarter, representing a 5% year-over-year decrease, driven by the timing of direct-to-consumer marketing activities and certain other expenses. Now turning to the acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire Escient for $750 million in an all-cash transaction. We believe Escient’s two lead programs offer a multibillion-dollar potential commercial opportunity across multiple indications and have the potential to contribute to our revenue by 2029. In addition, we expect to be able to realize synergies by leveraging our current development and commercial capabilities and infrastructure.\n\nWe anticipate the acquisition to become effective by the third quarter of 2024, and add approximately $5 million per month in incremental R&D expense. Depending on the timing of the close, we expect the acquisition to add $20 million to $30 million to the full year 2024 R&D expenses. Finally, following this acquisition, we'll continue to have a strong balance sheet, which will allows us to consider additional opportunities. As of the end of the first quarter, we have $3.9 billion in cash and no debt. Moving to our guidance for 2024. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Escient, we are reiterating our full year 2024 guidance for JAKAFI, our other hematology/oncology products, COGS, R&D and SG&A. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to be placed in the question queue, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. To remove your question from the queue, you may press Star 2. Once again, that's Star 1 to be placed in the question queue. One moment, please, while we poll for questions.  Our first question is coming from Kelly Shi from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\n\nKelly Shi\n\nEquity Associate, Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nThank you for taking my questions. So, for OPZELURA, could you give us some more color on the go-to net for the rest of the year? And what is the latest review and do you see in both AD and vitiligo? Thank you. And I also have a follow-up.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nHi, Kelly, it's Christiana. Let me take the first part of the question, and then I will turn it to Matteo to comment on the second part. So, in terms of the gross to net in the first quarter, it was at the same level as last year Q1, so at around 60%. Going forward, as we have previously discussed, we will not be making forward-looking comments on gross to net. Our focus is on maximizing the potential of OPZELURA, and by this, I mean the maximizing net sales versus looking at gross to net in isolation.\n\nMatteo Trotta\n\nAnd on the split of business between the two indications, when we look at the IQVIA data, triangulated with external and internal sources, we see a 40-60 split consistent over time, where 40% is non-segment of Vitiligo and 60% is atopic dermatitis. And we're very happy to see that both indications are growing at quite a healthy pace.\n\nKelly Shi\n\nEquity Associate, Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nThank you. And also at AAD dermatology conference, we saw the data of topical ruxo cream in both Hurley Stage 1 and the 2 HS patients. Could you share what kind of physician feedback this year? And also, how do they see the unmet needs in both cardiac Stage 1 and 2 patients for novel topical drug like OPZELURA needed to manage disease in this specific population? Thank you.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYes. Thank you for the question. It's Steven. So, the milder type of HS still represents about 100,000, 150,000 patients in the United States. It still has morbidity and unmet need, and these patients have absences and nodules that cause them discomfort and morbidity and lends itself to a topical treatment because it's not as extensive as the moderate and severe, which has fistulas, et cetera. So, we conducted this POC study and saw this data, which is extremely encouraging in the mild stage of HS in terms of abscess and nodule decreases. And as Pablo said in his prepared remarks, we are now working with regulators to get an appropriate endpoint in this entity for which no drug is approved and has this unmet need I spoke about. To the specifics of your question, the physician and KOL feedback is excellent. I mean they were surprised by the efficacy seen with a topical agent in this entity. So, we are excited about it as well.\n\nKelly Shi\n\nEquity Associate, Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.  Your next question is coming from David Lebowitz from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Neil Lebowitz\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. Could you comment on JAKAFI growth dynamics going forward given IRA and shift to the out-of-pocket expenses for patients?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure. As you saw from our guidance, $2.69 billion, $2.75 billion, we're very optimistic about the continued growth of JAKAFI. Obviously, we benefit in the IRA because as we talked about before, we have the small biotech exemption. So, beginning in 2025, for example, with the reduced out-of-pockets for patients, it really just helps the patients, of course but we don't have to contribute that 20% to catastrophic that other oral drugs will. So, we think there is a benefit in 2024 for the reduced out-of-pocket in Medicare Part D being around 3,250 for patients for the entire year and then next year, being 2,000 all patients who are taking oral oncology drugs, I believe, will benefit, but we continue to see our growth, as Hervé pointed out, coming from PV, GVHD and in myofibrosis were very stable and remain the market leader in that setting.\n\nDavid Neil Lebowitz\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nWould you be able to comment further on whether - how growth in 2025 might look vis-a-vis 2024 given these dynamics?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nNo. We obviously said we are still confident about $3 billion plus by the time we hit 2028, so that's what we are still confident in. And so, we think that '24 and '25 should be just fine.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist. Your line is now live.\n\nKripa Devarakinda\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. On JAKAFI, Hervé, you mentioned that you see very little impact on Jakafi's share from competitors. Can you talk a little bit about whether the competition has changed the average duration on JAKAFI? They do go on to JAKAFI in the frontline, but is there any - are you observing people getting off of JAKAFI sooner? And also for the BET inhibitor combination, there was a recent report of increased AML incidents in patients on the JAKAFI/BET combo for a competitor. I just wanted to get your insights into how this may or may not impact your internal BET program?  Thank you.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nSo Kripa, I'll take your first call, and then I'll hand it over to Pablo for the second part of your question. So, for JAKAFI share from competitors. There really hasn't been any impact on our duration of therapy or discontinuation rates at all, certainly in myelofibrosis. So, we are very confident. We remain the market leader. Other JAK inhibitors may be used in the second-line, third-line setting. If anything, the market size itself is growing because now patients will go on 1, 2, 3 therapies, and I'll hand it over to Pablo for the second part of your question.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nYes, thank you for the question. So, I mean, obviously, I'm not going to comment on data from other companies. Our BET inhibitor program, as we've discussed is going very well, and we'll discuss additional data over the course of the year, and we are planning a potential pivotal trial going forward, which we'll unveil later this year. Reviewing the data from our internal program, we have, at this point no concerns over the safety when it comes to AML transformation. Now you - I'm sure you know that if you follow a number of patients with MF for long enough, some of them will have transformation to AML as part of the natural history of the disease. But at this point, we have no concerns with our program.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim. Your line is now live.\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. I had a question on POVORCITINIB and again, commenting about another data set. But I just wanted to get your insight on the reasons RINVOQ head-to-head study against DUPIXENT and AV and whether or how that impacts perhaps your view on the potential of POVORCITINIB across various dermatology indications?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYes, Michael, thank you for the question. Now we have seen the data. Obviously, it is an impressive data set. At this point, as you know we have a number of studies ongoing POVORCITINIB. We have had internal discussions about the potential to extending the trials of povo to atopic dermatitis. What I can say right now is we are encouraged by the data from RINVOQ. I think that it's an indication that povo could work very well in this disease. We have not made an internal decision that yet as to whether to develop povorcitinib and atopic dermatitis yet, but it's certainly something we are contemplating.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Marc Frahm from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nMarc Frahm\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just start. One, just following up on the prior BET question. Can you - were your comments just based on the clinical data you are seeing in those - concern of AML? Or maybe can you speak to preclinically - because I believe that BET inhibitor from a competitor has shown genotoxicity in some preclinical assays. Has your's shown genotoxicity?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYes. It's Steven answering your question. So, just to reiterate Pablo's remarks and remind you that our BET program was in the clinic a while ago in solid tumors. And then we have obviously pivoted to study myeloproliferative neoplasms. We've treated close to 200 patients to-date. And in the clinical data set, which is the most powerful, as Pablo said we have no concern as regards AML transformation or any concerns that we've seen in that regard. From a prior preclinical work on things like AMs assay and genotoxicity, et cetera, we also have no issue, and we are aware of the issue with the competitor drug that was seen in preclinical work.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.  Your line is now live.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the JAKAFI dynamics. What's your explanation - or I guess what do you think is the best explanation for the sequential downtick in total JAKAFI demand? Was that something that's just seasonally related that you typically see in first quarter? And then I guess, on the competitive front, I am curious why you think you're not seeing any impact at this point to market share or patient persistence? Is this something you might expect to change going forward? Or would you expect market share and persistence to remain stable based on sort of what you're hearing in terms of market research and on the ground KOLs discussions? Thanks.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nMaybe I can start on the uptick. I mean what we said, and you can see on the slide is that, in fact, there is an increase in the number of patients treated across all three indications in Q1 versus Q4, and there is a growth that you can see on the so-called paid demand graph also that shows that versus last year there is a lot of growth in PV and GVHD. So, the unit growth of JAKAFI sequential to Q4 and versus Q1 of last year is there and fairly visible. The reason for the sequential growth versus Q4 is what we discussed when we discussed Q4 a few months ago is that there was an abnormal free drug ratio in Q4 that has been completely fixed in Q1. So, we are back to normal rates of free drug in Q1. Now on the competitive side, maybe Barry, if you want to speak of why we don't see the impact of the new competitors.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure. I think, in fact, the new competitors, let us take an [inaudible] and momelotinib as examples, there - as far as we can tell from all of our market research, from all of our experience working with hematologists, they are all being used in the second-line setting or maybe in patients that have very, very low platelets, for example. So, we anticipate because of really the overall survival benefit of JAKAFI, because of the tolerability of JAKAFI, because of the symptom release of JAKAFI, it's a great drug, and it will continue to be very useful to patients who have myelofibrosis going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Vikram Purohit from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nVikram Purohit\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. So, we had two, one on LIMBER and then one on OPZELURA. So on LIMBER, for the ALK2 POC data set we're expecting to see by the middle of the year, could you just frame for us kind of what the scope and size of the data set is going to be? And what you would define as sufficient for continued development for that program based on what we see for that POC data set? And then secondly, on OPZELURA, I just wanted to revisit the topic of potential guidance and see when you think might be a good potential time to provide revenue guidance for OPZELURA since you mentioned that it seems like the script shared seem stable between AD and vitiligo? Thanks.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nHi, Vikram, it's Steven. So, on your first question, just a reminder, ALK2's mechanism felt to work through hepcidin inhibition and then ameliorate anemia by releasing iron and make it available for hemoglobin production. As we've already shown in multiple presentations, we can decrease subsiding levels. The question you get into does this translate to some sort of clinical benefit? Just to remind you of the study, it has 3 groups, treatment group A, B and C. A was monotherapy, B was in combination with RUX, but those were in later line patients. And the real focus right now, as you can see on clintrials.gov is treatment Group C, which is the treatment-naive group of patients to see in combination with RUX, will help make an effect that will be of clinical benefit to patients, either by raising hemoglobin or preventing the decrease that sometimes occurs with JAK2 inhibition.\n\nAnd then if we're able to demonstrate that as we dose increase in the second half of this year, then we'll have a clinical proof-of-concept that we can then potentially take forward to a regulatory environment, but we'll have to be clear that we are benefiting patients from a clinical benefit point of view in that treatment-naive group, and we'll have that data set second half of this year. I'll turn it over for the second question.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nVikram, it's Christiana. I'll take the second part. As we discussed on our last call, before we provide guidance for OPZELURA, we’re looking to have more real world data on utilization, especially for vitiligo. And data that goes beyond that first initial phase of therapy, which may represent a phase of experimentation by patients. So, we are still early into the launch. We are still going through that initial phase of patients on therapy. So, we are waiting for more real-world data before we are in a position to give you guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Derek Archila from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nDerek Archila\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones from us. I guess, first, just on JAKAFI. As you noted, the JAKAFI growth coming from GBHD and PV. So I guess, what does this mean for future assumptions around myelofibrosis? I know you said stable but how should we be thinking about that for the rest of this year? And then in terms of CDK2, I guess, where do you think the bar is right now, I guess, from a PPP? And I guess what do you intend to show this year for proof-of-concept? Thanks.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nI'll take the first part of your question, it's Barry. So for JAKAFI, we continue to see myelofibrosis - the way I look at the myelofibrosis patient population, there is about 18,000 patients, prevalent patients with myelofibrosis. And because we are the market leader because of the overall survival and symptom benefit that JAKAFI provides, we will continue to think of patients as either being on JAKAFI, which is most of the myelofibrosis patients or they have been on JAKAFI or they will be on JAKAFI. When they progress on JAKAFI, then there is other options, fortunately, that are available to them. But going forward for 2024 and beyond, we continue to expect to be the market leader in first-line myelofibrosis. And I'll turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nYes. Thank you for the question. So, in our CDK2 inhibitor program, we continue to be encouraged by the data that we have seen. And regarding the part of your question about what data we're going to review later this year, we are in the final stages of optimizing the dose for the CDK2 inhibitor program. Our idea will be later this year to provide a substantial clinical data set, including the dose selection for patients. Initially, the focus will be ovarian cancer, but not necessarily only over the longer-term, as well as we are starting combination trials in ovarian cancer, and we are continuing to enroll patients with breast cancer. So, later this year, you will see the dose selection, as well as the data for ovarian cancer, as well as the development plan in ovarian cancer. When it comes to the bar for efficacy, if you look at the CDK2 inhibitor landscape today, most of our competitors have decided to focus on breast cancer or other areas.\n\nWe continue to believe that ovarian cancer is an important opportunity. Other competitors in the space like ADCs are coming into play. We are tracking those closely to figure it out what is the overlap between the different patient populations in different - with different molecular markers. But basically, in the second part of the year, later this year we'll provide clarity on dose, schedule and the development plan in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Jessica Fye from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nWas that impacted at all by the change in health care issues in the quarter? And then on Pobrecitinib, the phase 3 studies in vitiligo, I noticed on clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like there's a single primary endpoint of FFASC-75 for the phase 3 trials, whereas RINVOC, I think, has two primary endpoints of FFASC-75 and TBASC-50 So what's the rationale for only having a single primary endpoint here relative to the competition, and how do you expect that to kind of play out based on the, you know, endpoints you're studying? Thank you.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on OPZELURA, is it possible to quantify the impact of the changed healthcare issue for that product? And what about for JAKAFI, was that impacted at all by the Change Healthcare issue in the quarter? And then on POVORCITINIB, the Phase III studies in vitiligo. I noticed on clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like there is a single primary endpoint of F-VASI 75 for the Phase III trials, whereas RINVOQ, I think, has two primary endpoints of F-VASI 75 and T-VASI T50. So, what's the rationale for only having a single primary endpoint here relative to the competition? And how do you expect that to kind of play out based on the end points you are studying? Thank you.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nHi, Jessica. I'll take the Change Healthcare on OPZELURA. What we see at the end of February that there was this cyber-attack reported pretty much caused the network interruption for a few weeks. So as a result, the Change Healthcare was unable to process the claim for a few weeks. When we looked at - when we deep dive in the data, we saw a softer March when you look at the entire atopic dermatitis market  that we monitor, and that caused an estimate of $4 million to $5 million negative impact from OPZELURA in Q1. The good news for us is that we are monitoring April, and we demand - weekly demand back on track to the levels we saw pre-cyber attack and the more recently.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nAnd Jessica, just on JAKAFI, we may have actually had an impact from Change Health, but we don't know. We did have when it first happened some request from specialty pharmacies that wanted extended terms for payment. But we really can't see a big impact because most of the specialty pharmacies were able to switch over to the other system that provides the service for the specialty pharmacies.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nAnd then, just to address your question on POVORCITINIB in vitiligo, we have two identical Phase III studies ongoing STOP V1 and STOP V2 in patients 18 years or older with 5% or greater body surface area involvement of non-segmental vitiligo. It's a little tricky on the endpoints. But just to tell you, our primary end point for the FDA in the United States is actually identical. It's Facial-VASI 75, and total VASI 50. For other parts of the world, there may be a different primary endpoint. For example, in Europe, they're interested most in the total VASI 50. So, that leads to some of the confusion. But for our study for the FDA, it's both Facial-VASI 75 and total VASI 50, together measured at week 52. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nTazeen Ahmad\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nHi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. On OPZELURA, can you - and I'm sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but can you talk about refill rates for patients maybe now that have been on therapy for a few quarters? Can you talk about how you are seeing their use of tubes with the average use of tubes is? I'm just curious that if patients are having good results with the claim, whether they are taking many drug holidays in between when they don't have as much itch, for example? Thanks.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nMatteo can add to the comment. I mean the picture in terms of refill rate has been the following is that, in atopic dermatitis, we have observed a refill that is slightly north of two tubes per patient. And that is relatively stable. Now it is still increasing a little bit, but it is relatively stable. In vitiligo, it's moving very quickly, and we are not yet at the steady state. It is a situation where we see, unfortunately that there are patients who are not complying with the treatment as it was prescribed, and we’re obviously working with physicians and patients directly to improve it. And as you know, I mean from the experience we had in the clinical trial, we are estimating that if we are successful, it will be around 10 tube per patient, but we are still at the number that is lower than that today when you try to look at patients who have enough history. So, do you want to speak about what we are doing on the marketing side.\n\nMatteo Trotta\n\nYes. The only comment that I can add is on - just in this quarter, we are launching a very promising adherence program that we – we are confident will impact - continue to impact the refill rate growth that we see across both indications, AD and Vitiligo.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just give us an update on how the ex-U.S. launch of OPZELURA is progressing with the addition of France at this point? And how you are thinking about the pediatric uptake in 2025? And if I could also just ask one on business development. Post the recent acquisition, you still have significant balance sheet capacity. Could we see you do meaningful M&A in the near term on top of patient?\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nOkay. So, maybe Salveen, I'll take the first part about the European launch because, in fact there is a lot of activities going on there. As you know, we launched in Germany, Austria. So, that is the base that we have. Recently, we’re part of AXA Direct, which is a French process where you can commercialize your product while you are negotiating the price. So, what you see in the numbers today is that there are around $2 million that are recognized sales from France. And it's a sort of an estimate with a conservative price per tube that we are using to do that. But the process there is moving very well, and we anticipate by the second half of the year to be fully reimbursed and paid for at a good price in France.\n\nAnd we have now in Italy and Spain agreement on the price where we will be launching between mid-year and the second half of the year in both countries. So Germany, Italy, Spain and France will be fully operational by Q3 and will be contributing to the top-line. There is also some smaller countries in Europe where the process is ongoing, and there is always the big question mark of the United Kingdom, England, where as you know, the pricing discussion can take more time, and we are in the process there. So, it is a very positive outcome for Opzelura in Europe because we got reimbursement now in many countries and most of the large countries. And we see a very good uptake of the demand in terms of volume in the countries where it is available, specifically in France. Now the second part of your question was about the pediatric uptake in the U.S., when we get approval. So maybe, Matteo if you want to speak about that?\n\nMatteo Trotta\n\nYes, sure. Thanks for the question. And we are very excited by the potential opportunity to help 2 million, 3 million children in the U.S. And we see data consistent with what we would expect. So, pending FDA approval, we are excited by another contribution and tailwind to our top-line. This is a patient population that maybe the parents will be a little more sensitive to our box warning, but at the same time, it's 2 million, 3 million patients and children that we potentially have the opportunity to help going forward.\n\nAnd we're very excited by the potential opportunity to help two, three million children in the U.S., and we see data consistent with what we would expect. So, pending FDA approval, we are excited by another contribution and tailwind to our top line. This is a patient population that maybe the parents will be a little more sensitive to our box warning, but at the same time, it's two, three million patients and children that we potentially have the opportunity to help going forward.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nOn the busy side, maybe, Christiana, you can -\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYes. Sure. So Salveen, as you commented on, we have a strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to have a strong balance sheet following the Escient acquisition. So, as of the end of this quarter, we have $3.9 billion of cash. We don't have any debt, which obviously that could give us additional firepower. So, that puts us in a position to be able to look at additional opportunities. And that's something that we are continuing to explore.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Eric Schmidt from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\n\nEric Schmidt\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nThanks for taking my question. Maybe just following on Salveen's question on capital redeployment. Can you talk about your broader strategy there about also whether you consider returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend or a share buyback in addition to potentially using cash to expand your business?\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nI can take that. I mean it's - we have been speaking about acquisition and external opportunities, which is obviously one very clear goal for the corporation is to diversify our revenue in the future and to increase to the growth coming from the current portfolio that we have. So, that's one option. And obviously, as we are doing with our Board, there are discussions about alternatives to that. But today, as you have seen with Escient, I mean there are opportunities that are very much in the range of what we are looking for in terms of timing and in terms of therapeutic areas, and that would be an interest. So, we are basically looking at both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\n\nJay Olson\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nHi, congrats on the progress of your KRASG12D. It seems like Incyte is increasingly focused on targeted oncology versus immuno-oncology. Can you describe your strategy in oncology? And also, how are you planning to leverage your oral PD-L1 for your targeted oncology programs, in combination with your KRASG12D, or do you plan to develop additional KRAS inhibitors? Thank you.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nYes. So, thank you for the question. So, your observation is correct. We are moving more aggressively into targeted oncology and trying to shift away from immuno-oncology. And that's a journey that has started a little bit over a year ago, and we intend to accelerate in the future. The idea here is well-defined patient populations, large treatment effect ideally single-agent activity with early proof-of-concept, and that will allow us to have much more efficient drug development process to accelerate some of these programs. We are very excited about the G12D program. We think it has the potential to be best-in-class. And as you point out, one of the things that we can leverage is we have access to what we believe is the most advanced for sure, oral PD-L1 inhibitor, and that will allow us to do oral-oral combinations in patients with a range of indications. And that applies also to the rest of the pipeline. And as I mentioned that journey will continue to accelerate in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Your line is now live.\n\nMatt Phipps\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'll ask about the CALR-mutant antibody and data in early 2025, will that be monotherapy or mono and JAKAFI combo and also myelofibrosis only or also including essential thrombocytopenia? And I guess just from a high level, the combination with JAKAFI, is that primarily to provide faster symptom relief? Or do you think, it is just kind of necessary to achieve efficacy for the antibody?\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nSo, we haven't decided exactly the scope of the data disclosure for the mutant-CALR antibody later this year. What I can tell you is that plan is to combine the mutant-CALR antibody with JAKAFI. And the idea there is, as you know, and we pointed out many times, Jakafi has a profound effect on symptom relief in these patients, which we believe, early in the management of the disease, could be very important even in the presence of a mutant-CALR antibody. The idea of mutant-CALR antibody here, as you know, is to transform - is to change the treatment objective to really eradicate the malignant clone. But still a potential early treatment or induction with JAKAFI could be very, very helpful for patients. And regarding the other part of your question, yes, we will have data in MF and ET as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Two from me. One, just taking a step back looking at P&L management. How do you think about being most efficient with your OpEx? And then, kind of a follow-up there. Would you ever consider using some of your balance sheet to, say, do buybacks, especially with the stock in the $50s? And then just as you think about your positioning in the derm space, a lot of focus on OPZELURA. Where do you want to win over the next five years when it comes to derm? Where do you think Incyte is best-suited to really take share? Maybe you can walk me through some of the most exciting parts of your pipeline in your view. Thank you.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nOkay. So, I think the first question was about the efficiency of the spending. So, as you see, I mean, we have in our P&L, we had a relatively - this quarter, we had a very flat SG&A and a relatively slower growing R&D. And that is what we have been speaking about for years now is basically growing the top-line at a faster rate than we are growing both components of the expenses and increasing leverage. So, that's sort of happening. They are depending on the event on the quarterly, it is not always at the same rate, but it is clearly the direction that we are taking. Concerning the buyback, I spoke about it. What I'm basically saying is that nothing is excluded from discussions, and that is something that is certainly part of the current dialogue. And now in the dermatology, maybe Pablo, if you want to speak about, or Steven, on the -\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.",
    "content2": "I'm happy to comment. Look, I think what we are building is an important portfolio of first-in-class or best-in-class in some cases, best-in-disease medicines in the - I would expand the questions in the inflammation space. And I think, that was a key driver of the acquisition of Escient to complement that with two first-in-class medicines, 262 and 547, that can really address a range of indications. We believe that that added to the portfolio that we have with POVORCITINIB, which is [inaudible] pipeline within a drug, we can win across a range of indications by providing patients and payers with a portfolio approach to some of these diseases, including prurigo nodularis, atopic dermatitis and now the new inflammatory diseases.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Ren Benjamin from Citizens JMP. Your line is now live.\n\nRen Benjamin\n\nHi, great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of quick ones. One on JAKAFI XR. Can you provide any sort of an update as to how that's progressing? And as you think about the strategy going forward, is this something that you are already starting to evaluate in combinations? Or do you only start doing that after an approval? And then, just as a follow-up, tafasitamab, just wanted to get your thoughts on the FL-MCL data that's coming out. Is this - is really going to be meaningful from a commercial perspective as the real opportunity in first-line DLBCL, which is expected in 2025? Thanks.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo Ren, it's Steven answering your question. So, as Pablo said in remarks earlier this year, the XR process is underway with the regulators in terms of doing bioavailability and then followed by BE work. That will include stability it's about a two-year process, which we expect to complete in a way in time for the LOE. And the idea there is obviously to have the once daily available in time. It doesn't change any of our FDC work. We can still do fixed-dose combination work with BET and ALKs as we need to do, and we continue to progress those. In terms of tafasitamab, the studies are complete, both in mind and front mine. So, the low-grade follicular and marginal zone lymphoma study will be in the second half of this year. And in the first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma probably in Q1 2025. And we await that data. We know we have an active - very active and well-tolerated regimen in lymphomas, and we look forward to that data.\n\nAs someone also brought up earlier there, and Pablo said, there is also interest now potentially in autoimmune work with CD19 antibodies, and that's something we're just looking at, at the moment. To the meat of your question, yes, we very much expect the data to be meaningful with a well-tolerated active regimen, and we look forward to those data sets. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Gavin Clark-Gartner from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\n\nGavin Clark-Gartner\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nHi, thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask one quick clarification on the CALR data. Did you note that you're planning to show some of that data later this year? Or could that still be a 2025 event?\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nWe haven't provided specific guidance. I think we said 2025. So, if I imply 2024, I apologize for misunderstanding but it’s - 2025 is the goal.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you all for participating in the call today and for your questions. The IR team will be available for questions throughout the day. Thank you and goodbye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.\nYou may be placed in the question queue at any time by pressing star one on your telephone keypad and we ask you to please ask one question and one follow-up. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ben Strain, Associate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ben.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investors' section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides to follow today's discussion. On today's call, I'm joined by Herve, Barry, Pablo, Steven and Christiana who will deliver our prepared remarks and will participate in the Q&A.\nI would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. I will now hand the call over to Herve.\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you Ben and good morning everyone. So on slide five we achieved another strong year with 2023 with our royalty revenues growing 14% up from 2022 to reach $3.7 billion considering the strong performance we have delivered since 2018. We also achieved a [inaudible] milestone in the fourth quarter. Total product and royalty revenue reached 1 billion quarterly for the first time driven by the continued growth of JAKAFI and successful launch of OPZELURA. \nSo moving to slide six, 2023 JAKAFI net sales were $2.6 billion growing 8% after the prior year with growth across all indications year over year. And OPZELURA saw strong momentum in 2023 growing 162% to $338 million, driven by new patients and repeat in both [inaudible] and vitiligo. We expect OPZELURA to continue to be a key contributor to growth in the next year. \nOn slide seven, our clinical pipeline has the ability to deliver transformative therapies to patients across multiple programs and provides the opportunity for 10 high impact launches by 2030 as presented recently in San Francisco.\nImportantly, some of the programs highlighted on this slide [inaudible] proof of concept including [inaudible] which has been submitted to the FDA for approval, [inaudible] in pediatric atopic dermatitis to be submitted to the FDA by mid year, [inaudible] in HS where we have randomized phase two data and [inaudible] where we are in phase III in HS vitiligo and in PN, where we are on track to initiate the phase III studies this year. Each of these programs has the potential to address a significant market and provide an opportunity to contribute to the top line before the end of the decade.\nI would also like now to highlight the recent transaction with [inaudible] is on slide eight. As described in the press release we issued last week, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with [inaudible] which give us exclusive global rights for [inaudible] also known as [inaudible]. This acquisition provides a number of benefits to insight in the short term. First going forward we will now record all revenues from [inaudible] in the US while eliminating opposite shares of the royalties ex-US and all future milestones to [inaudible].\nSecondly, we will realize significant operating efficiencies and cost synergies in US commercialization and in global development by removing redundant position or redundant external expenses and by simplifying the options. Therefore, in 2024, the deal will add to Incyte's revenue and will have a limited impact on operating income. For the future [inaudible] approved indication of relapse refractory [inaudible] represent a smaller opportunity for bevacizumab, we see upside potential in second line lollicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma with phase III data expected later this year and in first line [inaudible] this year for which phase III data are expected in 2025. These programs have been co funded by [inaudible] Incyte will fully benefit from the upside from this indication. And this acquisition would be value accretive for Incyte in all scenarios. I will now turn the call over to Barry who will discuss our commercial performance in more detail.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you Herve and good morning everyone. Starting with JAKAFI on slide 10, in the fourth quarter, JAKAFI's net product revenue grew 7% year over year to $695 million and grew 8% for the full year to $2.6 billion. Total patients increased 6% in 2023 with growth being seen across all indications. We experienced some variation in JAKAFI dynamics during the fourth quarter, including an increase in patients on free drug as well as in inventory fluctuations. Recall inventory drew down modestly in Q3 and rebounded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we anticipate the increase in patients on free drug seen at the end of 2023 to reverse and return to more normalized levels through '2024 supported by the lower out of pocket expenses under the part D redesign. Christiana will provide more details on these dynamics in her prepared remarks.\nWe continue and we expect continued growth of JAKAFI and have updated the full year net product revenue guidance for 2024 to a range of $2.69 to $2.75 billion. As highlighted on slide 11, JAKAFI continues to maintain its leadership and market share in MF driven by its unmatched product profile. Based on market research, other competitors have not had an impact on JAKAFI in regards to total patient market share or new patients and is consistent with our expectations. JAKAFI demand remained strong and we expect continued future growth driven by maintaining its leadership as standard of care in myelofibrosis, growth opportunities in polycythemia vera and chronic graft versus host disease as well as earlier use in chronic GVHD. Additionally, we anticipate the positive changes in out of pocket expenses for Medicare part D patients to contribute to the growth in the coming years with the biggest impact starting in 2025.\nTurning to slide 12 and OPZELURA's fourth quarter performance. OPZELURA net product revenues in the fourth quarter were $109 million, up 78% when compared to the same quarter last year. Total 2023 full year net sales grew 162% versus 2022 to reach $338 million. US patient demand increased during the quarter with total prescriptions growing 77% year over year and refills growing by 22% versus the prior quarter.\nThe weekly prescription trend as shown on the right demonstrates typical end of Q4 dynamics as well as the continued growth of OPZELURA which is coming from both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. In AD, growth was primarily driven by OPZELURA's efficacy and impact on inflammation and itch. In vitiligo, where OPZELURA is the only approved treatment for re pigmentation growth was driven largely by refills improved access and our educational initiatives.\nWe remain very optimistic about the long term potential of OPZELURA as we continue to see strong uptake. The launch continues to be strong indicating positive momentum with both physicians and patients as OPZELURA becomes established as one of the best recent dermatology launches.\nLooking at the first 27 months post FDA approval, OPZELURA continues to outperform other dermatology products on a launch aligned basis when measured by monthly dermatologist prescribed TRXs on the left and when comparing quarterly net revenues on the right, the successful launch of OPZELURA is driven by its compelling product profile, its ability to address significant unmet need in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and our strong market access relative to competition, where we continue to improve access and growing net sales.\nTurning to slide 14, we have a number of initiatives in place for OPZELURA to drive demand in 2024 in both AD and vitiligo. We know that based on OPZELURA's compelling efficacy and safety, health care professionals want to use OPZELURA sooner in the treatment algorithm. In addition to securing improved access for 2024, we are also continuing to look for ways to improve utilization management and we have an exceptional value proposition that supports these advancements. For vitiligo, we continue to drive patient awareness through consistent marketing campaigns with the goal of educating and inspiring these patients with positive, real world patient experiences. We believe this will drive further demand and activate patients to discuss treatment options with their dermatologist.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you Barry and good morning everyone. I want to highlight some of the key R&D milestones that we accomplished in 2023 and to provide a framework for how we are evolving our R&D focus with a near term goal to increase the rigor of our decision making, accelerate the progression of our pipeline and to optimize our resource allocation.\nAs you can see on slide 16, we have three areas of focus where we're building a robust and diverse portfolio of medicines for the treatment of MP and [inaudible] host disease, oncology, and inflammatory diseases. We're advancing our pipeline to deliver impactful innovation with a focus on best-in-class and our first-in-class differentiated medicines in areas with large unmet medical need.\nOur discovery process is target and pathway centric and leverages cross program knowledge and deep biology expertise and our established disease areas of interest to identify and prosecute novel targets as well as disease in genotype specific dependencies with a modality agnostic approach.\nIn addition to our established small molecule expertise, we have expanded our drug discovery capabilities to include monoclonal antibody discovery in house and have access to bi specific antibody discovery capabilities through our partnership with Maris.\nTurning now to slide 17, we made significant advancements across all three priority areas of focus in the R&D portfolio in 2023. In MPNs and graft versus host disease, we submitted the BLA for [inaudible] for the treatment in third line chronic graft versus host disease. We presented updates for our bet and out two inhibitors in MF and highlighted our new potentially transformative therapies for MF, PV, and ET, our mutant callout monoclonal antibody which is enrolling well in a phase one study and our Jack 2B 617F inhibitor for which we plan to initiate a phase one study in the next month.\nIn oncology, we initiated several monotherapy and combination studies with our small molecule oral PDL-1 inhibitor and highlighted early signs of clinical activity with our small molecule CDK2 inhibitor. Additionally, we unveiled a new program in development, are KRS12D inhibitor, which entered the clinic earlier this year. Steven will provide more detail on the KRS12D program in his prepared remarks.\nIn dermatology, we continue to maximize the potential of [inaudible] cream. In 2023, OPZELURA was approved in Europe for vitiligo as the first and only approved treatment for re pigmentation. We also presented positive phase III data in pediatric atopic dermatitis and announced that the primary endpoint was met in a randomized phase II study in patients with [inaudible]. For [inaudible], we presented positive randomized phase II data in vitiligo and initiated two phase III studies for patients with extensive vitiligo.\nWe also announced that [inaudible] had met the primary endpoint in a randomized phase II study in patients with [inaudible] and we initiated two randomized phase two studies one for patients with asthma and another in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. We believe that with [inaudible] cream and [inaudible] we'll be the only company with the ability to address a broad spectrum of patients from mild to severe potentially providing both a topical and oral option for a number of indications, including [inaudible] Hidradenitis Suppurativa and vitiligo. But from an exhaustive list of all the R&D achievements in the past year, this demonstrates that 2023 was a very successful impactful year for Incyte and it serves as a foundation for a number of pivotal trials that will deliver results in the next few years.\nAs you can see from slide 18, we anticipate that 2024 will be another very exciting year with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones. Steven will provide more details on these but I would like to highlight certain events. Within our oncology pipeline, we believe that our potentially best in class CDK-2 inhibitor is an active agent and we look forward to sharing data as well as our development plan later this year. In addition, the pivotal trial of [inaudible] in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma also known as N mind will read out later this year and we look forward to sharing those results. We submitted the BLA for [inaudible] late last year, and we look forward to working with the FDA to make [inaudible] available to patients with chronic graft versus host disease later this year and to initiate additional combination studies in patients with less pretreated chronic graft versus host disease.\nWithin our dermatology portfolio, we expect to submit the NDA for OPZELURA for pediatric atopic dermatitis and expect multiple data readouts throughout the year. With that, I would like to pass the call to Steven who will provide further details on our clinical development pipeline.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you Pablo. Starting on slide 20, in December, we presented more than 40 hematology and oncology abstracts, including a plenary presentation at the ASH annual meeting.\nKey highlights included a plenary scientific session, which featured the full data from AGAVE201 evaluating [inaudible], an anti CSF1R monoclonal antibody in patients with chronic graft versus host disease and additional data from the phase one two study of [inaudible] phase one data from our bet inhibitor and preclinical data of the JAK2B617F inhibitor.\nFor our bet inhibitor dose escalation is ongoing. In mono therapy and in combination therapy, we're seeing reductions in spleen lengths and volume as well as improvements in both symptoms and hemoglobin, suggesting that this is an active compound. We plan on advancing this program to phase III later this calendar year.\nAs we get closer, we will provide additional data details on study design and timing. Based on the efficacy and favorable safety profile seen in the phase II AGAVE 201 pivotal study, the BLA for [inaudible] was submitted to the FDA for approval for the treatment of patients with chronic graft versus host disease. We anticipate a decision by the FDA in the second half of 2024 and are excited by the possibility of bringing a new treatment option to these patients.\nWe continue to expand and advance our IAI dermatology portfolio as seen on slide 22. For [inaudible] cream, we recently presented positive phase III data in pediatric patients, where [inaudible] cream met its efficacy endpoints for both investigator global assessment treatment success and easy 75. We expect to submit the SNDA by the middle of 2024 with potential approval in 2025. We also disclosed that [inaudible] cream met the primary endpoint in the phase II study in mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa and we expect to present those results at a medical conference later this year, while a phase III study is being evaluated. [inaudible] cream is also currently being evaluated in two phase III studies in [inaudible] and two phase II studies in [inaudible] Sclerosis with data expected for both later this year.\n[inaudible] our oral JAK 1 inhibitor is currently being evaluated in phase III studies in hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo and we recently announced that [inaudible] met the primary endpoint of a greater than or equal to a four point improvement in the HNRS across all three treatment groups in a phase II study in [inaudible]. We expect the full data set at a medical conference later this year and phase III planning is underway. Our earliest stage dermatology program, our IL-15 receptor beta antibody has begun evaluation in healthy volunteers.\nMoving to slide 23, last week at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation Conference, we presented additional data from the open label extension of the phase II study of [inaudible] in HS. As a reminder, [inaudible] demonstrated dose dependent efficacy in patients with HS during the initial placebo controlled period at week 16. The data presented demonstrate that treatment with [inaudible] through week 52 resulted in a decrease in disease severity as classified by the international HS severity scoring system or IHS4. At week 52, the significant decrease in disease severity was observed with approximately 25% of patients achieving an IHS4 score of zero, which represents the complete resolution of abscess, nodule, and draining tunnels.\nOn slide 24, an additional analysis was maintenance response, which demonstrates that [inaudible] treated patients who achieved a response at week 16 were likely to maintain [inaudible] response through week 52. Both of these datasets build upon [inaudible] potential as a best-in-disease medicine for patients suffering from HS. As a reminder, two phase III studies evaluating [inaudible] in HS stop HS one and stop HS two are ongoing and enrolling very well.\nOur high potential oncology pipeline is currently focused on three advanced programs. The first is [inaudible], which is currently being evaluated in two phase III studies in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma and in patients with previously untreated diffuse large b cell lymphoma. We're expecting phase III results from follicular and marginal zone lymphoma or the in line study in the second half of this year with the first line diffuse large B cell lymphoma frontline study readout in 2025.\nThe second is our small molecule oral PDL1 program. We have multiple ongoing studies as monotherapy or in combination with other agents such as [inaudible] and we expect to have combination data later this calendar year. And the third program is a small molecule CDK-2 inhibitor, where we recently announced early signs of clinical activity with multiple patients demonstrating partial responses. We expect to share data as well as the development plan later this calendar year.\nOn slide 26, we recently announced that INCB 161734, a potent selective and orally available [inaudible] inhibitor recently entered the clinic in a phase one study. This program has shown encouraging preclinical antitumor activity in xenograft models with no currently approved G12B targeting agents could address a high unmet need. As a reminder, the KRSG12 mutation is found in approximately 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15% of colorectal cancer, and 5% of non small cell lung cancer and could thus represent a significant opportunity for Incyte if successful.\nIn summary, we anticipate a number of upcoming pipeline updates in 2024, including sharing top line results from both the phase II studies in [inaudible] cream in HS and [inaudible] at a medical conference in the first half of this year. The second half of the year is looking to be a catalyst rich period as highlighted on slide 20 that we anticipate includes but is not limited to an approval with [inaudible] phase III results from [inaudible] and the initiation of a number of phase III studies, including with our bet inhibitor. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you Steven and good morning everyone. 2023 was another year of strong financial performance with total product revenues of $862 million for the fourth quarter of the year and $3.2 billion for the full year, representing a 13 and 15% year over year increase respectively. Total royalty revenues, which are primarily comprised of royalties from Novartis for JAKAFI and [inaudible] and royalties from Lilly for [inaudible] were $150 million in the fourth quarter and $523 million for the full year, up 13 and 8% respectively compared to 2022. Total revenues grew 9% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, reaching the $1 billion mark, an important milestone for Incyte. For the full year, total revenues were $3.7 billion.\nTurning to JAKAFI on slide 30, JAKAFI net product revenues were $695 million for the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year 2023. In 2023, JAKAFI net sales grew 8% compared to the prior year. JAKAFI sales were negatively impacted by a significant increase in free drug in the fourth quarter of the year driven by an increase in the number of patients seeking support from Incyte's patient assistance program. The impact of the increase in [inaudible] was more than offset by an increase in channel inventory levels. This increase was in anticipation of patients moving into paid demand starting in Q1 of 2024. The increase in Q4 channel inventory levels represented $46 million in sales.\nTurning now to our OPZELURA, net product revenues for the fourth quarter were $109 million, representing a 78% increase year over year, driven primarily by increased patient demand. For the full year, total OPZELURA net product revenues were $338 million, representing a 162% increase compared to the prior year.\nMoving on to slide 32 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis, total R&D expenses were $444 million for the quarter, representing an 11% year over year decrease which was primarily as a result of the $70 million upfront payment made as part of the [inaudible] acquisition in Q4, 2022, and partially offset by the $20 million development milestone payments to former [inaudible] shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor the full year 2023, total R&D expenses were $1.6 billion, representing a 3% year over year increase. This increase was primarily due to the progression of our pipeline and was mainly offset by lower upfront and milestone expenses in '23.\nTotal SG&A expenses were $294 million for the fourth quarter, and $1.16 billion for the year. The year over year increase of 8% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year were mainly due to increased sales and marketing activities for OPZELURA in both the US and Europe, unfavorable effects and timing of certain G&A related expenses.\nMoving onto 2024, I will now discuss the key components of our guidance on a GAAP basis, which includes revenues and expenses related to the recent acquisition of the exclusive global rights to [inaudible] but excludes any potential impact related to the accounting treatment of the $25 million purchase price paid.\nFor JAKAFI, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.69 to $2.75 billion, on track to achieve our long term guidance of over $3 billion in net product revenues by 2028. We expect net product revenue growth to be driven exclusively by continued demand growth and be partially offset by lower net pricing as a result of IRA post price increase caps and continued growth in [inaudible] volumes.\nAs in previous years, we expect the gross to net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter of the year relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to the higher deductibles and our share of the donut hole for Medicare part D patients, which are primarily impacting the first quarter of the year.\nWhile for OPZELURA we will not be providing full year guidance at this point, in the first quarter, we expect to see again the effect of typical Q1 dynamics of net sales, including higher patient out of pocket costs due to the plan deductibles resetting at the beginning of the year and the impact of holidays, medical conferences and other events on dermatology product sale. As a result, Q1 OPZELURA net product revenues are expected to be below the previous quarters and subsequent quarters and represent a smaller share of the full year net product revenues, consistent with what we saw in 2023. For other [inaudible] oncology products, which now include [inaudible], we expect total net product revenues to be in the range of $325 million to $360 million, which at the midpoint represents approximately 47% growth over '23.\nTurning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis, we expect Cogs to range from 7% to 8% of net product revenues, which is in line with 2023. R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.76 million, representing 7% growth at the midpoint versus 2023, primarily driven by the progression of our pipeline. We expect SG&A expense for the year to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.24 billion, representing 6% year over year growth at the midpoint, primarily driven by the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with [inaudible] in the US under SG&A, whereas prior to the acquisition of full product rights they were included under the collaboration profit or loss share.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks, please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to be placed in the question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to move your question from the queue.

Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. On JAKAFI myelofibrosis thank you so much for providing the market share details in all patients and new patients. I guess when do you anticipate stabilization of JAKAFI shares at these levels and if collaborative work can be approved in combination with [inaudible] assuming it happens sometime next year should we expect to see an inflection point? Thank you.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo stabilization of market share in myelofibrosis, so JAKAFI as you know is the leader in myelofibrosis because of its safety, efficacy, overall survival and really tolerability, which is really a big advantage. We think that myelofibrosis will continue to be the largest proportion of our patient share until polycythemia vera patients ultimately take over because as you know those patients stay on for a long period of time.\nYour question around [inaudible], if and when it gets approved in combination with JAKAFI of course, that's a good thing for us if in fact the profile of the drug as it appears or the combinations as it appears then many physicians may choose to use that combination and JAKAFI will only benefit, but we have to wait and see what happens with the approval process.\n\nUnknown\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Berens from Leerink. Your line is now live.\n\nAndrew Berens\n\nAnalyst, SVB Leerink LLC\n\nAlright. I'm wondering if you guys could expand upon the development of JAKAFI XR in light of the recently announced spin off by Novartis for liver cirrhosis. Does Novartis' control of JAKAFI outside the US impact how you're thinking about developing your bet inhibitor? Do they have any direction or [inaudible] the directions of the XR version of JAKAFI? And then also I'm wondering if you think that an add on drug to JAKAFI that still require dramatic improvement as an endpoint for regulatory enforcement or do you think this has been a material change in [inaudible]?\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nSo let me take the piece about our agreement with Novartis on JAKAFI and Steven can speak about the development of XR. So the agreement is such that both parties can be co developing new formulations of [inaudible] in oncology, including the once a day. It has not been the case yet, but there is still an optionality from Novartis to co-develop XR if they wish and that would mean that they would be able to commercialize the XR formulation outside of the US, but not in the US, where obviously it would be commercialized by Incyte.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nAnd then Andy I'll take the other part of your question. So for [inaudible] XR as Pablo communicated at the ASH Investor event, we have now clear feedback from the FDA that we need to do a new formulation strength, which are already developed which are slightly higher and then demonstrate the EVA with those primarily around [inaudible] and AUC. That's the clear guidance from the FDA and we estimate this should be completed in a two year process, so well before the LOE. It doesn't affect our development of FTC's fixed dose combinations with any of our products so that continues.\nFor our bet inhibitor again, we showed data at ASH and alluded in my prepared remarks, we have clearly an active compound showing very good rates of spleen reduction both volume and length, very good symptom improvement and occasional hemoglobin increases just like we've seen with the other bet inhibitor. We have been operating like other companies under the assumption that at least in first line you need SCR thirty-five and symptoms to date to get approvals. I can't comment on where they are in their regulatory process or how the FDA may change in that regard, but that has been the standard to date.\n\nAndrew Berens\n\nAnalyst, SVB Leerink LLC\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim. Your line is now live.\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I had one on [inaudible] as we think about the opportunity for this drug in multiple indications, I believe the HS Phase III trial is most advanced. Could you talk a bit about your expectations on how the drug may be positioned relative to some of the biologics in HS, humira or some of the IL-17 antibodies? And then also in PN where you had the positive topline data last year, [inaudible] is obviously approved here, again, could you talk a bit about how the drug might be fitting into that treatment paradigm relative to [inaudible]? Thanks so much.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nMichael, hi, it's Steven. I'll start with your question. Thank you for the question. So [inaudible] in HS, we think we have outstanding efficacy data, which we've now updated with a 52-week data that shows prolonged effect that's maintained. And so remember this is a JAK-1 specific agent, about 50 folks selective for JAK-1 has a long half life and a very high volume of distribution, which may translate to more penetration in the skin, which is why we're seeing this degree of efficacy showing to date.\nBoth phase III stop HS one and HS two are enrolling very, very well so it probably speaks to some of the belief out there in the agent and that is clearly our lead indication as you alluded to. It's hard to always cross compare with many caveats to other other studies where drugs aren't directly compared and you spoke about the IL seventeens here in the biologics. And clearly there's some variable activity there. You have to look at placebo corrected rates, but I think ours tackles multiple aspects of the disease pathophysiology, not just one interleukin and as I said, the drug profile with a long half life and high volume of distribution may lend itself to increase efficacy. Obviously time will tell with the phase III data. It'll be a once daily oral tablet which offers that sort of convenience.\nIn PN, what patients suffer from primarily is intense itching and again, our phase II proof of concept data is very strong in terms of the itch relief here and the ability to eliminate that symptom pretty quickly as well as over time disease resolution in the actual skin manifestations. There is, as you alluded to an approved agent in DUPIXENT but that has provided us the regulatory pathway on the way to go in terms of itch resolution and skin change resolution. And again, we'll offer the once daily oral convenience. We think we'll have a really good agents in terms of high efficacy there, so we're excited about this program as well. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from [inaudible] from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. We have two on the pipeline. So first for the [inaudible] two program, you've guided to POC data by mid '24, we were just wondering what we can expect to learn with this update and what you will be reviewing specifically to decide what the next step of development could be for this program. And then secondly for the [inaudible] antibody, when can you expect to see initial phase one data there and what are you hoping to establish to get conviction that the program is headed in the right direction? Thank you.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nYes, thank you for the question. This is Pablo. So for the [inaudible] inhibitor program, what we're in the process of doing and what we need to establish is efficacy in a larger number of patients with newly diagnosed MF in combination with [inaudible] and that's what the team is focused on right now and as we mentioned at ASH last December. So we're continuing to push the dose, we need to get to doses of around 400 to 600 mg a day in order to get to maximum effect on [inaudible] 2, we need a longer duration of therapy in a larger group of patients in combination with rux. So that will happen over the course of the year. We haven't provided a specific timeline for when we're going to disclose the data, but as we mentioned at ASH last year, it would happen this year and we'll provide clarity on what the next steps for that program are. \nOn the second question for the [inaudible] antibody program, we started dose escalation very recently as you know. That study is accruing very well. The initial our goals like for any first in human study are obviously to establish that the [inaudible] antibody is safe. We've got a good view of the pharmacokinetics in this first in human study and establish initial evidence of efficacy, which in this case will be by traditional endpoints in MPNs and also potentially a view on the [inaudible] monoclonal antibody [inaudible] real burden in some of those patients. That will happen over the course of the year. We haven't decided yet when we're gonna present data whether it's this year, whether at some point in 2025. \n\nUnknown\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nGood morning. This is [inaudible] on for Salveen, thank you for taking our question. We had one question on OPZLURA. Outside of the 1Q dynamics that you spoke to, can you help us understand the forward launch trajectory in AVM vitiligo in the context of reimbursement and access and also gross to net in order to be fully able to capture the opportunity as you have additional indications coming in the coming years?  Thank you.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. So of course as far as launch trajectory, we're continuing to launch very well in both AD and vitiligo. We continue to expect growth in vitiligo just based upon our educational efforts directed both as patients and health care professionals. We know that the profile in AD in terms of its relief and clearance of the skin is unmatched for any topical therapy. We even believe that in AD for example, the profile is so good that as far as payers are concerned they are interested in the fact that more than 80% of the patients will be clear and have their itch relieved and can delay or not even go on to a biologic. So we think those dynamics are good for both AD and vitiligo going forward and we're looking forward to future growth. I'll turn the call over to Christiana to talk about gross to net.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo in terms of our gross to net, first of all, when you look at 2023, the average gross to net was around 55%. Our goal is to maximize the value of OPZELURA and maximize net sales. If going forward we make the decision to provide any additional discounts, it would be because we expect that these will improve access and will have a disproportionate impact on volume and that lead to higher net sales. As such, our comments they are going to be focused on net sales versus gross to net in isolation. \n\nUnknown\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from [inaudible] from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to piggyback on the last, just in terms of OPZELURA, is there one, any chance we get an update in terms of potential guidance for this year and then will you ever look to kind of breakout both kind of vitiligo and AD kind of scripts or sales if you can figure that out? And then secondly, just on [inaudible] can you quantify maybe the incremental growth opportunities you see for this asset in the follicular and marginal zone lymphoma indications? Thanks.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo as far as breaking out AD versus vitiligo, I think we've said before, it's about 60% currently for AD, 40% currently for vitiligo. It could be changing a little bit. Ultimately, we expect vitiligo to perhaps surpass AD. AD patients are many new patients who have come on for atopic dermatitis and in vitiligo, it's about continued use and refills.\nAs far as [inaudible] goes, obviously, we're looking forward to hopefully positive data in follicular lymphoma, [inaudible] lymphoma and in first line diffuse large B cell lymphoma. So we think there are great opportunities ahead for these two indications. We think it's a great drug for lymphoma. Obviously, it's a crowded marketplace, but we think the profile of the drug and the trials we've put together for those two new indications are going to serve us well in the future.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nBut in terms of calibration of follicular lymphoma we need to see the phase III data. So clearly it's a fairly competitive space. There are a lot of new products so we need to see the phase III data before we can give you a good calibration of that. I mean, the number of patients we are speaking about in the US is around--\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\n79,000 patients in first line diffuse large B cell lymphoma. There's about 13,000 patients in second line plus in follicular lymphoma in the United States.\n\nUnknown\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from David Lebowitz from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Neil Lebowitz\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. [inaudible] the fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by the number of Medicare part D patients receiving free products, could you perhaps elaborate on this? And also looking ahead to 2024 and '25, you had spoken about how IRA dynamics could shift which will drive PV share, could you possibly give us some way to quantify the potential impacts of this shift over time? Thank you.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo to answer the first question, in Q4, we saw a significant increase in patients seeking assistance from Incyte in the form of free drug of course. We know that these are paid patients who had Medicare part D and our assumption is these patients were receiving financial assistance from independent charitable foundations to cover their out of pocket expenses. This assistance was no longer valuable to them apparently towards the end of the year and of course, they came to us and they met our eligibility criteria for free drug. With the changes in Medicare in 2024, as you know, the out of pocket in 2024 for Medicare part D is greatly reduced therefore, we expect these patients to return to being paid patients. And in fact, we know already that many of these patients already have.\nIn terms of 2024 and 2025 and the changes to Medicare part D, we think it's been very positive. We've been saying it for a long time that these co pays out of pocket cost for cancer patients who are on Medicare part D, it was very much too high and should be reduced and in fact they probably are still too high. But because of the way it happens in 2025, $2000 maximum out of pockets they can spread that out over throughout the year, so they pay about $167 per month for a 12 month period, we think that there's lots of patients perhaps over the years who have walked away, who abandoned the drug because they could not afford these out of pocket costs. We think that there's an opportunity at least for those patients who abandon drug or just thought they could not afford the drug now that the Medicare part D is greatly reduced, they could come back or opt into the drug therapy now.\n\nDavid Neil Lebowitz\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Jessica Fye from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and a couple of follow ups on some of the previous questions. What's your expectation for the proportion of JAKAFI patients receiving free drug in 2024? And then on OPZELURA for Europe, how are you expecting the average price to shake out for vitiligo and can you recap your latest thinking on pursuing AD there? And then in the US, I think you mentioned the recent script trends reflect kind of normal year end seasonality, is that to say you expect the volume reacceleration near term? I wasn't sure how to reconcile that with some of the other 1Q comments you made about OPZELURA. Thank you.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nOkay, I'll try to answer the first and third question and maybe ask Herve to talk about Europe. So the expectation for free drug is easy for JAKAFI. It's been 3% to 4% of our volume for years and years and years. We expect it to go back. We think this is a one time exceptional thing that happened because of the changes coming for Medicare part D. So again, no more than it has been historically, which is around three or 4% of our volume.\nAs far as when we talked about seasonality, we do expect the first quarter to be down mostly because of the changes, because of out-of-pocket expenses, because of deductibles, because of the resetting of the copays, but then we should go back to our acceleration in volume in the second quarter, third quarter and so on. And Herve, Europe.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nIn Europe, OPZELURA launched in Germany and Austria in February. It's commercially available. The price there is 750 Euros for a 100 gram tube. And then we have recently received reimbursement in France in a process called [inaudible], which is a way to make--It's one of the first product [inaudible] to be part of the program and that gives access to patients through a special distribution system and while the price is being discussed. The price discussion will probably take ten months and we will start booking sales or recognizing revenue in France when the price is finally approved so that should be late this year in the best case. And then we are also in the process of getting a reimbursement in other countries in Europe so hopefully we will get the multiple countries launching in the '24 and '25. Regarding atopic dermatitis, we decided obviously to start with vitiligo for a reimbursement reason because it's a better case, leading to a better price in most of these countries and we have ongoing studies that have been in fact started relatively recently that could be used if we want to have a limited label in atopic dermatitis, which would be required to be able to maintain the price. So that process is ongoing and it's not going to lead to a new indication in the next two years, it would be coming October.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nTazeen Ahmad\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was just curious as to the payer mix differences if there are any for OPZELURA between the AD indication versus like vitiligo. And then secondly, as both of these launches start to mature a bit, do you have a better sense of how you're going to land a number of tubes on average use per patient for a full year?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nAs far as the payer mix goes, there's no real difference between payer mix. For AD, more patients perhaps have step therapies in vitiligo and more patients\ndon't have any steps or have one step. In terms of the number of tubes, we have said in the past that for AD it's around two tubes to a little bit more. We think that will continue to grow as people use the drug over larger portions of the body, obviously they can go up to 10-20% body surface area, which is a very large body surface area. Some people started out in sensitive areas and now they'll continue to use it over a larger period of their skin. For vitiligo, it's just too early, we'll figure out, but we're anticipating obviously as we've said the refills will be much greater in vitiligo compared to AD.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Marc Frahm from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nMarc Frahm\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nHi, yes, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe following up on a couple of the the paradynamic questions. On JAKAFI, can you quantify the level of [inaudible] and things like that that you are seeing in terms of what this opportunity is for volume gains with this redesign, recognizing that some of it's not going to play out over just in one year? And then similarly for OPZELURA you had some formulary wins late last year that came into effect at the beginning of the year, Christiana to your comment of only wanting to give price concessions to see enough volume benefit to end up in a net sales method, are you seeing early returns from that that are consistent with that view or do you kind of need to recalibrate how you do those negotiations for next year to make sure that that trend is kept?\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure Mark, Barry here. So quantified a level of a script abandonment for JAKAFI, we don't actually know. We know that it's at least 10% just because we know when we go to specialty pharmacies the patients who go through specialty pharmacies, we have a little bit more data there or clarity there and it's at least 10%, but we don't know. People who scripts never gets sent to a pharmacy, we don't know about that. So we're not exactly sure, but we think there's a significant portion of patients that could benefit from JAKAFI specifically that aren't because of the out of pocket [inaudible] that's getting better and better all the time, we hope in 2024 and 2025.\nAs far as OPZELURA goes and formulary wins, for example, CVS that got changed this year to preferred status with a one step therapy for AD, no step therapies for vitiligo, it's a little bit too soon to see anything because obviously, when CVS makes a decision with us it takes a while to funnel down to the various plans at the local level.\n\nMarc Frahm\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from Ren Benjamin from Citizens JMP. Your line is now live.\n\nRen Benjamin\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Given the rumors of your bids from [inaudible], are you considering any other acquisitions in the MS space or was the rumor incorrect the whole time and you are just going after the Tapa? That's question number one. Question number two back even on the JAKAFI XR, I'd love to get a little bit more color on the two years that it takes to get to the end of this, to solve this issue. What really is kind of involved in this and the probability of success I would think it would be just quite high, just for a lack of a better word an engineering problem, but maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. \n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation",
    "content2": "Maybe on the first question, as I said, I think the Tapa acquisition for us is [inaudible] in fact, very, very asymmetric because as I said with all of the synergies we can realize in the short term it can compensate for what is left in terms of development growth in these two indications where in fact most of the development has already been paid for in the past year. So it is a case where the actual impact on the bottom line will be very minimal in the short term and very positive in the long term. Whatever the scenario of the new indication is.\nNow if any of this new indication is hitting and is positive then it becomes obviously [inaudible] because we get all the benefit in terms of top line so that's the aspect. Now in the field of myelofibrosis, as you can see from our pipeline we have a number of projects that we are pursuing our self. We have our own bet [inaudible] program, where as Pablo was saying there is some additional data that we need to get certainty, but it's very promising and obviously we have the [inaudible] program on top of the XR formulation. So all of that is giving us a very full pipeline in the field of myelofibrosis, so that would not be the first priority for acquisitions.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nThen Ren, your question on XR, so just to go back to the CRL, remember when we did that submission, we missed on C-Min to a small degree that per the FDA resulted in a theoretical concern on efficacy and then we tried to do some more population PK analyses in that to reassure them, but that pathway didn't work and as we gave more granular details end of last year, the route forward is a new formulation, slightly larger tablet size, and then repeat BEBA work. And you're right, it doesn't take a great length of time, but to get that data in, analyze it, put it into a package and send it to the FDA and then have the discussions, an approximation or best guess is an approximately two year journey from the beginning of this year to get it done. And that we feel has enough conservatism in it that we should make it.\nIn terms of probability of success, we can model from the formulations what we will likely achieve in terms of area under the curve C-Min and even actually C-Max as well and we think that is relatively high obviously, that's why we're doing it. We will share that data as it becomes available and then take it to the regulatory agencies. Thanks.\n\nRen Benjamin\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, everyone. This is Evan on for Brian. Thank you for taking our questions. We just have a couple of questions. So on OPZELURA, what is the latest that you're kind of seeing on patient retentions so far, how many patients persisted through the six to 12 months so far to kind of see the benefit versus how many are kind of dropping off for perhaps seeing early efficacy. And then if you could speak to a little bit of the education around the retention strategies as well.\nAnd then a second question on the MF space, so as you kind of see the entry of additional competitors into the space, do you potentially foresee an expansion of the market as these competitors enter? Thank you.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure Evin, this is Barry. So as far as patient retention I guess, what you mean is that how many patients. So obviously the vitiligo patients stay on it for a much longer period of time. Of course, atopic dermatitis patients, patients with eczema, they have flares, they use OPZELURA, it goes away, and it's very effective so some patients get immediate release. Obviously, we talk about the itch relief all the time, they get good itch relief and then the skin becomes clearer over time. So these patients will come back we think year after year as long as they have their eczema and use the drug when they see the flares until it goes away and then start using it again.\nVitiligo patients we've seen from our long term data patients can use the drug for two years and continue to get benefit so that's what we keep on reinforcing around education, so that patients understand how to use the drug, what they're going to see at three months, six months, nine months, 12 months and beyond and that's how we'll continue to retain them. Yeah, it's very important the strategies around patients adherence, particularly for vitiligo, and particularly we know we can make improvements around what health care professionals, dermatologists in their offices are telling their patients how to use the drug and then the patients themselves understanding how to use the drug.\nAs far as competitors in the MF space, there are three other JAK inhibitors approved for myelofibrosis where we continue to be the market leader in myelofibrosis, we'll continue to be. As far as the combinations that have been studied recently, we'll see. But it certainly does expand the market because you have the opportunity of going early, earlier patients starting, we know if they start early with JAKAFI their survival advantages could be better. And then in fact, they'll go to second line drugs and third line drugs. So, yes, we've created the market and it could expand if there are good drugs approved after JAKAFI.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Your line is now live.\n\nMatt Phipps\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nThanks for squeezing me in. I'll just ask one on the CDK-2 inhibitor. I'm curious if you can comment on the safety profile you've seen so far if you're seeing any [inaudible]?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you for the question. We have not. We are happy with the safety profile so far which is consistent with the mechanism of CDK-2 inhibition and we have not seen ocular toxicity, which as you know led to a clinical hold in one of our competitors. So we're very excited about the early data for our CDK-2 inhibitor as we mentioned and we look forward to sharing data over the course of the year as well as our future development plans for the CDK-2 inhibitor program. \n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We reached end of our question and answer session, I would like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you for participating in today's call and for your questions.

If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.\n\nYou may place a question into the question queue at any time by pressing star one on your telephone keypad.\n\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ben Strain, Associate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investor's section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides that follow the discussion related to today's call.\n\nOn today's call I'm joined by Herve, Pablo, Barry, Steven, Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and will will participate in the Q&A.\n\nI would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially.\n\nI encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. I will now hand the call over to Herve.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you Ben and good morning everyone.\n\nIn the third quarter, we continued to deliver double digit revenue growth important successes in pricing on the reimbursement and continued progress of the pipeline.\n\nProduct and royalty revenues were 914 million in the quarter, with an 11% growth year over year diven by JAKAFI.and OPZELURA. .\n\nJAKAFI net sales for the quarter were impacted by inventory valuation, which Christiana will detail in her prepared remarks.\n\nAs you see, in the first nine months, JAKAFI growth continues at a rate of around 8% this year. The gross trajectory of Opzelura continued into the third quarter with net product revenue of $92 million driven by both new patients and retailed [inaudible] and Vitiligo.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2023, OPZELURA revenues contributed 229 million and we expect OPZELURA to continue to be a key contributor to the growth of Incyte into next year.\n\nOn slide six, we made important progress this quarter on two fronts related to pricing and access. First, as IR already implemented we secured small biotech exception status for [inaudible]. This has two impacts on JAKAFI pricing and gross to net in the coming years. One, we expect that JAKAFI will be exempt from negotiation until 2029, making it the facto neutral to our initial business plan. And two, as you can see, we expect to benefit from the specified small manufacturer phasing schedule profile [inaudible] catastrophic coverage [inaudible] start up benefits, which will have a meaningful impact in the years 2025 to 2031.\n\nFor OPZELURA, our coverage in the US starting in 2024, OPZELURA will be listed as a preferred brand on the CVS Caremark and [inaudible] formularies which would benefit roughly 30 million commercial lives. This achievement will move OPZELURA to preferred brand from non-preferred brand here and will result in increased access by reducing both the pellet requirements, patient co pay for many patients while maintaining OPZELURA's federal about utilization management criteria.\n\nTurning to slide seven. We continue to make progress in our clinical development across our portfolio. Just last week, we obtained new top line results from the phase two randomized study assessing the efficacy and safety of [inaudible] our JAK one inhibitor in patients with [inaudible]. The study met its primary endpoint across all three treatment dose groups and [inaudible] was generally well tolerated.\n\nThere are approximately 100,000 treated patients in the US with [inaudible] with limited treatment options and we are excited to move this program for a while based on the phase two data. Steven will provide additional details.\n\nDuring the quarter, we had a significant presence at [inaudible] where we presented the full OPZELURA atopic dermatitis in the pediatric population and positive long term extension data in Vitiligo. We also shared new positive data from the phase IIB clinical trial of [inaudible] in adults with extensive vitiligo.\n\nBy the end of the year, we anticipate providing additional data from Ozaki program, including an update on our oral PDL one program. Additional combination data of [inaudible] plus [inaudible] and full disclosure of our novel preclinical program targeting subject to B617F mutation, which has the potential to be a disease modifying therapy for many patients with [inaudible] neoplasms.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Barry who will discuss our commercial performance in more detail. \n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you Herve and good morning everyone.\n\nStarting with JAKAFI on slide nine. JAKAFI continued to experience increasing patient demand during the quarter as we delivered 2023 year-to-date net sales of $1.9 billion, growing 8% year over year, while total patients for the first nine months has also grown 8% year over year across all indications.\n\nThe quarter over quarter impact in net sales is primarily attributable to fluctuations in channel inventory. Recall that we reported exiting Q2 at the high end of our normal inventory range and inventory drew down modestly in Q3.\n\nWe continue to see strong growth in underlying demand and now are tightening our full year 2023 guidance to a new range of $2.59 billion the $2.62 billion.\n\nAs we look to the future for JAKAFI, PV will be a key growth driver, particularly considering that a significant portion of patients are not receiving adequate benefit with hydroxyurea.\n\nNow for the first time, we have data that clearly demonstrates the thrombosis free survival benefit that can be achieved with JAKAFI. The data shows that patients who are not being adequately controlled and are switched to JAKAFI experience a 44% reduction in the risk of major thrombosis.\n\nWe're already hearing from thought leaders that this data is game changing in PV and reinforces the importance of early intervention for these patients. We believe this important data will help drive earlier use, allowing us to further penetrate the PV market.\n\nTurning to OPZELURA on Slide 11, the launch continues to be strong and is gaining positive momentum with both physicians and patients as we established OPZELURA as one of the best recent dermatology launches.\n\nLooking at the first two years post FDA approval OPZELURA outperforms all other dermatology products on a launch aligned basis. The rapid adoption of OPZELURA is driven by its compelling product profile and its ability to address significant unmet need in both atopic dermatitis and  vitiligo.\n\nOPZELURA net product revenues in the quarter were $92 million, up 141% when compared to the same quarter last year. US patient demand increased during the quarter with total prescriptions growing 72% year over year, and refills growing by 19% versus the prior quarter with over 9,100 dermatologists now having prescribed OPZELURA.\n\nThe weekly prescription trend, as shown on the right, demonstrates the continued growth of OPZELURA, which is coming from both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. In AD, growth was primarily due to new patient flow driven by OPZELURA's efficacy and impact on inflammation and itch.\n\nIn Vitiligo where OPZELURA is the only approved treatment for re-pigmentation, growth was driven largely by refills and our educational and awareness initiatives. We remain very optimistic about the long term potential of OPZELURA as we continue to see the strong uptake and positive momentum.\n\nWe are also working to drive new patient growth and adherence through ongoing initiatives. During the quarter, we kicked off a new marketing campaign called Moments of Clarity featuring Mandy Moore. The goal of this campaign is intended to bring to life the stories of real people struggling with eczema, who found relief by talking to their dermatologist and to build broad awareness of OPZELURA as a nonsteroidal topical option among mild to moderate AD patients.\n\nThe campaign secured several high profile media placements, including coverage with top tier outlets like the Today Show and People Magazine. We are also continuing to rollout DTC initiatives in vitiligo, which is building awareness, driving demand, and activating patients to discuss treatment options with their dermatologist.\n\nTurning to Slide 14, we continued to make advancements with our payer coverage for OPZELURA. In AD, payer adoption continues to improve with regional plans and as of today, we have roughly 84% commercial coverage for OPZELURA in atopic dermatitis covering over 127 million lives.\n\nIn vitiligo we have made significant progress since the launch and have improved our coverage by roughly 30% throughout 2023. The most recent progress was with Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal employee program, which accounts for over 5.5 million lives.\n\nAdditionally, as Herve mentioned, OPZELURA will be moving from non-preferred to preferred brand tier effective January 1st, 2024 for CVS, Caremark, and Aetna formularies. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pablo.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you Barry and good morning, everyone.\n\nAs you may recall, earlier this year, we made the decision to increase our focus on eight high potential programs. Consistently with this, our near term goals for the R&D organization, lead to increase in the rigor of our decision making, accelerate the progression of our pipeline and increase our efficiency to optimize our resource allocation. \n\nBefore I hand the call over to Steven for an update on some of our later stage programs, I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting some of our key earlier stage programs to give you a more clear picture of the depth and quality of our pipeline.\n\nDuring the third quarter, our TGF beta receptor two by PD-1 bispecific antibody entered the clinic and the phase one dose escalation study is progressing well. It has been designed with high selectivity from the PD-1 receptor, combined with TGF beta receptor 2 inhibition and it has the potential to enable a synergistic approach to target multiple immunosuppressive pathways across a number of cancers. \n\nINCA34460 is a novel humanized anti IL 15 receptor beta monoclonal antibody that is designed to target and deplete auto reactive tissue wrestling and memory T cells. It has demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for vitiligo in preclinical models and received IND clearance last quarter.\n\nWe have since initiated the phase one single dose ascending study. We have also dosed our first patients for the phase one study of our novel anti-mutant [inaudible] targeted monoclonal antibody, with a potential to eradicate the malignant clone in certain patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and significantly modify disease outcomes. [inaudible] mutations are responsible for disease development in approximately 25% to 35% of patients with MF and ET.\n\nWe're disclosing today for the first time, a program targeting the JAK2 V617 mutation, the most common somatic mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms. The JAK2 V617 mutation is located in the JH2 domain of the JAK2 receptor and is present in 55, 60, and 95% of patients with MF, EP and PV respectively.\n\nUnlike [inaudible] which inhibits both wild type and V6178 mutation positive cells, INCB 160058 selectively binds to the JAK2 JH2 site disrupting the V618 induced confirmation and thus, allowing selective inhibition of mutant activity in the JAK2 receptor whilst sparing wild type. We expect to file the IND by year end 2023 and enter into the clinic in 2024.\n\nTogether, we're an on time mutant call out program, there's two potentially disease modifying programs representing a fundamentally new approach to addressing MS, EP, and PV and solidify our leadership in MPNs.\n\nWith that, I would like to pass the call to Steven who will further highlight some of our key achievements this quarter with our more advanced programs. Steven?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you Pablo. Starting on Slide 19, as Herve mentioned, we obtained the topline results from the phase II randomized double blind placebo controlled dose ranging study assessing the efficacy and safety of [inaudible] in patients with Piragua and [inaudible].\n\nThe study met the primary endpoint for all [inaudible] doses studied for 15, 45, and 75 milligrams and at week 16, 36.1, 44.4, and 54.1% of patients respectively achieved the primary endpoint versus an 8.1% rate for patients on placebo. The primary endpoint was designed to assess the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to four point improvement in itch at week 16.\n\n[inaudible] was generally well tolerated across all doses and the safety analyses were consistent with previously presented data with no new reported treatment emergent adverse events.\n\nWe plan on presenting the full data set at an upcoming medical conference in the first half of 2024. As a result of these very encouraging findings, plans are underway to initiate a phase III study in 2024.\n\nWe had a significant presence at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress earlier this month, which highlighted our commitment to the atopic dermatitis and vitiligo communities.\n\nIn a late break in oral presentation, we presented positive 52-week data from a phase 2B clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of [inaudible] in adult patients with extensive non-segmental vitiligo.  These results showed that treatment with oral [inaudible] was associated with substantial total body and facial re-pigmentation across all treatment groups at week 52 and was well tolerated at all doses throughout the study.\n\nDuring the 24-week post treatment period, total body and facial re-pigmentation was also maintained, which suggest durability of response following treatment discontinuation. These data further reinforced the efficacy and safety profile of [inaudible] as an oral treatment for patients with extensive non-segmental vitiligo and we plan to initiate the phase III study by the end of this calendar year.\n\n[inaudible] has already demonstrated outstanding efficacy in the phase II program in [inaudible]. As a reminder, 52% to 56% of patients treated with [inaudible] achieved [inaudible] at week 16 with responses improving to 59% to 67% in week 52.\n\nAdditionally, [inaudible] 100 response, which is complete resolution of all manifestations of the disease was reported at week 52 in up to 29% of patients.\n\nThe two phase III studies Stop HS1 and Stop HS2 are enrolling very well and this reflects the strong phase II data presented earlier this year.\n\nWe continue to expand the [inaudible] program focused on the science, while leveraging our extensive dermatology capabilities. We look forward to advancing the development of [inaudible] in areas of unmet need where it is currently being evaluated in two phase III studies in HS and moving into a phase III program for vitiligo and [inaudible]. Work continues in the phase II proof of concept studies in asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nMoving to [inaudible] cream on slide 23, also presented at the ADV with expanded results from the pivotal phase III true AD3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of [inaudible] cream in children, two to 12 years old with atopic dermatitis.\n\nThese data showed significantly more patients treated with [inaudible] 0.75% and 1.5% achieved investigator's global assessment treatment success in patients treated with placebo. Treatment with [inaudible] cream over eight weeks under maximum use conditions was also well tolerated in children.\n\nExpert feedback on the data has been consistently positive, namely that [inaudible] cream could be advantageous to the currently available nonsteroidal topical options and an important option before resorting to currently available injectables. We are excited about the potential relief [inaudible] cream can bring to the over 2 million pediatric atopic dermatitis patients in the United States.\n\nAs a late break in oral presentation at the ADV, new results from the pooled analysis of the long term extension data from the pivotal phase III true V program we presented, the long term study extension evaluate OPZELURA in patients 12 years and older with non-segmental vitiligo, who previously experienced limited or no response to treatment at week 24.\n\nThe data demonstrated that prolonged treatment cream led to increased facial and total body re pigmentation in those patients who were initial non responders. Approximately 70% of patients saw improvements in facial [inaudible] and total [inaudible] at week, 52, which increased to 85% by week 104.\n\nThroughout the long term extension, OPZELURA continued to be well tolerated with no serious treatment related adverse events. This data highlights the importance of prolonged treatment in patients with vitiligo, even when limited or no repigmentation is achieved in the first six months of treatment.\n\nOn Slide 25, we continue to advance OPZELURA development beyond AD and vitiligo and into other indications where it has the potential to provide significant value as either the first approved therapy or first approved topical therapy for patients living with these dermatologic conditions.\n\nWe currently have three phase II studies, which have recently completed enrollment in like in [inaudible] sclerosis, and mild to moderate HS. And two additional phase III trials evaluating [inaudible] which are all currently enrolling patients.\n\nFinally on Slide 26, we have a number of upcoming data readouts and other exciting milestones expected and we look forward to sharing additional details throughout the remainder of this year.\n\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update. \n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you Stephen and good morning everyone.\n\nQ3 total product revenues were $783 million, representing a 10% year over year increase. In the first nine months of 2023, total product revenues were $2.3 billion, representing a 16% year over year increase. Total royalty revenues, which are primarily comprised of royalties from Novartis for JAKAFI [inaudible] and royalties from Lilly for ILUVIEN were $131 million in the third quarter and $374 million in the first nine months of the year.\n\nTurning to JAKAFI, JAKAFI net product revenues were $636 million for the third quarter and $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023. \n\nIn the first nine months of the year, JAKAFI net sales grew 8% compared to the same period last year.\n\nWhile JAKAFI demand net sales have continued to steadily increase quarter over quarter, in the first two quarters of 2023, we saw more notable fluctuations in channel inventory levels, which resulted in some variability in the quarterly reported net sales.\n\nAs we had previously said at the end of Q1, channel inventory levels fell below the low end of the normal range recovering in Q2, and ending the second quarter towards the high end of the normal range.\n\nAt the end of Q3, channel inventory levels returned to the midpoint of the normal range.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the decrease in inventory had a $14 million negative impact on reported net sales.\n\nTurning now to OPZELURA, net product revenues for the third quarter were $92 million, representing 141% increase year over year, driven by increased patient demand and expanded coverage.\n\nIn the first nine months of the year, total OPZELURA net product revenues were $229 million.\n\nMoving on to Slide 32, and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis, total R&D expenses were $376 million for the third quarter, representing a 2% year over year decrease driven primarily by the decrease in one-time collaboration related expenses, partially offset by continued investment in our late stage development assets and timing of certain expenses.\n\nTotal SG&A expenses were $268 million for the third quarter, representing a 1% year over year growth.\n\nMoving onto our guidance for 2023, we're tightening our guidance range for JAKAFI to a new range of $2.59 to $2.62 billion. We are re-affirming our other dermatology oncology revenue, [inaudible] R&D and SG&A guidance for the year.\n\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks, please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.\n\nOne moment please while we poll for questions. Our first question today is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nGood morning. This is [inaudible] on for Salveen, thank you for taking our question. First, could you help us understand OPZELURA gross to net trends during the quarter and your expectations on the forward? And then just a quick question on the combo data with JAKAFI, [inaudible] that's expected in 4Q, I guess in the context of the once-a-day dosing stance and the overall combination strategy and the positioning of each asset, can you just help us understand your thinking on how this could play out from a lifecycle management standpoint? Thank you.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nHi, [inaudible], it's Christiana. I'll take the first part of your question and then turn it to Steven. Regarding the gross to net for OPZELURA in Q3 gross to net was 54%, down from 55% in Q2 and 60% in Q1. As we said in our prior call, in last quarter's call, we expect gross to net to continue around that 55% level and then improvement would very much depend on the evolution of Medicaid. \n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nAnd then in terms of your second question in the lifecycle management of [inaudible] in myeloproliferative neoplasms and beyond including graft versus host disease, just to take the components of your question separately, the once daily dosing, we continue to work with the FDA on a response, and one of the efforts involves modeling that may be a little short in terms of timeline and one may require some further work. Regardless of the effort we undertake, both will be delivered way before the LOE for [inaudible] so that we will pursue and continue.\n\nIn terms of [inaudible] both very important combinations, we're showing further monotherapy and combination data at the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December so you'll have to wait for those abstracts and the meeting itself to see the data, but it's more data in terms of monotherapy and combination. Your question relates to how they may play out. [inaudible] is principally addressing [inaudible] inhibition and then resulting in hemoglobin improvement. And the idea there would be to treat both the anemia from out of fibrosis as well as potentially the dragging induced anemia from [inaudible] and we'll see how that data evolves.\n\nThat is already a mechanism that has demonstrated the ability to shrink spleen, spleen volume reduction to improve symptoms and also through epigenetic means improve hemoglobin. And we've already shown quite substantial efficacy with our own program. We will see how other competitors' programs play out in the short term. We will show you data at ASH and then we will direct you towards our registration directed efforts here. It could be plays in the first line setting in combination with rux in the sub optimal setting in combination with rux and even as monotherapy post JAK inhibitors, there's substantial efficacy with the bed program.\n\nAnd then just to round out, let me remind you [inaudible] a positive phase III this year with really excellent data in third line graph versus host disease and that submission is going in and we will progress that through the regulatory cycle. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nTazeen Ahmad\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGood morning, and thank you so much for taking my question. Just one for me, I'm trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the evolution of the competitive landscape as it relates to JAKAFI. There has been a recent new approval [inaudible] for a subset of patients that might be on JAKAFI. How are you thinking about marketing JAKAFI in relation to this newly approved drug and do you think that there's any risk of that drug taking market share? Thanks.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure Tazeen, this is Barry. So as we think about competition in myelofibrosis, there was already two other JAK inhibitors on the market and neither of those JAK inhibitors have really penetrated and their approvals have actually been in the first and second line setting and haven't really moved at all over many quarters now in terms of their market share or quite frankly in terms of their net sales.\n\n[inaudible] itself, JAKAFI was compared directly in simplify one study to [inaudible] and [inaudible] in that study. The approval that they received both in the first line and second line setting for patients with anemia, JAKAFI is in fact, the only drug that really has superior overall survival in myelofibrosis patients regardless of anemia. So in other words, patients who have anemia and got JAKAFI for myelofibrosis have a survival advantage. So that strong designation gives us confidence that we'll continue to be the leader in myelofibrosis. \n\nAdditionally, of course, myelofibrosis patients are mostly started on therapy when they have symptoms and JAKAFI clearly is the most effective therapy when it comes to managing symptoms and spleen. And then [inaudible] just like the other drugs are in fact much more costly than JAKAFI, [inaudible] being a $26,900 per month, 60% or so higher than JAKAFI. So it seems like it was priced for a second line drug and we think that's where it'll be mostly used.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, that's star one to be placed in the question queue. And we ask you please ask one question the return to the queue. Our next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC capital markets. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHey, thanks. It's [inaudible] on for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to go back to maybe some of the reimbursement dynamics with OPZELURA. You guys mentioned the preferred brand designation from Caremark and [inaudible], I guess I'm curious how do you anticipate that impacting access and ultimately pulling through the utilization and did you guys have to make any net pricing concessions for that? And I guess related to that, I mean is this contracting that you're working on with some of the other payers as well? Thanks.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure [inaudible], Barry again. So in terms of Caremark, CVS, Caremark in particular, it is very important in terms of access for the patients. We're trying to make it as easy as possible for dermatologists to prescribe the drug and then for patients to receive it. So in this particular situation, we're going from a double step for atopic dermatitis, so patients would have had to go through topical steroids and topical callison urine inhibitors are before they get to OPZELURA and in vitiligo it also had to go through multiple steps. Now in vitiligo as it should be because of the label and the only drug approved for vitiligo that pigments the skin for vitiligo, having no steps to go through so first line therapy is excellent and just having to go through one step because most patients will have in fact use topical steroids when they have AD, so that makes it much easier.\n\nIn terms of contracting of concessions, there's always a negotiation of course with the BEMs and the pairs over rebates and fees and so forth. So it might cost us a little bit more on the rebate but in fact then the co pays generally go down. And most importantly, what we're really trying to achieve is volume. And then I suppose your last question is the negotiations with the payers always continues. We don't really have to have any further negotiations unless we choose to until 2025 for OPZELURA, but there's always the chance that we'd come back and decide to do something slightly different in terms of making access easier for patients. Most of the contracts that we have in place currently in fact allow plans to step up and change their step therapy from two to one and so forth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from David Lebowitz from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Neil Lebowitz\n\nAnalyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. Would you be able to give us insight on the current rate of the number of tubes per patient in AD [inaudible] and vitiligo you were expecting or have there been any changes in expectations and where things stand right now?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure. So in terms of AD, I think we had it on the slide, it's around two. We've been saying that for a while. We expect to two tubes for patients for our atopic dermatitis on average. Obviously some patients will get a lot more than that. And vitiligo we need some more time really to evaluate exactly in the real world how patients will receive OPZELURA for vitiligo. So patients who have might just apply the drug to the face for example or apply it all over their body, it varies but we'll continue to track the number of tubes for vitiligo, but obviously with our data so far, long term extension data patient can use it safely for years and continue to get benefits. So we will update you when we have more information as we gather more data as we have more use in vitiligo.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Jessica Fye from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\n\nJessica Macomber Fye\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you'll be in a position to provide OPZELURA sales guidance for 2024? And with respect to your bet, what you'll be looking for in the upcoming [inaudible]?\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo Jessica, I'll take the first part of the question regarding the OPZELURA guidance. We chatted with you in the past that in order to provide guidance, we want to have a few quarters of real world experience with OPZELURA especially for vitiligo given that it is a new market and be able to see how in the real world utilization how many tubes on average vitiligo patients use and also how quickly and at what rate inactive patients and get in to see their physicians and get on therapy. So we're still very early in the launch of vitiligo and we'll continue to monitor the progress and want to say a few more quarters before we are in a position to provide guidance.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nAnd then in terms of your question related to bet inhibition in myelofibrosis, the competitor ongoing first line study, which you alluded to is what we consider a pretty standard first line study in about 440 patients. The primary endpoint is spleen volume reduction of 35% or greater and already communicated it has to be an end in terms of the secondary endpoint of hitting total symptom score, 50% improvement or above versus the competitor [inaudible] in that situation.\n\nFor our own bet inhibitor, as I said earlier, both monotherapy data we've already shown in spleen reduction symptom responses, hemoglobin responses, and then the ongoing combo work showing the same. And we'll have to see how that data plays out versus what the competitor delivers in that first line study in terms of our registration efforts and we'll communicate further about that at the ASH meeting coming up in December. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Mark [inaudible] from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first to start on the commercial side to follow up on one of the prior questions, Barry on a blended basis given this is a pretty large plan that you're moving up the formulary but on a blended overall basis where [inaudible] we expect gross to net to be incrementally increased in '24 versus the full year '23 given that move?\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nMark, I'm not really sure to be honest with you. We'll have to see what the volume is and what the improvement in co pays is to see how it affects our gross to net. But yeah anyway, we'll see but there's always a chance that we could actually benefit a great deal from net sales by making it much easier for patients to be able to access our drug.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from [inaudible] from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nGood morning. This is [inaudible]. We have two questions for [inaudible]. Due to the recent approval for GSK [inaudible] the first one is what portion on patients using JAKAFI do you estimate are using at the optimal dose due to anaemia? And in this patient population have you seen an increased rate of discontinuation as prescribers and patients potentially move towards [inaudible]? And secondly, have you observed a decrease in JAKAFI in new patient [inaudible] was approved? Thank you.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nThe most important thing is that [inaudible] got approved on September 15th. It really only launched in the last week of the year. I'd be surprised if there was actually any sales except for stocking sales in the quarter. So anyway, so I can't imagine that it affected any part of us yet. Now what percent of patients might be receiving a suboptimal dose, what we've only said before I believe is that the number of patients who are at a steady state on a five milligrams twice a day dose or something like that is only about 5% of our patients. I believe those patients are actually getting benefit but that's the most and just like in our clinical trials, cover one trial, I mean, only one patient discontinued for anemia. So we don't believe that that's a big part of it. And like I said before about the benefits that JAKAFI provides to MF patients whether they are anemic or non anemic, it's overall survival, it's symptom control, it's spleen control. So far we don't really anticipate an impact [inaudible] certainly in the third quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Your line is now live.\n\nMatthew Christopher Phipps\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division\n\nThanks for taking my question. I'm wondering on the [inaudible] phase III plans on vitiligo how you can structure that trial to complement the current OPZELURA utilization opportunities, is it really just around baseline Bassi scores? And then as you think further out about additional opportunities for [inaudible] what are you keeping in mind considering it looks based on the profile so far to work in a pretty wide range of more classical autoimmune indications [inaudible]?\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nMatt, hi. It's Steven, thanks for the question. So in terms of vitiligo, as we showed you the data in more extensive non-segmental vitiligo we saw a really good effect in terms of facial [inaudible] E, facial [inaudible] 75 and above and then total [inaudible] as well body rate pigmentation of 50% or above. We will disclose when we go onto clintrials.gov what the endpoints are and what doses we'll be using so it's premature to point you towards that other than just broadly tell you that the population we are targeting is people with more extensive body surface area involvement \n\nand then when you compare it to the cream, which is indicated for people with 10% or below this would open up the vitiligo community to people with much more extensive body surface area involvement where it becomes a little pragmatically hard to apply cream across the body and an oral JAK can be used in that setting with the right therapeutic ratio. And as we guided to, we want to get this study going by the end of this calendar year. [inaudible] is relatively JAK one specific. You saw the program in HS1, HS2 is enrolling really, really well based on what we think is excellent phase II data, including [inaudible] 100 response, but as you allude to, we have now data in [inaudible] that's excellent and we want to progress that into phase III, and then ongoing efforts beyond dermatology in asthma, and chronic spontaneous urticaria, where the biology points to this kind of JAK one agent potentially showing substantial benefit in patients with more severe asthma, who on inhaled corticosteroids long acting bronchodilator and still having yearly exacerbations. That's a phase II proof of concept study and then standard endpoints in chronic spontaneous urticaria. So this drug has demonstrated thus far remarkable activity in those areas where we're studying in phase III now and we'll see what happens in asthma in CSU, so thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHey, good morning. This is Paul on for Michael. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to build on the prior question, can you talk about how you plan to position [inaudible] in the planned phase III relative to sort of how you designed the ongoing phase III studies for OPZELURA. Is there a meaningful difference in the target patient populations and how should we think about the specific addressable opportunities within the year for the two programs?\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nYeah, thank you for the question. Just so you know, in terms what Herve said upfront in his remarks, there's a prevalence upwards of 200,000 plus patients, but they're about 80,000 to 100,000 that currently get treated in this setting and their main manifestation of their disease is itch and very severe itch, and that's what the phase II showed, that activity in that setting across the dose ranges. I think it's premature beyond that to talk about the endpoint and the dose we'll be using because we've just got the phase II data in, but it will be again, because it's an oral agent targeting the more severe spectrum of the end; that's what I can tell you now. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Mara Goldstein from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nMara Goldstein\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just was hoping actually to get a little bit more color on the Medicaid penetration with respect to OPZELURA because last quarter it was identified as a jump in the payer mix that had an effect on OPZELURA and the gross net. And then secondarily, just hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about PV for JAKAFI, it looks like the percentage just eyeballing it right of JAKAFI sales from PV has remained relatively stable and I'm curious as to with this new data and potentially earlier patient starts where you think the growth could be?\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure. So as far as Medicaid patients on OPZELURA goes, it's about 14% of paid patients as we said in the past we had such good coverage for Medicaid throughout all 50 states that it sort of grew faster than perhaps the commercial patients, so I think that answers part of your question. For JAKAFI and PV, I guess if you were looking at the slide that we had there, PV in terms of the patient share, it's about 35% or so at any given time for example, this year, year-to-date there's more than 8,000 patients on PV, but PV patients stay on the drug for a long time. So we're talking about what we think now the average is about 41 months that patients are staying on JAKAFI for PV. So that's important for every new PV patient that becomes more important and we think that there's lots of patients who are currently on other therapies, including hydroxyurea that would benefit from moving to JAKAFI earlier, and now that we have a study where there was no crossover so that you can actually evaluate the long term thrombosis free survival and in fact progression free survival for patients that that's really an indicator that you really should start earlier with an effective therapy like JAKAFI and we think that's really where the upside is here is that each and every PD patient is valuable and we can provide them with really effective therapy to manage their disease long term. So that's what our growth expectations are. Thanks. \n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question today is coming from Andrew Berens from SPV Securities. Your line is in our live.\n\nAndrew Berens\n\nAnalyst, SVB Leerink LLC\n\nHi, thanks. Can you remind us how you see 33 fitting into the treatment paradigm relative to the JAK agents? And do you see the regulatory pathway leveraging surrogate endpoints for approval or would you want to show a decrease in malignant transformation [inaudible]? \n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nAndy were you are asking about--Steven, just to clarify your question about mutant Cal RMB 607 F in the future? We couldn't hear clearly the first part of your question.\n\nAndrew Berens\n\nAnalyst, SVB Leerink LLC\n\nYeah, I'm trying to understand how you see that fitting into the treatment paradigm relative to the JAK agents.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. So as Pablo said in his remarks, a remarkable effort from our research group to come up with compounds that now target new areas of biology. So in terms of of mutant CAL R it's about 25-30% of myelofibrosis and ET. That's a neo antigen that's expressed and the antibody targets that and could eradicate the code. So you could be talking about a very new treatment paradigm that's disease modifying or potentially in inverted commas curable if you eliminate the clone in those settings. Obviously, we're early in the clinic, we need to prove its safe and get there, but there's a lot of excitement and obviously you got a plenary at ASH last year because of that with the mutant CAL R antibody.\n\nIn terms of where it fits in, it won't be an agent that's in the way we think about spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement it could be as I said to be a little bit repetitive, eliminate the clone and sort of get rid of the disease if you will. The dame with V 617S target that many of pursuit for a long time and again credit to our research group for coming up with as Pablo pointed out a very novel way of targeting the mutation in the JH2 domain and then again the idea would be to eliminate the clone in disease modifier and this is a bigger population. It's about 50% of MS, 60% of ET, and 95% plus of Polycythemia Vera. So for the first time now we've been able to show you that you can come up with a targeting PV, where it's an area where we haven't been able yet to give you anything new beyond [inaudible] so we're very excited about that. Again, it's early, we have to get the R&D across the finish line and get into the clinic, but it's a superb science and would be a very different way of thinking about those entities. So thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, this is Shawn online for Jay. Thanks for taking the question. So just to follow up on the [inaudible] question just [inaudible] I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the monotherapy versus combination approach going forward? On this slide it feels like the [inaudible] mutations are mutually exclusive so just want to confirm that that's correct. And just a quick question on OPZELURA, I'm wondering if you can talk about the split between AD and vitiligo, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nPablo J. Cagnoni\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nSo this is Pablo, let me take the first part of the question. So as Steven mentioned and I explained in my remarks, it's early days for both programs. I think that when you start thinking about how to position them and the potential combination with JAKAFI, I think we need to get through a few cohorts in the phase one studies, understand the profile of these two new medicines and then we'll start building a combination strategy. I think potentially that could be the case, particularly just thinking about symptom resolution with JAKAFI early in the treatment paradigm and then using either V617S or the mutant CAL R antibody to then try to eliminate the clone and potentially transform the outcomes in these diseases.\n\nThe second part of your question I think was related to whether these are mutually exclusive and they are and that's actually an important point in understanding how to position them in the future. And then I think you had a question about AD, which I'll pass over to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nYeah, I didn't really hear you. So AD versus vitiligo what were you trying to say whether there's a split volume?\n\nUnknown\n\nYeah, the split between AD and vitiligo. Thank you. \n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nSure, currently it's about 60, 40, so 60 AD, 40% vitiligo.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Ren Benjamin from JMP Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nRen Benjamin\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Steven, can you talk a little bit about how you view the competitive landscape in PN and HS and could the landscape change prior to your phase III readouts or are you the clear sort of market leader in both indications?\n\nAnd I guess just as a follow up question, maybe for Herve, you guys are generating significant cash flow, you have a strong balance sheet, the pipelines largely ignored by investors and is significantly down. Can you talk maybe a little bit about the process that you might be going through to maybe switch gears, maybe acquire an entire company platform and pipeline in all versus striking kind of one off product collaboration agreements?\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nSo I'll start and then hand it over to Steven. Let me remind you that [inaudible] is an oral agent. Both entities, you're talking about are becoming very interesting in terms of the science a lot of targeting with different modalities, but they're mostly intravenous IV large molecules that target things like IL 17, so very specific biology, whereas in these entities, there's more broad biology, and that's why we think JAK may be important here both in PN and HS as an oral agent. Now we've shown what we think is very strong proof of concept data in both entities, HS we have ongoing two phase threes and PN will be preceding it. Sure, the landscape can always change as part of any assessment we do, we look at the competitive landscape and what may occur. But in terms of an oral agent, we think that that's the big differentiator here and then I'll hand it over for the second part of your question.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSo your question about the way how we're sort of turning into a new direction regarding the use of cash, and the answer is we are still continuing to look at opportunities outside of the company, we are still investing in our pipeline, but as you have noticed our growth of the revenue continues to be faster, higher than the growth of our expenses, so we continue to generate leverage and we continue to have an increasing cash flow quarter after quarter and we are looking at opportunities to continue to add to the growth of the corporation in the year '25 to '30 so it's a relatively broad target. Obviously valuations have been frustrating a lot in the past months and it's creating opportunities that we are looking at so there is a clear willingness for the right price to add new products that would be fitting with our portfolio, if we can. We could do it through partnership or acquisition, in fact, we think both would be appropriate and it's a financial question, it's a question of willingness to go one route or the other but we could do it either way.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Derek Archila from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nGood morning. This is [inaudible] on for Derek. Thanks for taking our question. A quick one from us, can you provide some color on the pace of the pipeline development and whether it will be timely enough to [inaudible] loss of exclusivity?\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.",
    "content2": "So thanks for the question. Absolutely that's the case, so I'll be a little repetitive. The XR program, we were busy in terms of response to the FDA now and the idea is to get the XR approval prior to the loss of the LOE for Rux. Both [inaudible] programs we want to declare where we go and if we go into registration studies end of this year early part of next year and that'll give us enough time to execute our phase III program and get across the finish line there, so that's absolutely the intent. The mutant CAL R and V617F, as Pablo said, are early but with great promise disease modifying agents and so it's a little unclear the regulatory path there, and it'll depend on demonstrating safety and efficacy, but we will see if that keeps going well, you could potentially execute a rapid phase III program, but it's really too early to say.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nMaybe I can add, I mean on this view about the JAKAFI on the configuration and the way we have thought of allocating resources, that's basically the eight program. You saw one of the slides speaking about the eight programs that we are prioritizing in R&D and that's where you have the list of the programs that will be impacting our revenue in the years that are coming relatively soon with CAL R being maybe the one that is a little bit of  a stretch, but for everything else it could come before that time. And the [inaudible] program, which is increasing today, we had the news of an additional indication in [inaudible] is in phase three now for one indication. It says phase III is being planned for [inaudible] and vitiligo so all of that should be coming into [inaudible].\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, [inaudible] on for Evan. Just wanted to ask with the pre-submission meeting the FDA planned for pediatric patients, are there any nuances with that submission in the pediatric population versus adults that you think will require special consideration for the FDA and Incyte? And has there been any indication on when that may take place? Thank you.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nSteven, so we don't guide to when we have the actual meetings, but the only nuance in peds is some safety requirements to demonstrate under maximum use conditions that there's no increased levels or untoward side effects. We've completed that work, we're satisfied with the results and we're discussing with the FDA. So that will put our submission sometime hopefully in the first half of next year in terms of having a complete data set and submitting it then and we're very comfortable with the data. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.\n\nBen Strain\n\nAssociate Director, Investor Relations, Biogen, Inc.\n\nThank you all for participating on today's call and for your questions. The IR team will be available for the rest of the day. Please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Scherzer, Investor Relations for Incyte. Please go ahead, Greg.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are Herve, Pablo, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and participate in the Q&A. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC. We will now begin the call with Herve.\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. So we had another quarter of strong performance with product revenues growing 25% year-over-year, driven by Jakafi, Opzelura and launches in Europe. Jakafi net product revenue grew 14% compared to the second quarter of 2022. For Opzelura, the growth trajectory continues with net product revenues in the second quarter of $80 million driven by new patient flow and growth in refill. Additionally, the launch in Europe is underway and Opzelura is now available to patients in Germany and Austria. Our other hematology and oncology net product revenues were $64 million for the quarter, up 30% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Pemazyre and Minjuvi in ex U.S. markets. Now turning to Slide 5. We continue to execute on our development efforts. Recently, we announced positive top line results from 2 of our high potential program. The [indiscernible] study evaluating Ruxolitinib cream in pediatric atopic dermatitis and the AGAVE-201 study evaluating axatilimab in chronic GVHD, met their respective primary endpoint. .\nStephen will discuss these results in more detail during his prepared remarks as well as provide updates on the important progress we made across many of our high potential programs as shown at the bottom of the slide. We also strengthened our research and development organization by appointing Pablo Cagnoni as President and Head of R&D; and in this position and as a member of the executive team, Pablo will lead inside R&D activities. This new role aligns chemistry, biology and early and late-stage clinical development with the goal of maximizing feeds and productivity in our research and development efforts. I will now turn the call over to Pablo for a few words.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Herve. I'm thrilled to join the team at Incyte. A company with such an impressive history of success and who has refined -- redefined as standard of care in myeloproliferative neoplasm, graft versus host disease and vitiligo. Since joining just a few weeks ago, I have spent time with our teams, and I'm even more enthusiastic about the capabilities of our organization and about the quality of our science. We're prosecuting a broad range of biology with a diversity of modalities and I look forward to working with them to continue to deliver major advances across our portfolio in order to make a meaningful difference for patients. Herve?\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Pablo. And with that, I would like to pass the call to Barry for a commercial update.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you, Herve. Good morning, everyone. Starting with Jakafi on Slide 7. Net product revenues for the quarter were $682 million, up 14% year-over-year driven by the continued growth in patient demand across all indications. Total patient demand grew 5% year-over-year by new patient starts, a good indicator for future growth, was up 9% year-over-year. Given the strong underlying demand for Jakafi, we are raising the bottom end of our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a new range of $2.58 billion to $2.63 billion. Turning to Opzelura on Slide 8. The launch continues to be strong and is gaining positive momentum with both physicians and patients. The rapid adoption of Opzelura is driven by its compelling product profile and its ability to address significant unmet need in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. Opzelura net product revenues in the quarter were $80 million, up 42% compared to the prior quarter. .\nU.S. patient demand increased during the quarter with total prescriptions growing 16% compared to the last quarter and refills growing by 23%. The monthly prescription trend, as shown on the right, demonstrates the continued growth of Opzelura, which is coming from both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. In AD, growth was primarily due to new patient flow driven by Opzelura's efficacy and impact on inflammation and itch. In Gligo, where Opzelura is the only approved treatment for repigmentation. Growth was driven largely by refills and our educational and awareness initiatives. We are very optimistic about the long-term potential of Opzelura as we continue to see the strong uptake and positive momentum.\nOn Slide 9, Monjuvi net product revenue in the U.S. for the quarter were $24 million, up 2% year-over-year and were driven by continued growth in community accounts. Minjuvi Net product revenues outside of the U.S. were $13 million, up 198% year-over-year and includes $6 million of previously deferred revenue related to the early access program in France, which ended in June. Pemazyre net product revenue grew to $22 million, a 14% increase year-over-year with $5 million coming from outside the U.S. where the launches ongoing in 10 key markets in Europe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you, Barry. Starting on Slide 11. As Herve mentioned, we have 2 exciting program update we want to highlight from this quarter. First, for ruxolitinib cream. The primary endpoint was met in the Phase III TRuE-AD3 trial in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients aged 2 to 12. The top line results showed that significantly more patients achieved Investigator Global Assessment treatment Score, or IGA-TS with ruxolitinib cream .75% and 1.5% and with the vehicle control. No new safety signals were observed, and the overall safety profile is consistent with previously reported data. The long-term safety portion of the trial is ongoing and data will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific media. We also plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies, and we anticipate a submission in the first quarter 2024.\nWe are excited about the potential relief ruxolitinib cream can bring to the roughly 2 million pediatric atopic dermatitis patients in the United States. Moving to Slide 12. In partnership with Syndax, the AGAVE-201 study, a global pivotal trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with chronic graft versus host disease after 2 or more prior therapies, met its primary endpoint of overall response rate across all 3 treatment cohorts, with the 0.3 milligram per kilogram every 2-week dose achieving a 74% overall response rate. In the 0.3 milligram per kilogram cohort, 60% of responders maintained their response at 1 year and 55% of patients achieved at least a 7-point decrease in the modified lease symptom scale indicating that responses were both durable and with symptom improvements. Axatilimab was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were consistent with on-target effects.\nThe full data set is planned for presentation at a scientific meeting later this year with a potential BLA submission by year-end 2023. We are excited about the potential of axatilamab in chronic graft versus host disease and in this heavily pretreated and severe patient population. A Phase I/II trial of axatilimab in combination with ruxolitinib is also being planned. Moving to Slide 13. An updates on our broader dermatology pipeline. For Opzelura, in addition to the positive top line pediatric AD data, 3 Phase II studies for lichen planus, lichen sclerosus and hidradenitis suppurativa have completed enrollment. For povorcitinib, the Phase II study in prurigo nodularis has completed enrollment, and we expect to have data in this indication later this year. Additionally, we previously announced the expansion of povorcitinib development into inflammatory and autoimmune diseases beyond dermatology and now have initiated 2 Phase II trials in asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria, CSU.\nOn Slide 14, I want to provide a little more detail on our studies in asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease with 2 endotypes. Type 2 eosinophilic asthma, the most common type is primarily driven by Th2 cytokines, whereas non-type 2 asthma is characterized by a neutrophilic response. Many asthma patients have disease progression despite therapy with inhalers. Povorcitinib appears to have efficacy in both type 2 and non-type 2 endotypes. In preclinical data, povorcitinib results in a reduction of eosinophil activation and may potentially reduce neutrophil activation as well. The Phase II study is being evaluated in moderate to severe uncontrolled type 2 and non-type 2 asthmatic patients. Unlike monoclonal antibodies that target a single cytokine, povorcitinib inhibits the actions of multiple cytokines, potentially providing superior efficacy in both endotypes.\nCSU is a mast-cell driven disease, presented with hives and severe chronic itch. Overactivation of dermal mast cell and vasal results in increased serum levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17-related cytokines. We know JAK1 can modulate mast cell activation, including degranulation and cytokine production both of which are drivers of chronic spontaneous urticaria. The Phase II study has been evaluated in patients who are inadequately controlled or progress on second-generation antihistamines. Moving to hematology and oncology. We achieved multiple clinical milestones across our high potential portfolio during the second quarter. We continue to make progress in [indiscernible] where we presented updated clinical data by ALK2 and BET program. We also initiated the Phase I study of INCA33989, our mutant CALR antibody. And as previously discussed, axatilimab met the primary endpoint in chronic graft versus host disease.\nFor oncology, both of the Phase III studies evaluating tafasitamab in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in relapsed or refractory follicular and marginal zone lymphoma awfully enrolled, and the small molecule Oral PD-L1 program continues to advance with multiple new studies initiated. Turning to Slide 16 and an update on our small molecule oral PD-L1 program. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed cancer treatment for patients. Despite the remarkable clinical benefits, intravenous formulations have disadvantages, and there is ample opportunity for innovation and improved outcomes in this space. As the first company to demonstrate clinical activity with an orally available PD-L1 targeted agent, we have a unique opportunity for differentiation. As an oral small molecule, INCB99280 has a short half-life, which can reduce the burden of managing immune-related toxicities and provides a switch-off option if needed, which may offer improved overall safety, especially when combined with other agents.\nAdditionally, the convenience of an at-home oral administration is often preferred by patients and they offer the potential for an improved quality of life. On the right, you can see the current studies of INCB99280. We've initiated monotherapy Phase II studies in both checkpoint inhibitor naive patients and in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We also initiated 2 Phase I/II combination studies with axitinib and ipilimumab, a third Phase I/II study in combination with adagrasib is in preparation. We also announced last night that in partnership with Replimune, we are starting a neoadjuvant study to evaluate [indiscernible] in combination with RP1, a tumor-derived oncolytic immunotherapy in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. RP1 is Replimune's lead oncolytic immunotherapy product and is based on a proprietary new strain of herpes simplex virus engineered for robust tumor selective replication and is genetically armed with a fusogenic protein and GM-CSF.\nRP1 has already demonstrated substantial activity in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. At ASCO, we presented data for zilugacirtib, our ALK2 inhibitor in patients with myelofibrosis. Initial data from 36 patients demonstrated early signs of clinical activity through hepcidin reduction and anemia response in monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib. Zilugacirtib was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile, allowing for continued dose escalation. We have added an additional treatment group in first-line JAK-naive myelofibrosis patients with anemia and we plan to have updated data later this year. Additional data presented at ASCO for our BET inhibitor, INCB57643 demonstrated improvements in spleen volume and symptoms in both the monotherapy arm and in combination with ruxolitinib. It was generally well tolerated with 2 dose-limiting toxicities observed in the higher 12-milligram once-daily monotherapy arm.\nWe believe we have an active compound with encouraging early data. Dose finding work is ongoing with 10 milligrams once-daily monotherapy as well as continued dose escalation in the combination arm. Turning to Slide 19. We continue to make progress in other development programs. During the quarter, INCA33890, a TGF-beta2 by PD-1 bispecific antibody entered the clinic and a Phase I study was initiated. Additionally, auremolimab, our anti-IL-15 receptor beta antibody received IND clearance and we plan for it to enter the clinic later this year. Retifanlimab, which was recently approved in Merkel cell carcinoma has completed enrollment in the Phase III non-small cell lung cancer study and in the squamous-cell anal carcinoma study. Finally, on Slide 20, we have a number of upcoming data readouts and other exciting milestones expected, and we look forward to sharing additional details throughout the remainder of this year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was a very strong quarter with total product revenues increasing 25% year-over-year to $827 million, driven by the strong performance of Jakafi and Opzelura. Jakafi net product revenues for the second quarter were $682 million, representing a 14% year-over-year increase driven primarily by continued growth in patient demand across all indications and an increase in channel inventory. At the end of Q2, channel inventory had recovered from the depressed Q1 levels and was towards the high end of the normal range. The increase in inventory represented around $35 million in net product revenues. Opzelura net product revenues for the second quarter were $80 million, representing a 384% increase year-over-year, driven by increased patient demand and expanded coverage. .\nFinally, other hematology oncology net product revenues were $64 million, representing a 30% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022 driven by patient demand and the recognition of $6 million of previously deferred Minjuvi revenue related to the early access program in France, which ended in June. Turning to royalty revenues. Total royalty revenues for the quarter were $128 million and are primarily comprised of royalties from Novartis of $90 million for Jakavi and $5 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $32 million for Olumiant. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were negatively impacted by FX headwinds.\nTurning now to Slide 24 and the performance of Opzelura. The launch of Opzelura has been very strongly with 2023 year-to-date net sales of $137 million. Since the launch of vitiligo, Opzelura net product revenues have grown at an average quarterly rate of 28%. Net product revenues grew 42% compared to last quarter, primarily driven by demand and the normalization of the typical Q1 dynamics. Moving on to Slide 25 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Total R&D expenses were $401 million for the second quarter, representing a 15% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by the progression of our pipeline including the expansion of the clinical development program, evaluating ruxolitinib cream in additional indications and the progression of povorcitinib into pivotal studies. The SG&A expenses were $284 million for the second quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by promotional activities launched at the beginning of the year to support Opzelura and Vitiligo and the timing of certain other expenses.\nMoving on to our guidance for 2023. As a result of Jakafi's strong demand growth, we are releasing again the bottom end of our full year Jakafi guidance to a new range of $2.58 billion to $2.63 billion. We are reaffirming our other hematology oncology revenue, COGS, R&D and the SG&A guidance for the year. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Christine.\n\nChristine Chiou\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are Herve, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and Dash, who will join us for the Q&A. .\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our reports filed with the SEC. We will now begin the call with Herve.\n\nHerve Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. So we'll be moving to Slide 4. And -- so in the first quarter, product revenue grew 14% year-over-year. The growth for the quarter does not fully reflect the strength of the underlying patient demand for Jakafi and Opzelura, which I will discuss in the next slide.\nIn hematology and oncology, the ongoing launches of Pemazyre and Minjuvi ex U.S. drove the 17% year-over-year growth. We also received additional approvals, including our first indication for in merkel cell carcinoma in the U.S. and more importantly, the approval of Opzelura for vitiligo in Europe with an excellent level.\nis available commercially in the U.S. and Opzelura will be launched in Europe in the next few months, starting with Germany.\nMoving to Slide 5. Taking a closer look at the Q1 dynamics that affected net sales in the quarter for Jakafi and Opzelura. Jakafi patient demand was strong across all indications, growing 7% on a year-on-year basis. On gross to net, we have the typical Q1 negative effect with higher deductions due to an increase in Medicare coverage, gap rebates and patient deductibles.\nWe also had an increase in purchases. Separately, channel inventory fell below normal level, resulting in an $11 million impact. Given the strong underlying patient demand, we are confident in our full year outlook and are raising the low end of our guidance to a new range of $2.55 billion to $2.63 billion for the full year.\nTurning to Opzelura. There are 3 components to fully understand the dynamics of the first quarter. First, we saw a continuation of strong trends in weekly prescription growth in the quarter. 60,000 new patients were treated with Opzelura.\nSecond, as you can see in the TRx graph on the right, refills were being pulled forward in December, and this resulted in lower volume in the first 2 months of the year. And third, net price in the quarter was impacted by an increase in commercial co-pay and the higher Medicaid utilization.\nSo the outlook is strong for both Jakafi and Opzelura as we expect to drive further growth throughout the year.\nMoving to Slide 6. With our R&D pipeline growing and advancing, we have recently decided to concentrate our resources behind the project with the highest potential to drive our revenue growth in the next few years. This 8 program of first or best-in-class candidates have large potential with multiple indications, such as Opzelura, parsaclisib and oral PD-1 or PD-L1 or alternatively, they address a significant unmet need in an existing franchise like the LIMBER program with ALK2, BET, axatilimab and CALA.\nWe are discontinuing 6 programs, including parsaclisib in MF and 1 autoimmune hemolytic anemia, [indiscernible] the adenosine program and GITR. This concentration of our internal and external resources will increase speed and efficiency for the 8 high potential programs and allow us to further accelerate our promising early clinical programs like CDK2, TGF-beta PD-1 bispecific and oremolimab. With that, I would like to pass the call to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive Vice President & General Manager-US, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. Turning with Jakafi on Slide 8. Patient demand for Jakafi was strong across all indications. New patient starts, which are a strong leading indicator for growth in future quarters grew 8% year-on-year to reach an all-time high.\nUnit demand, as shown by the chart on the bottom left, shows good growth in Q1 versus the past 2 years.\nTurning to Opzelura. Net sales in the quarter were $57 million. On the right, our total prescriptions as reported by IQVIA. Launch trends continue to be strong with robust growth seen in both March and April. As we continue to drive further awareness and adoption of the brand, the number of dermatologists gaining experience with Opzelura continues to increase.\nTurning to Slide 10. I want to take a step back and recognize the significant achievements we have been able to accomplish with the launch of Opzelura. When reflecting on the first 18 months of launch, Opzelura outperformed other brands prescribed by dermatologists on a launch-aligned basis. The rapid adoption of Opzelura highlights its compelling product profile and its ability to address significant unmet needs. In addition, we were able to secure payer access far quicker than any other recent launches in dermatology.\nLooking at Slide 11. So momentum with Opzelura is strong, and we are continuing to see very positive trends in terms of uptake, awareness and reception for the brand in Vitiligo. We launched our first TV direct-to-consumer campaign for vitiligo on February 12 this year, and early data supports the success we've had in just a few weeks.\nBased on a survey conducted of approximately 100 dermatologists, NPs and PAs, they indicated that nearly 20% of their vitiligo patients requested Opzelura and that 85% of those patients request are filled. This level of brand awareness and patient activation is substantially higher than almost every other product in dermatology offices. And with our continued efforts, we believe we can reactivate a significant percentage the diagnosed vitiligo patient population.\nTurning to Slide 12. Opzelura uptake in atopic dermatitis is driven by its efficacy and in particular, by the impact on itch. This is the clear differentiator for the brand, and Opzelura is the only topical therapy with itch reduction in its label.\nTo understand how quickly Opzelura can work in some patients, this past weekend, at the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis meeting, we presented data from our scratch AD study. Results showed that patients were able to attain substantial itch reduction as early as 15 minutes after the first application of Opzelura and peak reduction after 4 hours.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on driving refills and have implemented several new initiatives to further grow the brand. Some of these programs include patient relationship and support programs as well as partnering with pharmacies to help with the education and to drive patient adherence.\nAnd lastly, on Monjuvi, Minjuvi and Pemazyre on Slide 13. Monjuvi sales in the quarter were $21 million, up 11% year-over-year with community accounts making up the majority of the volume. Minjuvi sales were $7 million, and the product is now reimbursed in 6 key launch markets in Europe. Pemazyre grew to $21 million in net sales in Q1 with $5 million coming from outside the U.S., where the launch is now ongoing in 10 key markets in Europe.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nChief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President, Incyte Corp.\n\nThank you, Barry. On Slide 15 is a snapshot of a few of our programs, including our high potential programs as depicted in the red and blue boxes, segmented by estimated launch timing. Over the next 6 to 18 months, many of these programs will be expanding into new indications, new combination studies and into pivotal trials. .\nBy focusing resources on these assets, it could allow for an acceleration of certain timelines and increased efficiency as we bring these innovative therapies to patients. We are well positioned for growth and diversification with multiple launches expected in the near to midterm.\nMoving to Slide 16. We made significant progress across our high-potential dermatology programs. Opzelura was approved for vitiligo in Europe, and we presented new data for both Opzelura and povacitinib at 2 major dermatology conferences. We also progressed into new indications, including nodularis with Opzelura and asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria with porvocitinib.\nNow to highlight our dermatology portfolio in more detail, starting with Opzelura and the recent European approval on Slide 17. The label was very favorable with regards to both efficacy and safety. The full indication is for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age upwards.\nThis encompasses the majority of vitiligo patients in Europe, where roughly 85% of all vitiligo patients have nonsegmental disease were around 60% to 80% of facial involvement. Regarding safety, the most common adverse reaction was application site acne. No black triangle was placed on the label and the regulatory agency determined that the class effect identified for the oral class were not considered relevant for Opzelura. And as such, the label does not include any special warnings or precautions as seen with the oral JAK inhibitors.\nTurning to Slide 18. We recently initiated 2 Phase III studies evaluating Opzelura in prurigo nodularis, a disease driven by inflammation and characterized by hard modules and an intense itch. True PNI and PN2 of 52-week studies where patients will receive ruxolitinib cream or vehicle for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week open-label extension.\nThe primary endpoint is WI-NRS which is defined as a 4-point or greater improvement in worst-itch numerical rating scale score from baseline to week 12. There is a strong rationale for Opzelura in prurigo nodularis where we have seen promising early data and where there is already a regulatory precedent for approval with clearly defined endpoints.\nWith no topical or oral therapies approved, we have a significant opportunity to help a large population of patients who are suffering from this disease.\nTurning to Slide 19. We continue to expand the development of Opzelura into new indications, which it has the potential to provide significant value as either the first approved therapy or first topical therapy for patients living with these dermatologic conditions.\nMoving to povacitinib on Slide 20. We recently presented positive Phase II results at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual meeting, highlighting the effect of povacitinib on repigmentation in patients with extensive vitiligo. Substantial repigmentation was seen with povacitinib treatment and continue to improve with longer duration of therapy with up to 36% of povacitinib-treated patients achieving a facial VASI75 by week 36.\nBased on these positive Phase II results, we plan to move into Phase III development. Being able to provide patients with an effective oral therapy to treat vitiligo as part of our strategy to strengthen our leadership in Village and to be able to provide multiple treatment options for patients across the entire disease spectrum.\nOn Slide 21, at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation Conference, we presented Phase II data showing that 52% to 56% of patients treated with povacitinib achieved a HiSCR 50 at week 16. Perhaps even more impressive was that up to 29% of patients on povacitinib reached HiSCR 100 at week 52, which is a 100% reduction in abscessive nodule count, with no increase in abscess or draining tunnel relative to the baseline.\nThis is a very high clinical bar of efficacy. We were the first to ever present the achievement of HiSCR 100 in HS. Based on the Phase II results, we initiated 2 Phase III trials: STOP HS1 and STOP HS2. Similar to ruxolitinib cream, we are building a portfolio for porvacitanib around the science all while leveraging our extensive dermatology capabilities. As mentioned earlier, we are initiating 2 phase trials in moderate to severe asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Given what is known about the involvement of the JAK pathway in the regulation of cytokines and Th2 cells, initiating a study in asthma is a logical next step for the development of povacitinib.\nLikewise, we know JAK inhibition can modulate cell activation, including degranulation and cytokine production, both of which are drivers of chronic spontaneous urticaria.\nMoving to our hematology and oncology portfolio on Slide 23. Looking at our high-potential oncology programs, we continue to make progress in myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs, with our and BET program and axatilimab in chronic graft-versus-host disease.\nOur small molecule PD-L1 program is advancing into multiple Phase II studies in combination with adagrasib, ipilimumab and axitinib. For our early-stage assets, we recently presented data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting for CDK2 and our newly disclosed bispecific PD-1 antibody.\nAnd lastly, we recently announced the approval of for cell carcinoma, which is currently in Phase III trials in squamous cell anal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer.\nTurning to Slide 24. We have several programs progressing in MPNs in graft-versus-host disease. Zilugasertib is in dose escalation. We are currently at doses of 400 milligrams once daily in combination with ruxolitinib, and we were adding a treatment arm for newly diagnosed patients. We continue to see signs of clinical activity, including decreased levels of hepcidin as well as hemoglobin responses with no dose limiting toxicities to date.\nFor our BET inhibitor, dose escalation is ongoing, where we are currently at doses of 6 milligrams once daily in combination with ruxolitinib. In monotherapy and in combination therapy, we have seen reductions in spleen length and volume as well as improvements in both symptoms and hemoglobin, suggesting 57643 is an active compound.\nINCA33989, our mutant CALR antibody is on track to enter the clinic later this year. And the study evaluating CK0804 in combination with ruxolitinib continues to progress.\nLastly, we expect results from the IGARVI-201 study later this year. Before moving on to the next slide, I did want to speak briefly on the CRL for ruxolitinib XR. The FDA determined that while bioequivalence was achieved in the area under the curve or AUC they had questions around Siemens and its correlation with efficacy. We will work with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps and we will provide an update at that time.\nTurning to Slide 25. We preclinical data from our CDK2 and TGF bea R2 PD-1 bispecific. INCB123667, a selective oral small molecule CDK2 inhibitor, is in a Phase I dose ranging study in advanced solid tumors. CDK2 in complex with Cyclin E is a cell cycle regulator, which, when inhibited, has been shown to suppress tumor growth, mainly in Cyclin E high tumor models in vivo.\nOn the right is INCB33890, a TGFBR2/PD-1 bispecific, which has been engineered to invoid the known toxicity of broad TGF-beta pathway blockade. 33890 has a tenfold higher affinity for PD-1 and TGFbR2 and blocks signaling in cells co-expressing PD-1, thus potentially protecting normal tissue preclinical in vivo data presented at AACR showed that 33890 has a greater antitumor effect and individual benchmark antibodies or a simple combination of these.\nTurning to Slide 26. For the remainder of the year, we expect numerous data readouts and important strategic decisions for many of our high potential programs, and we look forward to updating you throughout the year.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product revenues of $693 million, representing an increase of 14% over the first quarter of 2022. .\nTotal product revenues are comprised of Jakafi, other hematology oncology products, which include Iclusig, Pemazyre and Minjuvi and Opzelura. Jakafi net product revenues for the first quarter were $580 million, which reflects continued growth in patient demand across all indications, partially offset by higher gross to net deductions as a result of both contributions to close the Medicare gap and commercial copay assistance in line with prior year's first quarter as well as an increase in 340B.\nThe quarter was also negatively impacted by lower than normal channel inventory at quarter end due to the timing of certain customer purchases. Other hematology/oncology net product revenues were $57 million, representing a 17% increase compared to the first quarter of 2022 driven by patient demand, partially offset by unfavorable changes in FX rates.\nOn a constant currency basis, the other hematology/oncology net product revenues grew by 22% over the prior year period. Finally, Opzelura net product revenues for the quarter were $57 million, representing a 4.5-fold increase year-over-year driven by increased patient demand and expanded coverage. This year-over-year growth was partially offset by an acceleration of refills at the end of last year and by higher gross to net deductions as a result of higher Medicaid utilization and higher commercial copay assistance, which is a typical Q1 dynamic.\nTurning to royalty revenues. Total royalty revenues for the quarter were $115 million and are comprised of royalties from Novartis of $77 million for Jakafi and $4 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $34 million for Olumiant.\nJakafi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were negatively impacted by FX headwinds, while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales and currency fluctuations, Olumiant royalties increased 37% compared to the prior year period.\nMoving on to Slide 30, our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D and total R&D expenses were $404 million and $407 million, respectively, for the first quarter. Total R&D expenses increased 15% year-over-year, driven primarily by the progression of our pipeline including the expansion of the clinical development program evaluating ruxolitinib cream in additional indications and the progression of provocitinib into pivotal studies, and were partially offset by lower upfront and milestone expenses in 2023.\nTotal SG&A expenses were $316 million for the first quarter. SG&A year-over-year growth was driven primarily by promotional activities launched at the beginning of the year to support Opzelura in AB and in vitiligo and the timing of certain other expenses.\nMoving on to our guidance for 2023. As a result of Jakafi's strong demand growth, we are raising the bottom end of our full year Jakafi guidance range of $2.53 billion to $2.63 billion to a new range of $2.55 billion to $2.63 billion. We are reaffirming our other hematology oncology revenues COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the floor for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Christine.\n\nChristine Chiou\n\nHead of IR, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are Herve, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks and Dash, who will join us for the Q&A.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC.\nWe will now begin the call with Herve.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was another successful year in which we delivered strong commercial performance and made significant advancements across all stages of our oncology and dermatology pipeline.\nRevenues from our current portfolio of commercialized products grew 18% year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year to $764 million and $2.7 billion, respectively. Total revenues for the year, which include our royalties grew 14% to $3.4 billion.\nAs we look across our portfolio, the drivers of this double-digit growth are the continued commercial execution for Jakafi, net sales of which increased $275 million in the year to reach $2.4 billion and initial contribution from recently launched products and indications, including Minjuvi and Pemazyre in Europe and Japan and Opzelura in the U.S.\nI want to touch briefly on Opzelura, which we believe will be a significant growth driver for Incyte. Opzelura was approved in September 2021 for atopic dermatitis. And this past July, we received approval and launched Opzelura in vitiligo as the first FDA-approved therapy for repigmentation. The approval was well-received by dermatologists, patients and patient advocacy group and the launch has been very successful.\nStrong patient demand and increasing formulary access drove net sales of $61 million in the fourth quarter and $129 million for the full year. In 2023, we expect an approval for Opzelura in vitiligo in Europe, which adds another layer of growth for the franchise.\nTurning now to our regulatory and R&D achievements. Our clinical development pipeline is focused on three therapeutic areas: MPN GVHD, other hematology and oncology and dermatology and we made significant progress across each of these three areas. In LIMBER, we presented new data from ongoing combination studies and disclosed an important new discovery asset targeting mutant CALR which has the potential to be a disease-modifying therapy for approximately 30% of patients in MF and ET.\nIn other hematology and oncology, we presented updated data for our oral PD-L1 inhibitor, 280, which shows promise both as a monotherapy and combination agent. We also progressed parsaclisib into Phase III for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a disease in which there are no approved therapies.\nAnd in dermatology, we continue to expand our portfolio with Opzelura and povorcitinib, focusing in disease area where there is a significant unmet need. Lastly, we had two important updates relating to patents. The first is that Incyte earned pediatric exclusivity, which entitles Incyte to 6 months of exclusivity added to our patents for Jakafi and Opzelura. This expands our ability to enforce our Jakafi patents through December 2028. This expansion further applies to our existing Opzelura patent.\nIn addition, late last year, we obtained an issued patent and allowed claims for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo, respectively. We are confident in the strength of these claims permitting us to protect Opzelura out to 2040 in the U.S.\nBefore moving into the outlook for 2023, I wanted to take a moment to look back at the growth of our product revenues as shown on Slide 6. Over the past 5 years, approvals for new products and indications as well as strong commercial execution of our existing portfolio has allowed us to grow our product revenues at a CAGR of 18%.\nOn Slide 7, looking at our historical operational performance. On the left is our revenues versus our total R&D and SG&A spend. We have delivered strong operational performance over the past 5 years with total revenue growing at a 17% CAGR and our operating expenses growing at a 13% CAGR.\nOn the right, we are showing our operating leverage, excluding the impact of dermatology on revenues and sales and marketing expenses. Here, you can see our operating performance is even more pronounced. We can expect to drive further operating leverage over time with our high-growth dermatology franchise, which is in early stages of launch and where we could see two additional approvals in the near term.\nTurning to Slide 8. As we look ahead for Incyte, there are four main drivers of sustainable growth, and we are already making significant progress in each of these areas and expect to continue to strong momentum throughout -- to continue the strong momentum throughout 2023.\nThe first driver is our Jakafi franchise and LIMBER program, where we aim to expand our leadership in MPN and GVHD. In 2023, beyond the approval of ruxolitinib XR, we expect important data, including pivotal results for our parsaclisib combination in suboptimal responders to Jakafi in MF. Next is Opzelura where we are launching in AD and vitiligo and where in 2023, we will be launching in Europe.\nIn other areas of clinical development, we expect new data from our oral PD-L1 program and povorcitinib in prurigo nodularis and vitiligo. Lastly, we will be monitoring early data from our CDK2 and mutant CALR program.\nWith that, I would like to pass the call to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive VP & GM of North America, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, Jakafi net sales grew 9% year-over-year to $647 million and grew 13% for the full year to $2.4 billion. Total patient demand rose 7% in 2022, driven by an increase in new patients across all indications. The launch of Jakafi in chronic GVHD continues to be strong with the total number of patients in Q4, growing 11% versus prior year quarter.\nA key driver of growth in GVHD is the duration of therapy and based on recent data, the average duration, which includes both acute and chronic is approximately 15 months.\nOn Slide 11, as you can see on the left, Jakafi has grown consistently year-over-year ranging from $200 million to $250 million each year. We expect to continue strong growth in 2023 with full year net product revenues to be between $2.53 billion to $2.63 billion.\nTurning to Opzelura on Slide 12. We had a strong quarter for Opzelura with continued double-digit sequential growth in patient demand in atopic dermatitis and a very successful launch in vitiligo. As you can see on the chart on the right, total demand, which includes both free and paid drug, grew 34% in Q4 versus prior quarter to reach 84,700 units, driven by both new patient growth and an increasing number of refills.\nPaid demand as shown by the light blue bars, grew 52% in Q4, driven by continued improvements in formulary access. As a result, net sales grew 61% versus prior quarter to $61 million. Total full year net sales for Opzelura were $129 million.\nLooking ahead, we expect both AD and vitiligo to be significant growth drivers for Opzelura. In AD, Opzelura is the #1 prescribed branded agent for new AD patients and its impact on itch, which remains unmatched by any other topical therapy continues to be the primary driver of prescribing. We expect the efficacy profile of Opzelura to continue to drive uptake in AD.\nIn terms of additional near-term growth opportunities, pending the results from the Phase III trial, we could see an approval in pediatric AD next year for 2 to 11-year olds. In vitiligo, the size of the market and the potential opportunity is substantial. There are an estimated 1.5 million patients diagnosed with vitiligo in the U.S. And prior to Opzelura's approval, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 patients were motivated to seek treatment.\nAs you know, Opzelura is the first and only product to be approved to help patients repigment their skin and this provides us with an opportunity to activate many of the 1.3 million patients that are naive to treatment or who have stopped seeking treatment altogether.\nAnd in the next few months, we expect the approval of Opzelura and vitiligo in Europe, where there are an estimated 1.5 million diagnosed patients living with the disease.\nSlide 14 shows a few examples of patient advocacy and consumer activity within the vitiligo community. We are already seeing high awareness and excitement for Opzelura from patients, and we will continue to build on that momentum throughout the year, including the commencement of TV direct-to-consumer this quarter. And lastly, on Monjuvi, Minjuvi and Pemazyre. Monjuvi sales in Q4 were $24 million, up 13% year-over-year, and revenues were $89 million for the year. The launch of Minjuvi is ongoing in four markets, and we continue to gain reimbursement in other European countries.\nNet sales for the full year were $20 million, which includes a negative $2 million of foreign exchange impact. Pemazyre grew to $83 million in net sales in 2022 with $20 million coming from outside the U.S., again, negatively impacted by foreign exchange by $3 million. In the U.S. Pemazyre continues to grow in total patients on therapy and is established as the standard of care for patients living with cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 alterations.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Medical Officer, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We made significant progress across our clinical development portfolio in 2022. We had multiple clinical and regulatory achievements throughout the year and I would like to use the next few slides to highlight a few of the key programs.\nStarting with our LIMBER program on Slide 18. Key data were presented at the 2022 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting where we had 57 abstracts accepted for presentation. Highlighting two of those presentations, starting on the left, we presented initial results of the Phase I/II study evaluating our ALK2 inhibitor to zilurgisertib in monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib, which demonstrated improvement in anemia and hemoglobin responses in patients with myelofibrosis. Additionally, we disclosed our discovery of 989, a novel anti-mutant calreticulin monoclonal antibody, which has been shown to selectively inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of cells harboring mutant CALR, while not affecting wild type or normal healthy cells.\nOn the right is a list of key updates across LIMBER that are expected this calendar year. Starting with ruxolitinib XR, we have a PDUFA date of March 23 this year, and the expected approval is an important step towards fixed-dose combinations with parsaclisib, zilurgisertib and our BET inhibitor.\nIn terms of data, we expect pivotal Phase III data for ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib in suboptimal responders as well as more mature data sets of ruxolitinib with ALK2 and BET in the second half of this year. Depending on what we see with our ALK2 and BET combinations, we could potentially see the start of pivotal trials with one or both of these compounds. Early in the pipeline is our anti-mutant CALR monoclonal antibody, which will enter the clinic this year.\nWith regards to graft versus host disease, we are expecting pivotal data midyear from AGAVE-201, a study evaluating axatilimab in third-line chronic graft versus host disease.\nMoving to the rest of our hematology and oncology portfolio. Key data for the small molecule oral PD-L1 program were presented at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer annual meeting. Both 280 and 318 demonstrated clinical activity with tumor shrinkage and were generally well-tolerated and we expect to share more mature data set in the second half of this year.\nIn addition, we plan to initiate combination trials of 280 with adagrasib, CTLA-4 and an oral VEGF inhibitor in the first half of this year. INCB123667, our novel potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of CDK2 entered Phase I clinical development. Here, we could see utility in cyclin E amplified or overexpressing cancers as well as in cancers that are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors.\nNow looking at our dermatology franchise on Slide 20. In July of last year, Opzelura gained its second indication in vitiligo. This was a huge achievement for the vitiligo community and people living with the disease. As we continue to maximize the potential with ruxolitinib cream, we initiated multiple Phase II studies in different conditions, including lichen planus, lichen sclerosis and hidradenitis suppurativa. In each of these diseases, there are no topical oral therapies approved. We have many important milestones in dermatology upcoming in 2023, ruxolitnib cream, the CHMP opinion in vitiligo is currently on track for the first quarter of this year, while data from the Phase III vitiligo maintenance and withdrawal study and the Phase III pediatric AD study will be available in the first and second half, respectively.\nTurning to povorcitinib. We expect Phase II data in both vitiligo and prurigo nodularis later this year. And additionally, I want to highlight that later this week at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation we have an oral presentation of the updated 52-week data from our Phase II study in HS, which should provide some additional insights into the durability of response with this agent.\nAnd lastly, Auremolimab our newly acquired IL-15 receptor beta monoclonal antibody is expected to enter the clinic for vitiligo. As you can see on Slide 21, we're looking forward to another busy year with multiple regulatory and clinical updates.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product revenues of $764 million, representing an increase of 18% over the fourth quarter of 2021. Total product revenues are comprised of $647 million for Jakafi, $55 million for other hematology/oncology products and $61 million for Opzelura.\nNet product revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in Jakafi and Opzelura net revenues. Other hematology/oncology revenues, which include revenues from parsaclisib, Pemazyre and Minjuvi were impacted by unfavorable changes in FX rates.\nOn a constant currency basis, other hematology/oncology net product revenues grew by 23% over the prior year period. Total royalty revenues for the quarter were $132 million and are comprised of royalties from Novartis of $91 million for Jakavi and $4 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $36 million for Olumiant. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were negatively impacted by FX headwinds, while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19.\nExcluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales and currency fluctuation, Olumiant royalties increased 23% compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2022, total net product revenues were $2.7 billion and total revenues were $3.4 billion, representing 18% and 14% year-over-year increase, respectively.\nMoving to Slide 25. Opzelura net product revenues for the quarter were $61 million, driven by robust demand and broadening payer access. As payers continue to add Opzelura to formularies and the share of covered claims increased, we continue to see improvement in the gross to net discount rate. The gross to net discount rate decreased from an average of 71% in the third quarter of 2022 to an average of 57% in the fourth quarter of this year, and we exited 2022 at a gross to net discount rate of 50%.\nWhile we will continue to work on reducing patient copay and in turn, improving gross to net, an average gross to net of 50% is a good working assumption for 2023 with the gross to net discount in the first quarter of the year expected to be higher than subsequent quarters as plans reset patient deductibles at the beginning of the year.\nI would also like to take the opportunity to update you on the Opzelura prescriptions data provided by IQVIA. As you see on Slide 26, in Q4, we saw the gap between the actual number of total prescriptions and the number of prescriptions reported by IQVIA narrowing. While the IQVIA data continues to overstate demand, this overstatement has been reduced to a level of 5% to 10%, which is within expectations for a newly launched product. In addition, it is important to note that IQVIA data reflects total demand, which includes both paid prescriptions and free drug.\nGoing forward, free drug is expected to represent around 20% of total demand. When looking at IQVIA data, one would need to adjust for this overstatement as well as for free drug in order to get a better sense of paid demand.\nMoving on to Slide 27 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses were $431 million for the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year 2022. Total R&D expenses, which include the upfront consideration of $70 million for our acquisition of Villaris were $501 million for the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year 2022, total R&D expenses, which in addition to the Villaris upfront payment also include $56 million in other milestone payments were $1.6 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year increase. The increase was primarily due to the progression of our pipeline and was partially offset by lower upfront and milestone expenses in 2022.\nTotal SG&A expenses were $273 million for the fourth quarter and $1 billion for the full year 2022. The year-over-year increase was driven by investments related to the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.\nMoving on to 2023. I will now discuss the key components of our guidance on a GAAP basis. For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.53 billion to $2.63 billion, which at the midpoint represents an increase of approximately $170 million over 2022, driven by continued growth across all indications. We expect our gross to net adjustments for 2023 to be approximately 23%, reflecting expected continued growth in 340B volumes. As a reminder, the gross to net adjustment in the first quarter of the year is always higher relative to other quarters and -- previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to our share of the donut hole for Medicare part D patients.\nFor other hematology oncology products, which include Pemazyre in the U.S., EU and Japan and Iclusig and Minjuvi in Europe, we are expecting total net product revenues to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million.\nTurning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis, we expect COGS in a range of 7% to 8% of net product revenues, which is in line with 2022. R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion, representing 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, primarily reflecting continued investment in Opzelura and the full year impact of the investment in the vitiligo indication.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristine Chiou\n\nHead of IR, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are Herve, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks; and Dash, who will join us for the Q&A.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC.\nWe will now begin the call with Herve.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, our product revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $713 million, benefiting from strong Jakafi sales growth as well as an increasing contribution from Opzelura net sales. Jakafi net sales grew 13% to $620 million, driven by robust growth in chronic GVHD as well as new patient growth in MF and PV. Opzelura net sales more than doubled versus prior quarter to $38 million, and we continued to execute on the successful launch in AD and vitiligo, driving increased demand, while also significantly improving formulary access. The ex U.S. launches of Pemazyre and Minjuvi, which are both still in early stages, contributed to the 19% growth coming from other hematology and oncology products.\nTurning to Slide 5. We have multiple opportunities for significant growth in both oncology and dermatology with our recent approvals and the potential for multiple new products and new indications over the next several years.\nFor our oncology franchise, recent launches in new indications and new markets provide further growth opportunities for Jakafi, Pemazyre and Minjuvi. In LIMBER, pivotal data from 2 programs, axatilimab in chronic GVHD and ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib in MF are expected next year. And we expect data for BET, ALK2 in 2022 and 2023 to define the path forward for this program.\nOutside of MPNs and GVHD, we have multiple early and late-stage clinical programs, including our oral PD-L1 program, which was the first to show clinical activity as an oral PD-L1, and we have updated data at SITC next week.\nIn addition to oncology is our dermatology franchise, where Opzelura is a key near-term driver with launches currently underway in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. Our dermatology pipeline is expanding with new indications being developed for ruxolitinib cream as well as povorcitinib and auremolimab in areas of high unmet medical needs. This positions us well for significant growth and diversification.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive VP & GM of North America, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. The launch of Opzelura continues to be very successful with double-digit demand growth in atopic dermatitis and strong uptake in vitiligo.\nNet sales grew 130% quarter-over-quarter to reach $38 million, led by strong patient demand and broader reimbursement coverage for Opzelura. Over 62,000 units of Opzelura were shipped in the quarter, representing a growth of 32% versus Q2. The positive feedback loop between patients and physicians, driven by the efficacy of Opzelura, continues to fuel the uptake in atopic dermatitis.\nOpzelura in vitiligo has been well received by both physicians and patients and is adding further to growth in demand. Opzelura access continues to improve as NDC blocks are removed and payers continue to add Opzelura onto their formularies.\nTurning to Slide 8, and Opzelura in AD. Opzelura is now the #1 prescribed agent for new AD patients amongst dermatologists with a new patient share of 17%. Opzelura is changing the treatment paradigm, helping to break the cycle of repeated failures on topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors.\nThe number of dermatologists gaining experience with Opzelura continues to increase and 96% of prescribers are reporting satisfaction with Opzelura. Efficacy and rapid itch reduction continues to be a top driver for prescribing. And when it comes to selecting patients for therapy, dermatologists consider half of their AD patients as candidates for Opzelura. We expect the number of patient initiations per prescriber to continue to increase over time.\nTurning now to launch in vitiligo, where we are seeing positive early momentum. Awareness levels are high, with 9 out of 10 dermatologists aware of Opzelura as a treatment for vitiligo. Dermatologists view Opzelura, which is the first-ever approved treatment for repigmentation, as a transformative therapy for patients living with vitiligo.\nIn a recent survey, as shown on the left, dermatologists indicated their use of Opzelura in vitiligo would more than triple in the next 6 months. Of their currently treated vitiligo patients, dermatologists consider nearly 70% could be candidates for treatment with Opzelura.\nFor the 1.3 million diagnosed vitiligo patients who are currently not seeking treatment, we are launching several initiatives, including direct-to-consumer campaigns, patient advocacy group engagements and branded patient meetings to raise awareness and encourage those patients to seek treatment now that there is a new approved therapy. Both AD and vitiligo are substantial opportunities, and we expect Opzelura to become a meaningful growth driver over the next several years.\nOn Slide 10, payer coverage for Opzelura continues to improve, with a percentage of covered claims increasing from an average of 39% in the second quarter to 63% in the third quarter and reaching 70% in October. With an increasing number of plans adding Opzelura on to formularies and the continued removal of NDC blocks, we have started to gradually shut down the full buy-down program and transition to a more traditional free drug bridging program.\nWe expect to fully discontinue the full buy-down program around the end of the year. Please note that during this period of transition to the free drug bridging program, we expect variability in how IQVIA captures those prescriptions, which may lead to data not being representative of the actual prescription levels and trends.\nMoving on to Jakafi performance on Slide 11. Jakafi net sales in the third quarter grew 13% year-over-year to $620 million, driven by growth in new patients across all indications. Within myelofibrosis, new patient starts grew by 8% and in polycythemia vera by 9%, total GVHD patients grew 20% year-over-year with the continued successful launch in the chronic setting. With strong demand for Jakafi, we are again tightening the full year net product revenue guidance from a range of $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion to a new range of $2.38 billion to $2.4 billion.\nTurning to Slide 12. Monjuvi net product sales in the U.S. were $22 million in the third quarter. We continue to see gradual improvement in duration of therapy as use continues to expand in the second line. Minjuvi net sales were $6 million for the quarter, with the launch going well in Germany and where we have seen several months of consecutive growth.\nPemazyre worldwide net sales were $23 million, with the launch continuing to progress in Europe and Japan. During the quarter, we also received approval of Pemazyre as the first targeted therapy in the United States for myeloid lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangement, an extremely rare and aggressive blood cancer.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Medical Officer, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We recently presented positive Phase II data of povorcitinib in hidradenitis suppurativa at the 2022 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress, which demonstrated that patients on povorcitinib had significantly greater decreases in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count versus placebo from baseline to week 16.\nIn addition, HS Clinical Response, or HiSCR, which is defined as a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count and no increase in abscess count or draining fistulas compared to baseline, was achieved in a greater percentage of povorcitinib patients than placebo at week 16. Hidradenitis suppurativa represents a significant opportunity where there are more than 150,000 patients with moderate-to-severe disease in the United States.\nIn October, our pivotal Phase III data of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and these data highlight the positive efficacy and safety profile of Opzelura as a treatment for repigmentation in vitiligo. The MAA for Opzelura in vitiligo is under review, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of next year.\nMoving to Slide 16. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire Villaris Therapeutics and their lead asset, auremolimab, a highly potent and selective anti-IL-15 receptor beta monoclonal antibody. IL-15 signaling occurs upstream of the JAK-STAT pathway and demonstrates a strong scientific rationale for the evaluation of IL-15 blockade in vitiligo and other dermatologic conditions.\nIn vitiligo, preclinical data suggests that maintenance and relapse is driven by resident memory T cells, or TRM, in the skin. IL-15 is critical for the survival of TRM and IL-15 blockade may result in the depletion of resident memory T cells, leading to a longer and more durable repigmentation effect.\nThe addition of auremolimab to our dermatology portfolio bolsters our commitment to patients living with vitiligo and potentially offers optionality based on severity of disease as well as different dosing options that may allow for combination therapy, all of which is complementary to our JAK franchise. We are planning on entering clinical development with auremolimab in 2023.\nOn Slide 17 is an updated table of our extensive clinical development pipeline in dermatology. With regards to ruxolitinib cream in hand eczema, after discussions with the FDA, it was deemed not necessary to run a larger Phase III clinical trial in chronic hand eczema as the indication is covered by the current label.\nWe've also added 2 new indications in the development plan for ruxolitinib cream with 2 Phase II trials in preparation for lichen sclerosis and lichen planus. Additionally, auremolimab in vitiligo has been included, which is expected to enter clinical development in 2023, as I mentioned earlier.\nTurning to Slide 18 and axatilimab. As a reminder, the Phase I/II study in chronic graft-versus-host disease, this was an open-label study evaluating axatilimab, an anti-CSF1R antibody, in patients 6 years and older with active chronic graft-versus-host disease in the third line plus setting. In this heavily pretreated patient population, axatilimab monotherapy resulted in a best overall response rate of 68% across both doses of 1 milligram per kilogram every 2 weeks and 3 milligrams per kilogram every 4 weeks. 53% of patients reported a clinical meaningful improvement in their symptoms via the Lee Symptom Scale. Axatilimab was also well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with no viral reactivations in the study.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate data from the ongoing AGAVE-201 pivotal trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease in mid-2023 and thus the potential BLA filing later in 2023. In addition, a combinational trial of axatilimab and ruxolitinib in steroid-naive chronic graft-versus-host disease is in preparation with an expected initiation in the first quarter of next year.\nOn the next slide and our progress in myeloproliferative neoplasms and graft-versus-host disease in general. We continue to advance our LIMBER pipeline and expect to achieve many important milestones in the remaining months of 2022 and into 2023.\nThe Phase I study of ruxolitinib in combination with Cellenkos' CK-0804 in myelofibrosis has initiated with the first patient dosed in October. Later this year, we expect to present initial data from the BET and ALK2 programs. The target action date for once-daily ruxolitinib is March 23, 2023. And we expect top line results from the Phase III study of parsaclisib plus ruxolitinib in inadequate responders in 2023 as well.\nTurning to Slide 20 and our oral PD-L1 program. We continue to progress the development of our oral PD-L1 program with 2 compounds, 280 and 318, which have been prioritized based on observation of tumor shrinkage and to date, no evidence of peripheral neuropathy with either compound. We will be presenting updated data on both compounds at the Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting in Boston next week.\nThe third quarter was successful for Incyte across regulatory, clinical and business development, and we are looking forward to an exciting close to the year.\nI'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product revenues of $713 million, representing an increase of 20% over the third quarter of 2021. Total product revenues are comprised of $620 million for Jakafi, $55 million for other hematology/oncology products and $38 million for Opzelura.\nNet product revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in Jakafi and Opzelura net revenues. Hematology/oncology net revenues, which include revenues from Iclusig, Pemazyre and Minjuvi, were impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, other hematology/oncology net product revenues grew by 32% over the prior-year period.\nTotal royalty revenues for the quarter were $110 million and are comprised of royalties from Novartis of $86 million for Jakavi and $4 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $20 million for Olumiant. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were negatively impacted by FX headwinds, while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19 and a onetime deduction taken by Lilly related to securing additional intellectual property rights.\nExcluding the impact of onetime IP payments, COVID-19 related sales and currency fluctuations, Olumiant royalties were essentially flat on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period. Opzelura net product revenues for the quarter were $38 million, driven by robust demand and broadening payer access. As payers add Opzelura to formulary and the share of covered claims increases, we are continuing to see improvement in the gross to net discount rate.\nAs Barry previously presented, the percentage of covered claims is increasing, and the average quarterly gross to net discount is decreasing, as shown at the bottom of the slide. The fully loaded gross to net discount rate decreased from 81% in the second quarter of 2022 to 71% in the third quarter of this year. We expect the gross to net discount rate to continue to decline in the fourth quarter and reach a fully loaded steady-state exit rate of 40% to 50% around year-end.\nMoving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $351 million for the third quarter increased 6% from the prior-year period, primarily due to continued investment in our late-stage development assets. The growth of SG&A expenses was primarily due to our investments related to the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $2 million, which represents our 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi.\nMoving on to our guidance for 2022. Based on the strong performance of Jakafi, we are tightening our guidance to a range of $2.38 billion to $2.4 billion. Given FX headwinds that we experienced year-to-date and expect to continue to experience in the fourth quarter, we are revising our other hematology/oncology revenue guidance to a range of $200 million to $210 million.\nFinally, we are reaffirming our R&D guidance, which now includes the $70 million upfront payment to Villaris anticipated in Q4 as well as SG&A guidance for the year.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call to Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Christine.\n\nChristine Chiou\n\nHead of IR, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are Herve, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks and Dash, who will join us for the Q&A.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC.\nWe will now begin the call with Herve.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, revenues increased 29% year-over-year, reaching $911 million. Jakafi net sales grew 13% to $598 million, benefiting from growth in new patient start in all 3 indications. The contribution from our other hematology and oncology products continued to increase as the launches of Monjuvi and Minjuvi progress in Europe and Japan.\nWe also made significant progress with the launch of Opzelura in atopic dermatitis where we now have the third PBM GPO contract signed. This is a key milestone in achieving broad formulary access and an important step towards accelerating the growth of Opzelura net revenues. As we shift from free drug to paid prescription, we are seeing some temporary delays in the filling of prescription, which had an impact on second quarter revenues. However, patient demand and satisfaction remains strong and improvement in reimbursement are translating to an increase in covered claims with a significant increase seen in July.\nThese metrics are pointing to a continuation of a successful launch in atopic dermatitis. Turning to Slide 5. Two weeks ago, Opzelura was also approved for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo, becoming the first and only therapy for repigmentation for these patients.\nThe approval of Opzelura was a momentous occasion for the millions of people living with the disease and generated a tremendous amount of excitement in the dermatology community with advocacy groups and patients.\nTurning to Slide 6. We also had multiple approvals this quarter with our partnered products. Jakavi was approved as the first post-steroid systemic treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD in Europe. Olumiant was approved as the first and only systemic treatment for alopecia areata in the U.S., Europe and Japan. And Tabrecta received European approval for a subgroup of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Together, these approvals provided insight with $130 million of milestone revenues and will contribute with royalties to our future revenue growth.\nFinally, looking at some of the additional highlights of our pipeline on Slide 7, for povorcitinib, formerly known at 707, is now in preparation for a Phase III study in HS following the positive results from our Phase II trial. As part of the LIMBER program, IND clearance was received for CK0804, Cellenkos, cord blood-derived T-regulatory cells as add-on therapy to ruxolitinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. We also received FDA clearance -- FDA acceptance of the NDA submission for QD ruxolitinib with a PDUFA date of March 23.\nAnd lastly, in early development, we expect to initiate a clinical program later this year with 459, a LAG-3 PD-1 bispecific antibody developed in partnership with Merus. We have multiple ongoing studies across dermatology, LIMBER and hematology/oncology, as you can see on the right, where each represents a meaningful opportunity and puts us in an excellent position for future growth and diversification.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive VP & GM of North America, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone.\nStarting with Opzelura. The launch in atopic dermatitis continues to be strong, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made across the number of important metrics. To date, over 10,000 physicians have prescribed Opzelura with new writers being added each week.\nPhysicians continue to report a high level of satisfaction with Opzelura with 67% stating that they are highly satisfied, up from 46% earlier this year. Additionally, in a recent poll, physicians indicated nearly half of their AD patients would be appropriate candidates for Opzelura, up from 37% earlier this year.\nEfficacy, including rapid itch reduction, as well as tolerability and the ability to use Opzelura in sensitive areas remain the key product attributes, and we expect these attributes to continue to drive demand for Opzelura in AD.\nTurning to Slide 10. Earlier this month, we announced that we now have signed contracts with the largest -- with the 3 largest PBM/GPOs, an outstanding achievement 10 months into launch, and a key step towards reaching our steady-state gross to net goal.\nThe contract with the third PBM became effective July 1st and individual plans will now be adding Opzelura to their formularies. The charts shown on this slide is our internal 867 data, which is the number of Opzelura units shipped from wholesalers to pharmacies.\nWith regards to IQVIA data, there has been an increased variability with the data in recent weeks. The overall trend shown by IQVIA data is representative of the actual kinetics. However, the number of filled prescriptions as reported by IQVIA are being over projected. It is important to take away from this slide a couple of points, both on Q2 performance and on recent trends.\nIn the second quarter, as NDC blocks were removed and Opzelura was added to formularies, pharmacists and dermatologists began to shift from the process of the free drug program to going through the formulary process. This shift has 2 different effects. One is a temporary delay of filled prescriptions, which you saw in the second quarter; and two, is the positive impact on covered claims, the benefit of which will be more pronounced beginning in Q3.\nWe are already seeing a return of 867 demand to within the range of our highest point since launch. Additionally, the percentage of covered claims, as shown by the red line, has risen rapidly from the mid-20% range at the end of June to nearly 55% today. We anticipate, with the combined effect of an increased number of filled prescriptions and improving gross to net, Opzelura will have a more meaningful contribution to net sales in the second half of this year.\nOn Slide 11, we're turning to vitiligo. This slide captures some of the highlights from Opzelura's FDA-approved label, as the first treatment for repigmentation in vitiligo. This is a historic approval for patients living with this disease, and the approved label includes a number of important points that will help to drive the success of the product in this indication. Opzelura is approved for patients 12 years of age and older and can be applied to affected areas up to 10% BSA.\nThe label allows for continuous use of Opzelura anywhere on the body, including sensitive areas, with no limit on duration of use. The 52-week efficacy data, which has been included in the label, demonstrates the continued improvement in repigmentation with longer duration of treatment, highlighting the importance of staying on therapy. The label also notes that a satisfactory patient response may require treatment with Opzelura for more than 24 weeks.\nAnd lastly, Opzelura was well tolerated with application site acne as the most common AE in 6% of the patients.\nTurning to Slide 12 for the launch in vitiligo. Remember, these are the same target physicians as with AD, where we'll be able to leverage our existing relationships with physicians and to be able to benefit from the high level of satisfaction and experience that may have -- that many already have with Opzelura today.\nOur launch is underway with a comprehensive multichannel marketing campaign that will ensure broad and consistent reach to effectively drive awareness and importantly, to educate physicians on Opzelura's mechanism of action, its impact on vitiligo and its unique clinical profile.\nTo support the launch of Opzelura in vitiligo, from a patient perspective, we're focusing on raising awareness and providing best-in-class support. We plan to build awareness and activate patients living with vitiligo through a strong presence on social media, print and eventually TV.\nWe are also partnering with advocacy groups where there has been an enormous amount of excitement for Opzelura in vitiligo. This will be the first treatment for repigmentation available for these patients and the safety and efficacy profile has been proven in the largest randomized clinical trial in this setting.\nIt is important to drive patient adherence and compliance on Opzelura. This will, of course, begin with physicians setting the right expectations and we will provide tools to help ensure patients have successful treatment experience. We will launch a new Vitiligo app, along with other tools designed to help patients track their treatment and response as well as provide appointment reminders, which we expect to have a positive impact on patient adherence. And of course, we will continue to provide access to Opzelura with co-pay assistance that can lower co-pays to as low as $10 a month.\nWe see this launch in vitiligo as one of the largest opportunities for our franchise. We are starting with a very good label, and we have heard from patients and advocacy groups around the country, there is a large established medical need. This, together with the momentum from the launch in AD, will support a very successful launch.\nMoving on to Jakafi on Slide 14. Jakafi net sales in the second quarter grew 13% year-over-year to $598 million. Total patient demand grew across all indications, and the growth in new patient starts continues to remain above pre-pandemic levels. GVHD patient growth of 18% year-over-year was driven mainly by the launch in the chronic setting. With strong demand for Jakafi, we are again raising the bottom end of our Jakafi full year net product revenue guidance from $2.33 billion to a new range of $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion.\nTurning to Slide 15. Monjuvi net product sales in the U.S. grew to $23 million in the second quarter with more use moving into the second-line setting and a gradual improvement in duration. Minjuvi net sales were $4 million, where the launch is ongoing in Germany and share in second line continues to increase.\nPemazyre worldwide net sales were $19 million with the launch currently ongoing in Europe and Japan.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Medical Officer, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We are making significant progress within our dermatology pipeline. As you know, Opzelura received FDA approval in vitiligo a few weeks ago and has now obtained 2 important FDA approvals in less than a year. We will continue to pursue other indications that may expand the use of ruxolitinib cream to more patient populations in need.\nAdditionally, we are developing our oral JAK1 inhibitor, povorcitinib, formerly INCB54707 in hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and prurigo nodularis, all of which are in Phase II. And as Herve mentioned earlier, we are preparing a Phase III in hidradenitis suppurativa. There is significant potential with each of these indications where there are limited treatment options, when some cases, no FDA-approved treatments. One of the interesting studies we are doing with ruxolitinib cream is the long-term extension of the TRuE-V studies where we are evaluating the duration of response following the withdrawal of Opzelura.\nOn the left, you can see the study design for the TRuE-V studies. At 24 weeks, after the primary endpoint has been reached, patients could roll over into the long-term extension study for an additional 28 weeks. At 52 weeks, patients who achieved at least a facial VASI90 response are then randomized 1:1 to receive 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID or vehicle.\nAdditionally, those patients who did not achieve at least a facial VASI90 response at 52 weeks are maintained on therapy with 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID. The primary endpoint of the study is time to relapse in those who are placed on vehicle with numerous secondary endpoints.\nMoving to Slide 19. We are announcing today the most recent compound moving into clinical development, INCA32459, a LAG-3 PD-1 bispecific antibody. INCA32459 has been shown to be superior to independent LAG-3 and PD-1 blocking in the LAG-3 PD-1 dual receptor assay and has increased cellular activity compared to a combination of the monoclonal antibodies.\nAdditionally, in a humanized mouse model, 459 controls tumor growth better than the combination and gives us confidence that it may provide differentiated pharmacology and a clinical profile relative to current treatments.\nOn the next slide, we have a number of opportunities within LIMBER to expand our leadership in MPNs and GVHD with multiple programs reaching important milestones in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. The NDA was accepted by the FDA for QD ruxolitinib. And later this year, we expect initial data from the BET and ALK2 programs in combination with ruxolitinib, and we plan to start a Phase I program evaluating the combination of CK0804 and ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis.\nThe second quarter was a very successful quarter for Incyte with multiple products and partnered product approvals, and we look forward to a busy second half of the year. I'd now like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product revenues of $664 million, representing an increase of 15% over the second quarter of 2021. Total product revenues are comprised of $598 million for Jakafi, $50 million for other hematology/oncology products and $17 million for Opzelura.\nTotal royalty revenues for the quarter were $118 million and are comprised of royalties from Novartis of $84 million for Jakavi and $4 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $30 million for Olumiant. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were negatively impacted by FX headwinds, and while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19.\nFinally, total revenues for the quarter grew to $911 million, a 29% increase over the prior year period as a result of the growth in product revenues as well as $130 million in milestone revenues related to the multiple partner products approvals achieved this quarter.\nTurning to Opzelura. We recorded gross product sales of $89 million in the second quarter. As payers add, Opzelura to formularies, we are continuing to see improvement in the gross to net discount rate. The fully loaded gross to net discount rate decreased from [86%] in the first quarter of 2022 to 81% in the second quarter of the year, leading to net product sales for the quarter of $17 million.\nAs you can see on Slide 25, the evolution of the actual gross to net discount rate in Q2, represented by the green line, continues to be very much on track with the forecast we showed you earlier in the year. We expect the gross to net discount rate to continue to decline in the second half of the year and normalize at a fully loaded rate of 40% to 50% by the end of the year.\nMoving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $344 million for the second quarter increased 2% from the prior year period, primarily due to the continued investment in our late-stage development assets. SG&A expense for the second quarter of $253 million, increased 50% from the prior year period. The growth was primarily due to our investments related to the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura in atopic dermatitis and prelaunch activities for Vitiligo.\nOur collaboration loss for the quarter was $3 million, which represents our 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. Finally, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nMoving on to our guidance for 2022. As a result of our strong second quarter performance, we are tightening again our Jakafi guidance range from $2.33 billion to $2.4 billion to a new range of $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion. We are also reaffirming our other hematology/oncology revenue, COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristine Chiou\n\nHead of IR, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website.\nJoining me on the call today are Herve, Barry, Steven and Christiana who will deliver our prepared remarks and Dash, who will join us for the Q&A.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC.\nWe will now begin the call with Herve.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Incyte's strong momentum in 2021 continued into the first quarter with product and royalty revenues up 20%. Jakafi grew 17% year-over-year with patient demand driving growth in MF and PV as well as in GVHD following the successful launch in the chronic indication. Our hematology and oncology portfolio grew 24% year-over-year, driven by our new product uptake consisting of multiple new launches, including Pemazyre in Europe and Japan and Minjuvi in Europe. The Opzelura launch continued to be very successful with strong uptake by dermatologists, high satisfaction reported by both patients and physicians and significant advancements with payers, which Barry will address in his remarks.\nWe made progress across all stages of our pipeline with important updates that include positive 52-week data for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo, the prioritization of 280 and 318 in our oral PD-L1 program and the start of our CDK2 clinical program.\nOur royalty revenue remained strong, growing 23% year-over-year, contributing to our growth profile.\nTurning to Slide 5. As you can see on the left, we are still in the early phase of launch for many of these products, including Opzelura in atopic dermatitis, Pemazyre in cholangiocarcinoma, where we are expanding geographically; and Minjuvi, which is just starting to launch in Europe and Jakafi where we have recently launched in chronic GVHD in the U.S. There is ample room for growth with each of these new launches. On top of that, we have new potential indication that we'll be providing additional growth opportunities with Opzelura in vitiligo and with our partner product where we have new indication being planned over the next few months for Olumiant, Tabrecta and Jakavi.\nIn addition to these launches, there are a number of programs in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, as shown on the right that could have a meaningful impact on our revenue.\nBefore handing the call to Barry, I would like to provide an update on Opzelura manufacturing. We have recently received FDA approval and have implemented the new manufacturing process to improve the dissolution of API for Opzelura. In addition, consistent with best practices, we have received FDA approval for a second manufacturer of Opzelura to support our successful launch. We are also preparing to reintroduce samples in the U.S.\nNow to share more details on product performance and outlook, I will turn the call over to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive VP & GM of North America, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Hervé, and good morning, everyone. The launch of Opzelura in the U.S. is off to an excellent start with over 68,000 total prescriptions written through the end of the first quarter. More than 38,000 new patients were treated in the first quarter bringing the total number of new patients treated with Opzelura to over 57,000 since launch. We attribute the robust uptake and the very high satisfaction of both patients and physicians which is fueling the positive feedback loop and driving demand. Patients are requesting refills, which accounted for roughly 23% of prescriptions in the last week of Q1, another good indicator of long-term growth potential for Opzelura. On the payer front, we have added coverage of over 75 million additional lives since the end of January. This brings the total number of covered lives to 146 million, highlighting the progress we have and continue to make in the early months of launch.\nTurning to Slide 8. Multiple leading indicators are supporting the long-term potential of Opzelura, including market share gains for new patients and positive feedback on patient experience. In just 6 months since launch, our 12% new patient share now exceeds that of Eucrisa and Dupixent, highlighting the unmet need for more efficacious treatments for atopic dermatitis patients. Over 7,500 physicians have now prescribed Opzelura. We continue to increase our prescriber depth week-over-week, gaining an average of 200 to 300 new writers each week. Our high decile prescribers, those who see the highest volume of AD patients each week and who have written the scripts for Opzelura have initiated an average of 18 new patients of Opzelura since launch.\nThis repeat prescribing shows the positive experience and confidence that physicians are having with Opzelura and is supported by recent market research from the field. We are receiving very favorable feedback from the physicians about the efficacy of Opzelura, resulting in a high rate of satisfaction among both patients and physicians. In a recent survey, over half of physicians indicated they expect to increase prescribing of Opzelura in the next 3 months with over 60% of our top dermatologists indicating (technical difficulty) use of Opzelura will more than double in the coming months.\nMoving on to our progress with payers on -- (technical difficulty) Since our last update -- Q4 earnings call, we were able to get NDC blocks removed with one national PBM, one large national health plan and multiple key regional plans, adding approximately 53 million commercial lives, which are now covered, including our progress with Medicaid and government channels, our total number of lives covered has increased by 75 million to reach 146 million, which is outstanding progress in the short amount of time. As a final note on Opzelura, we are also preparing to reintroduce samples in the United States.\nTurning to Slide 10 and Jakafi performance. Jakafi net sales in the first quarter grew 17% year-over-year to $544 million. Total patient demand grew across all indications and the growth in new patient starts of 12% and versus the first quarter of 2021 remains above pre-pandemic levels. New patient starts in GVHD grew 25% year-over-year, with strength coming from the launch in the chronic indication. With the strong demand for Jakafi, we are raising the bottom end of our Jakafi full year net product revenue guidance from $2.3 billion to a new range of $2.33 billion to $2.4 billion.\nTurning to Slide 11. Monjuvi net product sales in the U.S. grew 21% year-over-year to $19 million in the first quarter, and we are continuing to see uptake in new and existing accounts, more second-line use and a gradual improvement in duration of therapy. Minjuvi net sales were $5 million, with the launch ongoing in Germany, and we continue to seek reimbursement in other countries. Pemazyre grew 34% to $18 million with the duration of therapy continuing to drive its performance.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Medical Officer, Incyte Corporation\n\nThanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. Starting with ruxolitinib cream on Slide 13. Last month, we presented updated 52-week data for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting. As a reminder, during the 24-week double-blind period, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ruxolitinib cream 1.5% b.i.d. or vehicle. After the 24-week visit, all patients crossed over to active therapy.\nAt 52 weeks, approximately 50% of the patients initially randomized to ruxolitinib cream experienced at least a 75% improvement in their VASI score from baseline, and nearly 1/3 of patients experienced at least a 90% improvement in facial VASI. No new safety signals were seen and ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. These data demonstrate the potential for substantial improvement in repigmentation with a longer duration of treatment with ruxolitinib cream.\nAlso at AAD, we presented data from our population-based VALIANT study, which aim to better understand quality-of-life burden faced (technical difficulty). In studies, anxiety and depression were reported in up to 68% and 62% of patients with vitiligo, respectively.\nThe psychological impairment that may result from vitiligo can be similar to that of other skin diseases such as psoriasis or eczema and can impact patients of all types, indiscriminative skin color, percentage body surface area involvement or the area affected. Many patients of vitiligo have stopped seeking treatment due to a lack of approved therapies. We are excited with the potential to bring the first FDA-approved therapy for repigmentation to people with vitiligo and to be able to offer them a new choice of therapy. Ruxolitinib cream is under review both in the United States and in Europe with the PDUFA date in the United States of July 18.\nMoving to Slide 15. We are initiating a study in vitiligo to evaluate the benefit of adding phototherapy to ruxolitinib cream treatment. This is a 48-week trial where patients will receive 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily for 12 weeks followed by ruxolitinib cream plus or minus phototherapy.\nRounding up dermatology, INCB54707, is in Phase II studies for vitiligo, hidradenitis suppurativa and prurigo nodularis where there continues to be high unmet medical need and the lack of effective therapies or in some cases, no approved therapies at all. We expect to present data for vitiligo and hidradenitis suppurativa in the second half of this year.\nTurning to Slide 17 and our Oral PD-L1 program. Last year at SITC, we presented data on the 3 compounds in our oral PD-L1 program, where we demonstrated the first clinical activity with an oral PD-L1 inhibitor. We saw evidence of tumor shrinkage with all 3 compounds. And in the case of 86550, an increased rate of peripheral neuropathy. Based on clinical data from ongoing studies and positive therapeutic ratios seen for 280 and 318, we have opted to move forward with these 2 compounds. Enrollment is progressing well in both studies with 280 and 318. We continue to observe tumor shrinkage with both compounds and to date, no evidence of peripheral neuropathy has been seen. There are several benefits to an oral PD-L1 including the potential for better management of immune-related adverse events due to a shorter half-life, the opportunity of developing oral-oral combinations and the ease of dosing with an oral agent. We expect to provide a data update from our oral PD-L1 program in the second half of this year.\nMoving to early development on Slide 18. We are initiating a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study in advanced solid tumors with our novel, potent and selective oral small molecule CDK2 inhibitor, iNCB123667. CDK2 in complex with Cyclin E is a cell cycle regulator, which, when inhibited, has been shown to suppress tumor growth, mainly in Cyclin E amplified tumor models. -- Cyclin E is an amplified oncogene in multiple aggressive cancer types, including ovarian and endometrial cancer.\nTo close, we expect multiple regulatory and key clinical data readout this year as shown on Slide 19. Specifically for LIMBER, the once-daily rux NDA will be submitted in this half of 2022. The BET and ALK2 combination with ruxolitinib are progressing well with data expected in the second half of 2022. The ruxolitinib cream, PDUFA, for vitiligo in the United States is July 18, and we expect an EMA decision in the second half of this year as well. For our partnered products, ruxolitinib in acute and chronic graft versus host disease and capmatinib in non-small cell lung cancer, both have received positive CHMP opinions.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total products and royalty revenues of $728 million, representing an increase of 20% over the first quarter of 2021 and reflecting growth across products commercialized by Incyte and Incyte discovered products commercialized by our partners. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $544 million for Jakafi, $49 million for other hematology/oncology products and $13 million for Opzelura. Royalties from Novartis of $71 million for Jakavi and $3 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $48 million for Olumiant.\nTurning to Opzelura, in the first quarter, the growth in prescriptions continued to be strong, leading to gross product sales of $90 million for the quarter. As payers add Opzelura to formularies, we are starting to see the improvement in the gross to net discount rate. The fully-loaded gross to net discount rate decreased from 92% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 86% in the first quarter of 2022, leading to net product sales for the quarter of $13 million.\nOn our Q4 call earlier this year, we showed you our forecast of the evolution of the gross to net discount rate as depicted by the dotted blue line. The green line represents our actual gross to net discount. And as you can see, Q1 was very much on target. We expect the gross to net discount rate to continue to decline in Q2 and normalize at a fully loaded rate of 40% to 50% between Q3 and Q4, depending on the timing of the removal of the remaining NDC blocks by PBMs and the addition of Opzelura on formularies.\nMoving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expense of $333 million for the first quarter decreased 13% from the prior year period primarily due to -- increased 13% from the prior year period, primarily due to the continued investment in our late-stage development assets. Total R&D expense of $353 million for the first quarter includes milestone consideration of $20 million for our collaborative agreements.\nSG&A expense for the first quarter of $210 million increased 36% from the prior year period's total SG&A expense or 49%, excluding the $13 million onetime payment recorded in the first quarter of 2021. The growth was primarily due to our investments related to the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura. Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $5 million, which represents a 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi.\nFinally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nMoving on to our guidance for 2022, as a result of our strong first quarter performance as well as signs and expectations of sites reopening and providing us with increased access to physicians, we are tightening our Jakafi guidance range from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion to a new range of $2.33 billion to $2.4 billion. We are also reaffirming our other hematology/oncology revenue, COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions)\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristine Chiou\n\nHead of IR, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin? Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are Hervé, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and Dash, who will join us for the Q&A. .\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC. We will now begin the call with Hervé.\n\nHervé Hoppenot\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4. So we had another year of strong commercial performance with product and royalty revenues growing 17% to reach $2.9 billion, representing a CAGR of 24% over the past 5 years. We have been able to maintain this level of growth through continued commercial execution for Jakafi, launches of new products and new indications across the U.S., Europe and Japan, and a rapidly growing royalty revenue stream. Jakafi grew 10% for the full year and was up 15% in the fourth quarter, driven by the launch in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD and robust new patient growth in MF and PV.\nFor the full year, our other hematology and oncology portfolio grew 40% year-over-year with contribution from new product launches, including $69 million from Pemazyre and $5 million from Minjuvi and our royalty revenues grew 45% to $569 million for the full year. What's important to note is that this growth does not yet include meaningful contribution from recently approved products such as Minjuvi in Europe and Opzelura in the U.S.\nOn Slide 5, as we look ahead to 2022, we have multiple opportunities for growth across our portfolio with our recently launched product, Opzelura in atopic dermatitis, Pemazyre in cholangiocarcinoma, Monjuvi and Minjuvi in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, and Jakafi in chronic GVHD. Later this year, we expect regulatory decisions in the U.S. and in Europe for cream in vitiligo, a disease that affects millions of patients and for whom there is no approved treatment for repigmentation.\nFor our partnered products with Novartis, ruxolitinib is under review in Europe and Japan for GVHD and capmatinib is under review in Europe for non-small cell lung cancer. Regulatory application were also submitted by for baricitinib in the U.S., Europe and Japan for alopecia areata. 2022 is a year full of important milestone where we will develop and expand our pipeline, deliver new data in key clinical program and continued driving uptake of our newly launched products and new indications.\nBefore handing the call over to Barry, I want to say a few words on the launch of Opzelura and our expanding footprint in dermatology. A few years ago, we expanded our development capabilities into dermatology with the intention to bring ruxolitinib cream to market. We were able to implement a robust and successful development program for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. And Opzelura became the first topical JAK inhibitor approved in atopic dermatitis in the U.S. and has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for repigmentation in vitiligo.\nAs you can see on the right, we have since expanded our dermatologic clinical development pipeline to include multiple products and indications. We also established a dedicated commercial organization in the U.S. to support the launch of Opzelura and these efforts have been translating into a very successful launch thus far. We expect our dermatology franchise to become an important growth driver for Incyte starting with Opzelura, which we believe can reach $1.5 billion in pixels in atopic dermatitis in the U.S. alone.\nAnd to share more details on Opzelura and Jakafi's performance and outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Barry.\n\nBarry P. Flannelly\n\nExecutive VP & GM of North America, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Hervé. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the performance of Opzelura thus far, and we are making significant progress with the launch on multiple fronts. Starting with the uptake of Opzelura. On the left-hand side is 867 data, which is number of units of Opzelura 60-gram tubes that our wholesalers are shipping to pharmacies. These data tied closely to prescriptions dispensed given the low level of inventory retail pharmacies typically hold for specialty dermatology products. .\nIn the fourth quarter, since launching on October 11, nearly 21,000 units have been shipped to pharmacies. And in the month of January, nearly 11,000 units have been shipped -- as you can see, the demand for Opzelura in recent weeks continues to climb and the trends are very encouraging. On the right-hand side is IQVIA data, showing new-to-brand share for Opzelura in our market basket, which includes DUPIXENT, EUCRISA, Protopic and Elidel and their generics.\nIn the 16th week since launch, as shown on the chart, Opzelura is capturing over 10% of all new-to-brand prescriptions after steroid failures. Not shown on this slide are the refills, which comprise 15% of the total Rxs as of the week ending January 28. The number of refills demonstrates the satisfaction that patients and physicians are experiencing and is a very positive indicator of the long-term potential of Opzelura.\nOn Slide 9. What further excites us about the launch is the very positive feedback we are receiving from physicians who are prescribing Opzelura, which is supported by the most recent survey conducted in the field. Prescribers were asked how many atopic dermatitis patients they prescribed Opzelura, too, for the first time in the past month. They were also asked how many new patients they expect to treat with Opzelura in the next month. Results showed that there is an increased willingness to prescribe Opzelura and physicians are highlighting the efficacy, specifically the rapid itch relief and skin clearance as well as the safety in a topical formulation as the top reasons for prescribing.\nThere are millions of AD patients living with uncontrolled disease in the U.S., and there is enthusiasm from both physicians and patients to try a new, nonsteroidal topical treatment with a novel mechanism of action, with the expectation that patients will be able to find relief of their AD symptoms.\nOn the payer front, I'm happy to report that contract negotiations have been progressing well. We now have base rebate agreements signed with 2 of the 3 largest GPOs. These agreements establish utilization management criteria and discount rates for approximately 55% of commercial lives covered under these 2 PBMs, For this non-NDC block business, PBMs and associated plans are now establishing policies to provide access to Opzelura. For the other 45% of covered lives under these 2 PBMs, we are in active contract negotiations to remove the new-to-market or NDC blocks. For the third PBM negotiations continue to advance. These are important steps towards gaining full coverage for Opzelura for the millions of patients whose prescription services are managed by these PBMs.\nTurning to Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, our patient support program covered the vast majority of prescriptions, where we covered the full cost of Opzelura from many patients. As the coverage for Opzelura improves, the utilization of this specific program will decrease and will lead to an improvement in gross to net. Our co-pay mitigation program will continue and allow patients to lower their out-of-pocket cost to as little as $10.\nIn summary, the strong launch of Opzelura has been driven by several factors. The product has a unique profile unmatched by any other topical therapy for atopic dermatitis and we are launching into a market where there are millions of patients living with uncontrolled disease. Patients and physicians are reporting positive experience and are requesting refills, and this cycle is fueling much of the momentum behind the launch of Opzelura, which is on track to be a significant growth driver for Incyte.\nNow turning to Jakafi. In the fourth quarter, Jakafi grew 15% year-over-year to $592 million. Patient demand continues to drive the uptake of Jakafi with robust new patient growth across all indications. In GVHD, patient growth was up 28% for the full year and up 39% in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the launch in the chronic setting and the transition of GVHD patients from our expanded access program to commercial product. We expect growth of new patients to continue into 2022 and for the full year net product revenues to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. This guidance range takes into account the newly launched indication in chronic GVHD and the continued recovery of new patient starts.\nAnd lastly, on Monjuvi, Minju and Pemazyre. Monjuvi sales in Q4 were $24 million. We continue to make progress with penetration into key accounts and increasing uptake of Monjuvi in the second-line setting. Full year guidance for 2022 of $110 million to $135 million were net product sales as recorded by MorphoSys takes into consideration a continuation of the momentum in Q4, new account penetration and impact from COVID. Minjuvi, which was approved in Europe in August of last year and was launched in Germany, net sales in the fourth quarter were $4 million. While it is still very early, we are encouraged by the initial uptake and expect Minjuvi to become a meaningful growth contributor as we continue to gain reimbursement in other European countries.\nPemazyre grew to $69 million in net sales in 2021, with $10 million coming from outside the U.S. In the U.S., new patient starts continue to grow with duration of therapy likely to drive performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.\n\nSteven H. Stein\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Medical Officer, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. In 2021, we made significant progress across our development pipeline with multiple clinical and regulatory achievements. We announced 4 product approvals that include Jakafi in the United States for chronic graft-versus-host disease. Monjuvi in Europe for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Pemazyre in Europe and Japan for cholangiocarcinoma, and most recently, Opzelura in the United States for atopic dermatitis.\nFurther on the regulatory side, ruxolitinib cream is under review at both the FDA and EMA for vitiligo. Throughout the year, we delivered key clinical highlights as listed on the right, which include positive Phase III data for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo and the initiation of a Phase III study evaluating parsaclisib in autoimmune hemolytic anemia following positive Phase II results. We also signed a collaborative agreement with Syndax for axatilimab in chronic graft-versus-host disease, which granted us the right to develop axatilimab as a monotherapy following treatment with Jakafi or in combination with the JAK inhibitor earlier in the treatment paradigm. And we shared data from our oral PD-L1 program, where we've demonstrated for the first time ever clinical activity with an oral PD-L1 inhibitor.\nMoving to Slide 16. As I mentioned, the sNDA for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo was accepted for priority review by the U.S. FDA, with a PDUFA action date of April 18. Vitiligo represents another significant opportunity for our growing dermatology franchise. In the United States, there are currently 1.5 million people living with vitiligo and only 150,000 to 200,000 patients currently seek treatment due to a lack of effective treatment options. The quality of life for some patients with vitiligo can be poor, with 1 in 4 patients reporting depression and 1 in 7 reporting anxiety due to their disease. Many vitiligo patients experience psychological, social and the physical impacts of vitiligo and represent the true unmet need where they may benefit from a new approved agent, like ruxolitinib cream.\nNow to look more broadly at our dermatology franchise on Slide 17. Within our expanding dermatology portfolio, we are pursuing multiple additional indications with ruxolitinib cream, including pediatric atopic dermatitis and chronic hand eczema. INCB54707, our JAK1 specific inhibitor, has been evaluated in vitiligo in patients with larger body surface area of involvement greater than or equal to 8%, and is also in Phase II studies for higher adenitis to protiva and in prurigo nodularis. We expect results from the vitiligo and HS trial in the second half of this year. There is significant potential with each of these indications where there are limited treatment options, in some cases, no FDA-approved treatments.\nSlide 18 shows the opportunity for growth across our portfolio in MPNs and graft versus host disease. We expect an NDA submission in the first half of this year for once-daily ruxolitinib. Within myelofibrosis, we have multiple strategies focusing on improving upon the standard of care by either addressing efficacy or safety. In patients who have an inadequate response to a single agent JAK inhibitor combination therapy has the potential to improve efficacy, which we are pursuing through the addition of parsaclisib or a BET inhibitor. Our Phase III program evaluating ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib in inadequate responders and in the first-line setting for myelofibrosis is ongoing, and we expect results in 2023 for the suboptimal study.\nFor patients who are on subtherapeutic doses due to anemia, these patients may benefit from the addition of an ALK2 inhibitor. We know that Jakafi has been a life-changing therapy for many patients with MF and PV. And we believe we can use our expertise in this area to provide additional options to patients. We continue to work towards addressing the unmet need in patients with graft-versus-host disease with Jakafi and other therapies including itacitinib, a JAK1 selective inhibitor, being evaluated in treatment-naive patients with chronic graft versus host disease. And as previously mentioned, axatilamab as monotherapy and potentially in combination with the JAK inhibitor.\nTurning to Slide 19. A number of updates are expected this year for some of our earlier stage pipeline. We expect updated data from our oral PD-L1 program later this year, which could allow us to make decisions on indication and a lead program selection. Additionally, we expect data from the adenosine program for both our small molecule A2A, A2B antagonist and our CD73 monoclonal antibody later this year. As you can see on Slide 20, we're expecting multiple regulatory and clinical catalysts this year, and we look forward to another very exciting year ahead.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.\n\nChristiana Stamoulis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Incyte Corporation\n\nThank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product and royalty revenues of $813 million, representing an increase of 20% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and reflecting growth across products commercialized by Incyte and by our partners.\nTotal product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $592 million for Jakafi, $51 million for other hematology/oncology products and $5 million for Opzelura, royalties from Novartis of $96 million for Jakafi and $3 million for TABRECTA and royalties from Lilly of $66 million for OLUMIANT. This 15% year-over-year growth for Jakafi net product sales reflects higher air patient demand across all indications.\nThe doubling of OLUMIANT royalties is driven primarily by the use of OLUMIANT for the treatment of COVID-19. As a reminder, for global net sales of OLUMIANT for the treatment of COVID-19, we are entitled to receive royalty sequel to the base double-digit royalties applicable to all global net product sales, plus an additional 13% royalty. For the full year 2021, total product and royalty revenues were $2.9 billion and a 17% increase over 2020.\nFocusing now on Opzelura for the fourth quarter, the launch and volume of prescriptions has been strong. While we are negotiating with PBMs and payers to get Opzelura formularies and remove the NDC blocks, we have been utilizing patient and support programs to cover the full cost of Opzelura so that patients have access to the product. In the fourth quarter, Opzelura gross product sales of $58 million were reduced by 75% related to these patient support programs. In addition, other fees and discounts of 17% contributed to a total gross to net discount of 92% for the quarter. As a result of these reductions, net product sales for the quarter were $5 million.\nMoving on to the -- our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $345 million for the fourth quarter decreased 9% from the prior year period, primarily due to the ruxolitinib cream API-related costs incurred in the prior year quarter before Opzelura's regulatory approval. Ongoing R&D expense for the full year 2021 of $1.3 billion increased by 6% over 2020, primarily due to the progression of our pipeline.\nTotal R&D expense of $473 million for the quarter and $1.46 billion for the full year 2021 includes upfront consideration of $127 million for our collaborative agreement with Simdax. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter of $226 million increased 35% and from the prior year period, primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of our new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura. For the full year 2021, the 43% growth in SG&A expense was also primarily related to the commercialization of Opzelura. Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $8 million, representing our 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. For the full year 2021, the total collaboration loss was $37 million.\nFinally, we ended the year with $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Looking at the evolution of our P&L, you can see how over the past 3 years, the growth in our product and royalty revenues has exceeded the growth in our ongoing R&D and SG&A expenses, leading to increased operating leverage and reflecting our commitment to prudent management of our financial resources. As previously discussed, the uptick in expenses in 2021 reflects the build-out of our dermatology franchise and the Opzelura launch.\nMoving on to 2022. I will now discuss the components of our guidance on a GAAP basis. For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, which at the midpoint represents an increase of approximately 10% over 2021 and driven by continued growth across all indications. We expect our gross to net adjustment for 2022 to be approximately 21%, reflecting expected continued growth in 340B volumes. As a reminder, the gross to net adjustments in the first quarter of the year is always higher relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients.\nFor other hematology/oncology products, which includes Pemazyre in the U.S., EU and Japan and Iclusig and Minjuvi in Europe, we are expecting total net product revenues to be in the range of $210 million to $240 million, which at midpoint represents approximately 23% growth over 2021. Due to the early stage of its launch, we will not be providing guidance on Opzelura, but I will provide some additional color around Opzelura gross to net for 2022 in a moment. As in previous years, we are also not providing guidance for milestones or royalty revenues.\nTurning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis, we expect COGS to range from 6% to 7% of product revenues. R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.59 billion, representing 18% growth at the midpoint versus 2021, excluding the impact of the Simdax upfront consideration in 2021. The growth rate primarily reflects expansion in our dermatology clinical development as well as investments in our LIMBER GVHD program, tafacitamab and our PD-L1 program.\nWe expect SG&A expense for the year to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion, primarily reflecting continued support for the Opzelura launch. Excluding the impact of Opzelura-related cost, we expect SG&A expense to grow at a rate of less than 5%. With respect to our profit share for Monjuvi in the U.S., in 2022, we expect to be around breakeven.\nAs I previously mentioned, while we are not providing guidance for Opzelura due to the early stage of the launch, I would like to discuss what you could expect related to our gross to net adjustment in 2022. As we finalize coverage with payers, we expect gross to net for Opzelura to be relatively flat in Q1 compared to Q4 2021, begin to decline in Q2 and normalize at a fully loaded gross to net rate of 40% to 50% between Q3 and Q4, depending on the timing of the removal of NDC blocks by PBMs and the discontinuation of certain patient support programs.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.",

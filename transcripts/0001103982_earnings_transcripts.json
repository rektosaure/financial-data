In order to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone at any time during the call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel?z. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mondel?z International\n\nWith me today are Dirk Vandeput, our Chairman and CEO, and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted.\nYou can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide four. I'm pleased to share that we delivered solid results for Q1, driven by sound execution despite significant external volatility. Our top line grew 3.1% behind strong pricing execution across our chocolate business due to unprecedented input costs for cocoa. We also delivered strong profit dollar generation and free cash flow. These results, along with solid category growth, reinforce our continued confidence in our full-year outlook.\nWe remain committed to delivering against our strategic agenda, focusing on the controllables, and staying agile in this challenging macro environment. We are continuing to execute with excellence against our chocolate strategy and our cost savings program. Both of these initiatives are on track and will provide additional color throughout today's call. Turning to slide five, you can see that organic net revenue grew 3.1%. Volume mix was down 3.5 points due to elasticity, consistent with our expectations. We also implemented planned activities in our chocolate business. A few one-time factors also affected volume mix, which included Easter phasing, and retailer inventory restocking, which Luca will describe in more detail later. Pricing execution related to cocoa inflation was strong. We have now implemented planned pricing across many key markets with minimal disruption. We also saw a successful start to the Easter season.\nAs expected, adjusted gross profit was significantly impacted by record cocoa costs, and consequently, this also affected our EPS. We also generated $800 million in free cash flow in the quarter. On slide six, you can see that consumers' enduring preference for our snacking categories remains solid, despite continuing economic and political concerns in many markets. In North America, continued frustration with day-to-day pricing and cost of living challenges continues to drive value-seeking behavior. As a result, growth in the biscuit category is soft, but it continues to hold up better than many other snacking categories. Despite overall declining consumer confidence, loyalty to our strong brands like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, and Ritz remains solid, and our investment in price-pack architecture is helping to drive continued share gains. Meanwhile, in Europe, consumer confidence and price elasticities remain stable.\nWe continue to see solid category value growth in both biscuits and chocolate, and our brands continue to resonate with consumers. Elasticity also remains stable in emerging markets. However, consumer confidence is soft in Brazil, Mexico, and China from economic uncertainty, while confidence in India remains solid. Overall, we're seeing solid category growth in both volume and value across our combined emerging markets, and Mondel?z's share is improving in both biscuits and chocolate. Turning to slide seven, it is important to reinforce that we're continuing to make progress against our strategic growth agenda: reinvesting in our brands, expanding distribution, strengthening our marketing and sales capabilities, and scaling our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Here are just a few highlights of our strategy in action.\nOur iconic global brands, including Oreo and Cadbury Dairy Milk, continue to drive creative on-trend activations that resonate strongly with consumers and help strengthen our strategic partnerships with retailers. For example, Oreo's collaboration with Post Malone marked the first time a pop culture figure was personally involved in building a recipe for Oreo nearly from scratch, resulting in our first-ever twisted cream. Meanwhile, in the UK, we rolled out our first of many chocolate collaborations, resulting from the partnership with Lotus Bakeries. The Cadbury Dairy Milk Biscoff Bar, featuring the signature Biscoff taste and crunch, is only the beginning of our innovation platform, with our other chocolate brands rolling out similar Biscoff crumbles and flavors across Europe in the coming months. Along with these creative brand reinvestments, we continue to expand distribution around the world. We added more than 100,000 stores in emerging markets in Q1.\nWe also are making significant progress in strengthening our partnership with retailers around the world. For the first time in our history, we achieved a top-tier ranking on the Global Advantage Survey. Additionally, we continue to make strong progress towards building a more sustainable snacking company and delivered on all our 24 sustainability targets. Earlier this month, we published our annual Snacking Made Right Report, providing stakeholders an in-depth view of our sustainability strategy, goals, and performance data. Among other highlights, we expanded Cocoa Life, our signature sustainability program, to source 91% of cocoa volume for our chocolate business. We also made meaningful strides in combating climate change, reducing end-to-end carbon emissions by 12% versus our 2018 baseline. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale across the communities our business touches is an integral part of value creation.\nSimply put, we believe that more sustainable businesses, and always will be, is good business. I encourage you to take a few minutes to review our report in more detail. Before I turn the microphone over to Luca, I'd like to reinforce that our chocolate strategy remains on track, and performance to date is broadly in line with our expectations. Our teams started planning for the challenges created by record cocoa input cost inflation more than a year ago, and we're confident that the robust, clear strategy we built to navigate these conditions is paying off. We have reconfigured our chocolate portfolio to offer consumers an array of pack sizes appropriate for each snacking occasion, from bite-sized treats offering a delicious taste of meantime to family sizes designed for sharing with family and friends. At the same time, we continue to maintain entry-level pricing to drive consumption.\nWe also have successfully implemented most of our planned pricing in Europe with minimal customer disruption. As a result, elasticity is in line with expectations. We're also growing share in chocolate across markets, up 0.4 points year-to-date. We continue to innovate with new flavors, formats, and brand activations. Year in and year out, consumers around the world show us that our iconic chocolates are an essential part of their seasonal celebrations like Valentine's Day and Easter. We're continuing to stay a step ahead of their changing taste with exciting new products, including the delicious co-branded tablets I mentioned before, featuring the unique caramelized Biscoff flavor and crunch. In short, we remain confident that our strong chocolate franchise is positioned for long-term success.\nOur robust playbook is working, and we remain convinced that it will enable us to not only navigate the current cocoa cost challenge, but more importantly, to drive category health for the long term. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q1 marked another quarter of top-line growth for our business, despite some external challenges and lower consumer confidence. For Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth, while profit dollar generation was better than expected. Free Cash Flow continued to be strong. Revenue grew 3.1%, behind strong pricing execution across our chocolate business. Volume mix was down 3.5% due to elasticity from chocolate pricing, transitory trade destocking with flat consumption in the US, planned outsizing activities in chocolate to protect price points, as well as some Easter phasing.\nDeveloped markets grew 2.6%, primarily due to strong pricing execution, with a Volume Mix decline of 3.3% on the back of retailer destocking and some chocolate elasticity. Total revenue for emerging markets grew 3.9%, with a Volume Mix decline of 3.7%. EM results were driven by strength in Brazil, China, and the majority of the Middle East and Africa businesses. We experienced some softness in India and Southeast Asia. Moving to portfolio performance on slide 11, biscuits and baked snacks grew 0.3% for the quarter. Brands delivering growth included LU, 7Days, Prince, Club Social, Perfect Snacks, and Grenade. However, we saw softer-than-expected results in our US biscuit business, driven by retailer destocking, which resulted in approximately 60 basis points volume headwind to the total company and 250 basis points for total North American volumes.\nAdditionally, our US biscuit business experienced lower consumption, driven by ongoing consumer confidence declines, resulting in lower frequency and value-seeking behavior. Chocolate grew by 10.1%, with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was down 5.7%, driven by elasticities that were in line with our expectations, along with RGM and product outsizing activities across the chocolate portfolio that accounted for almost three points of decline. Brand growth was broad-based across global and local brands, with Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta, Côte d'Or, Freia, Marabou, and Toblerone all posting strong results. Gum and candy grew 1%, driven by gum in China and Mexico, as well as both gum and candy in Western India. Volume mix was challenged because of trade destocking in the US, as well as some issues in Mexico. Let's review market share performance on slide 12.\nWe held or gained share in approximately 7% of our revenue base, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits. Category growth numbers are clearly underestimated because of chocolate Easter phasing versus last year. A more normalized number would put total category growth at around 3%. Category growth is due to accelerate as more pricing for chocolate kicks in. Turning to regional performance on slide 13, Europe grew 8.9% in Q1. Execution and growth were excellent in the quarter, and several key countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, delivered robust growth. Pricing execution related to cocoa inflation was strong, coupled with a successful start to the Easter season and share gains. Volume declines were driven by elasticity levels consistent with our expectation and RGM activities associated with our chocolate strategy. We have successfully landed chocolate pricing for the key alliances in line with our expectation.\nWe can now focus on driving demand and expect positive developments in Europe for the remainder of the year. OI dollars were down approximately 26% due to unprecedented levels of cocoa inflation. North America declined 3.6% due primarily to retailer destocking in the US, as well as softer consumer demand, most notably within the food and mass channel. This dynamic remains consistent with the overall market and is driven primarily by less frequency from lower-income households. Given we gained share, our total consumption was pretty much flat. We are continuing to sharpen our offers, such as recently introduced Fresh Stacks, which have shown good momentum, along with improved in-store execution and increased distribution to drive improved results as we move through the year. North America OI decreased by 18% due to lower volume and cocoa inflation from our Canadian chocolate business, but also for the US biscuit.\nAMIA grew 1.8% for the quarter. China delivered another strong quarter with mid-single-digit volume-led growth driven by focused initiatives around Oreo, Chips Ahoy, and Stride. India declined high single digits, lapping a strong prior year as overall consumption was challenged by inflationary pressures and wage growth. We do expect to improve the trajectory of the India business beginning in Q2 through targeted activation, distribution gains, and an improving macro backdrop resulting from income tax relief and recently enacted interest rate cuts. Australia, New Zealand, and Japan delivered another strong quarter with mid-single-digit top-line growth due to strong Easter execution and pricing. AMIA OI dollars declined 8.3% due to materially higher cocoa prices that were partially offset by pricing and cost discipline. Latin America grew 3.9% with solid pricing execution and a volume mix decline of 2.5%.\nBrazil posted mid-single-digit growth with strong chocolate and biscuits that was partially offset by weaker powdered beverage results. Mexico grew low single digits with growth in biscuits, chocolate, and gum, while candy was down. The Mexican economy is showing signs of slowing, which we are continuing to monitor and factor into our plans. Latin America OI declined 12.4% due largely to increased cocoa inflation. Turning to page 14 and a few notes on volume mix dynamics in Q1. Although overall volume mix was down 3.5%, it is important to separate what is one-time or planned versus underlying. US trade destocking and seasonal phasing around Easter account for roughly 1.3 percentage points, or roughly 40% of that decline, while package downsizing accounted for another point of lower volume.\nOn the flip side, EU customer disruption was lower than planned and last year, bringing us closer to an underlying decline of approximately 2%. We expect the US destocking dynamic to partially continue into Q2, while Easter phasing will be favorable next quarter. Turning to page 15, in Q1, we saw a decline of 12% in gross profit dollar terms. Solid top-line growth and cost efficiency partially offset significant cocoa inflation. Our view of cocoa inflation is unchanged for the remainder of the year and is embedded into our full-year outlook. Next to EPS on slide 16, Q1 EPS declined 18% in constant currency. Turning to slide 17 and cash flow and capital return, we delivered $800 million of free cash flow for the quarter. We repurchased $1.5 billion in stock at an average price of $57.91.\nBefore moving to our outlook, let me provide a few thoughts on cocoa. Although cocoa prices remain quite elevated relative to historical averages, both spot rates and future curves have declined since our Q4 call. We continue to expect a small surplus for the year. In addition, we continue to see volume declines from an industry perspective due to elasticities associated with inflation-driven pricing and outsizing activities, while nonchocolate players who traditionally use cocoa as an ingredient continue to reformulate with alternative components at a fraction of the cost. We believe at these levels, meaningful demand declines are expectable and will accelerate, and that eventually will reflect on cocoa prices. Having said that, we remain confident in our pricing and RGM strategy and will continue to stay agile as the situation demands.\nTurning to our outlook on slide 20, our outlook for 2025 remains unchanged for organic revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow. This includes approximately 5% revenue growth, which reflects successful customer negotiation and pricing in Europe, as well as a softer demand environment in the US. Most of our key assumptions remain consistent with what we shared with you on our last call. We are reaffirming inflation levels, interest, and tax costs, as well as share repurchases. Translation forex impacts have changed, and we are now expecting no impact on net revenue and EPS from foreign currency for the year. This reflects the dollar weakening against several currencies since our last call, including the euro and sterling. However, given dollar volatility, this could rapidly change. With respect to tariffs, the vast majority of US production is sourced from the US or is USMCA compliant.\nHowever, there is some sourcing of finished goods and ingredients that are subject to tariffs as things stand today. Although not particularly large, these are incremental to our last call and have been factored into our current earnings outlook. Before Q&A, a few words on 2026. We remain focused on running a balanced P&L for 2025 while continuing to maintain a sound chocolate business and category for the long term. The early results have been positive as it relates to our chocolate strategy. We continue to invest behind our business while cost-saving initiatives remain on target. It is early to provide specifics on 2026, but we still expect EPS growth for next year. Although cocoa prices have come down recently, they remain elevated.\nIt is also important to note that if we do see further improvement in cocoa, we will likely reinvest a portion of that saving back into the business. With that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star 2. Once again, that is Star 1 to ask a question. We'll go first to Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Maybe, Dirk, just to start it off, it'd be great to get maybe a bit more detail on sort of trends and some key regions as we think about sort of the year to go from here.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYep, yep. Thanks, Andrew. Well, I would say that, first of all, despite the changes that we see in the external environment, that we feel pretty good about the start of the year and our results. I would note a few positives which will impact the rest of the year that happened during Q1. First of all, we had some major negotiations to do in Europe to announce the price increases and get approval for the price increases on our chocolate business. They passed virtually all of them with minimal disruption this year. Then, if you look at how our chocolate business is doing, particularly in Europe, the pricing is on track, as I just said. We have some very good activations. We've implemented a number of RGM activities. Easter came through quite well.\nSo, Easter, we will see more in the Q2 results, and Q1 was affected because of the Easter phasing, which was late this year. But we can already see that Easter will be very good for us. And, for instance, note that we had some strong share gains in the UK. Our emerging markets continue to perform well. Particularly, I would mention here China and Brazil. And in times like this, where the North American market is probably the most affected market, it's good to have this geographical diversification. And on top, we're gaining share in many markets around the world. Having said all that, I think the one thing that you've seen probably from many companies is that North America was clearly softer than what we would have expected. I think many people have talked about the retail destocking, and we expect that that will be less in Q2.\nThe biscuit category is soft. We see consumers switching to more essentials in grocery, and snacking categories are suffering as a consequence of that. But biscuit, overall, compared to other snacking categories, is doing better and on top of gaining share in the category. So we've got a number of good percent takes in the quarter. We feel very good about our full-year outlook. If I look a little bit at what's going on around the world, I would say the consumer sentiment is quite mixed, and that's driven by overall global macroeconomic uncertainty. Probably where we saw the biggest effect on the consumer was in the US, where the consumer confidence declined sharply in Q1, and it declined another 11% in April. That's all driven by inflation fears. People see their income slowing. We see that the prioritizing of essentials, which is pressurizing snacking.\nWe see a shift to value club and e-com channels. We're seeing more promotional pressure. Largely, lower-income consumers are shifting to smaller packs, while higher-income consumers are shifting to larger packs for value. In the middle of all that, the biscuit category declined 1.5% in value, but it outperformed other snack categories, as said. Cookies is doing better than crackers. Private label grew a little bit. We gained about 0.3 points of share. I think that was driven largely by the fact that we launched a number of affordable formats, which we call Fresh Stacks, which are under $3. And I think we are seeing that offering compelling value to consumers really matters at this stage. I have to say that I really do not expect to see a significant improvement in the consumer confidence in the near term in the US, that is.\nIn Europe, I would say consumer confidence is, in general, stable. They are aware of the global trade volatility, and it's impacting their purchasing behavior. They're probably switching to more frugal spending and also prioritizing essentials. We see a bit more shopping frequency, going to smaller pack sizes, and also a shift in channels in Europe that is more to discounters and e-commerce. We see an increase in promotions. In the middle of all that, with the price increases we're implementing, chocolate is performing in line to expectations, i.e., the elasticities that we're seeing are in line around 0.5. Easter was later this year, so if you include it in Q2, I think we will see a nice Q2. Biscuit is performing well, particularly in France for us. So we feel pretty confident about our European business. We see a resilient consumer. We landed the negotiations.\nWe had a good Easter. Biscuits are doing well. So we expect our European business to continue to do well. And on the emerging market, I would say the consumer is softer because they are suffering from inflation. They see the trade volatility. The Chinese consumer remains quite subdued, 20-year low, I would say, but our business is doing well. The Indian consumer is stable. There is more optimism this year. People see income growth, jobs. And then Brazil and Mexico, clearly in both places, the consumer is softer, more outspoken in Mexico than in Brazil, of course, because of the economic uncertainty and the persistent inflation. I would say our categories in emerging markets are stable. We have gained share, but we have to remain agile in all regions of the world.\nI would say so far, so good, but it's still a long year, and we will need to stay very vigilant about shifts that we see at the level of the consumer.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nGreat. That's really helpful detail. Thanks so much for that. And maybe Luca could just briefly keep what's at stake to keep in mind for the year to go, particularly around North America and pricing in Europe. Thanks so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. Hi, Andrew. So I think as far as 2025 guidance goes, I think for us, it's a great thing that we are reaffirming our plan. We feel quite good at this point in time, but as you said, there are puts and takes. I think Dirk already mentioned among the positives the customer negotiation, which I would say is a pure upside versus last year because last year we had some disruption. This year, we don't. But in general, I would also say that pricing across the board, whether it is chocolate in developed and emerging markets or biscuits in emerging markets specifically, it is absolutely on track. And our RGM agenda is clearly improving the situation on elasticity in both chocolate and in biscuit. As we said, elasticities are quite good at this point in time.\nSo that's an assumption that is key for us to be able to deliver on and potentially over-deliver on the top line in the year to go. Importantly, this season was quite strong. Dirk mentioned Europe, but I'm happy to report that we gained meaningful share in Brazil and in Australia. We are very happy there. Biscuits is holding up well outside of North America. We have positive volume mix in the category. Clearly, there are some cost upside versus our original plan. As we mentioned, the overall tariffs is causing a small and manageable impact. Those are, I would say, the positives that we see continuing into the second part of the year in Q2 as well. Among the things that didn't play out as we planned, it is clearly the consumer sentiment in the US impacting our categories.\nBiscuits as a category, despite being soft, is faring better than other snacks, and we are winning share. When you put both the market dynamics and the share, actually our consumption in Q1 is likely down. So I think that given some of the numbers we have seen published by others, I think it is, relatively speaking in terms, a good thing. Trade stocking is a one-time impact. You saw that it is meaningful. It is 2.5 to 3 points of volume mix in the US. And we assume that it is non-recoverable in the year to go. I think particularly as we enter into Q2, you will see an acceleration of top line and volume mix. And I think that's clearly a testament to what the teams are doing.\nAll considered, you might not expect anything differently at this point in time, but we are retaining some flexibility within the plan. So should things worsen in the US, I think we have what it takes to deliver both top and bottom line, but also bear in mind that if we have earnings upside, we will be reinvesting in the business as we are trying to enter 2026 from a stronger position. We remain disciplined on capital allocation. We will continue to buy back stock in a sensible manner. As you might have seen, we were active buyers in Q1 at what I believe are very compelling prices. So very happy on that front too.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nHi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about your strategy to mitigate cocoa inflation. It's obviously multifaceted, right, with productivity, RGM, and, of course, pricing. And you touched on your success in these elements during your prepared remarks. But what I really wanted to dig in a little bit on is the balance between them ahead. And I guess the question in particular is, with pricing having gone, I don't want to say better than expected, but it sure seems like it, and elasticity in line, is there a possibility you can maybe be a little bit less aggressive on RGM or maybe some other actions than you were planning? Or is really the message just, \"Hey, our overall mitigation efforts are going quite well, and it's full steam ahead in all areas\"? Just wanted to get a better sense of all of those.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. Yeah. Good question, Ken. So yeah, you phrased it right. So our strategy basically was, of course, first of all, have a great execution of what we designed, but we designed at the core a very aggressive RGM strategy. And that doesn't necessarily mean all downsizing. It means that we will offer a whole range of pack sizes to the consumer. And so the consumer certainly has many more options as it relates to the price points they would like to buy our products. And then we are trying to get some very strong activation. So Easter was the first step, but there's a number of others to come during the year. Easter, I would say, was a success. That's the second leg of our chocolate strategy. And the third leg is to come up with new products, new and unique products that draw the consumer into the category.\nThe launch in this Q1 was the Cadbury Biscoff product. That is, at the moment, our number one selling SKU in the UK. More is to come in that front. So we will launch in several more markets in the coming months that Biscoff varietal. And then later in the year, we will have a number of new innovations under that Cadbury Biscoff or Milka Biscoff franchise. The other thing we're doing as part of that strategy is protect key price points. So if there is a low unit price point in India, for instance, we're maintaining that at INR five and 10. We are also very carefully making sure that we don't break any thresholds in developed markets. So the big question is what's going to happen once that all hits the market.\nPricing has gone well in the sense that we finished the negotiations with our client, and we have implemented pricing, i.e., the consumer is seeing the pricing in a number of markets, but it's very early days. We see a little bit more in Scandinavia, for instance, or in the UK, where we went ahead earlier with the pricing, but countries like Germany or France are now hitting the market. Australia did some at the end of last year, but is doing more in May. So it's still to be seen what the reaction is going to be. What I can say so far from a consumer perspective is that the elasticity is around 0.5, which is exactly in line with what we would have expected.\nBut we want to continue to monitor very closely, and we don't want to start saying, \"Okay, this worked great.\" We will have to see how the consumer is reacting. The good news of all of this is that we gained share in volume and value. Share overall, our tablets are up, of course, double digits, as you can imagine with some of the pricing. Easter, as I said, is very good. The word that I would use is so far so good, but we are not done yet. We have a long road ahead. The macro conditions are very volatile. As I said, the European consumer is stable at the moment, but that could change. We still have to very carefully monitor the consumer reactions, which, by the way, are very different from country to country.\nWe need to sort of direct our reactions depending on what we see happening. On the long term, I think we're seeing the signs that we believe in the chocolate market, which is that in the end, consumers love chocolate. They will probably grapple a little bit with the current price increases. But over the long term, I think the high penetration of chocolate will continue. I think we will continue to see very strong brand loyalty. We have the taste of the nation brands in many markets. I don't think consumers will walk away from that. And there is very low cross-substitution happening. If you don't have your chocolate, there are not really that many other products you can go to that give you the same satisfaction and indulgence, I would say. We also, as Luca mentioned, we want to take a long-term approach here.\nSo if we have any upside, we want to reinvest particularly in our chocolate business. We don't want to take any shortcuts for short-term gains. We are very focused on the long-term health of the category as well as our business. And it's all going to depend where cocoa goes in the rest of the year and where cocoa will be next year. But if it stays at the high level it currently is, we might need to implement more RGM in the second half of the year or the beginning of next year. So agility is going to be key going forward, but so far so good, as I said.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you so much. I'll pass it on.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nAnalyst, BofA Securities\n\nHey, guys. Good afternoon. Luca, thanks for the clarity on tariffs. I think one of the wire services maybe picked up your commentary wrong, so I appreciate the clarifications there. Luca, maybe just to start, I wanted to ask, the slides you gave, I believe it's 11 and 12, that kind of show the Easter timing shift in chocolate. I guess if we had accounted for that, it would even imply that maybe elasticity was a bit better than you even planned for, just taking into account that shift. So I just wanted to understand if that's a fair way to think about it, given you had kind of a volume push-out with the pricing you put in, maybe versus first glance that the elasticity in chocolate might actually be more favorable than you had planned.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nI think in Q1, it has been a little bit more favorable. Having said that, pricing that is getting into effect in Europe, Brazil, and India is kicking in as of April, May, and June. That is the moment I think we'll be able to tell you for sure that elasticities are in line with our expectations. So Easter was priced up compared to last year, but there is more pricing coming into effect into the P&L in Q2. So you will see an acceleration of the revenue growth in Q2. I can tell you that Easter year on year is a meaningful driver of growth for us.\nAs I mentioned, we were quite happy despite the price increases that Easter volume held up well in three major countries, namely Europe, with the UK a clear standout in terms of share, but also Brazil and Australia. So, so far so good, I would say. Hopefully, we get positively surprised. It's important to say that in both big countries like Brazil and India, we are protecting key price points. So hopefully, the elasticity will be minimal also going forward.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And Dirk, maybe just as a follow-up, one question we got on the North America destocking, just given that you do operate a DSD system in the US, it would be, I guess, less common that we would expect that to happen. So just curious if you can give more color, either whether it's by channel, was it club, where you're maybe in more of a warehouse model where the destocking is happening, just any additional thoughts on kind of what the real driver is just relative to what we would maybe see historically. Thanks very much.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes. Yes. I would say we see it mostly in food and mass. Even if we have DSD there, the retailers still work with some stock in the back of the store. And they have an influence on what the level is, and they manage that through their orders. So we have a benefit in the execution that we do DSD, but the ordering still is quite directed by the centralized approach. So I would say it's more pronounced in food and mass. And DSD really doesn't help us because of the reasons that I just gave you.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nGot it. Thanks very much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Megan Alexander with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMegan Christine Alexander\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks so much. First question, Luca, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the profit dollar generation in the quarter was a bit better than you expected. So part A, just wondered if you could expand a bit on what drove that. And part B, a bit related. Last time on your fourth quarter call, I think you mentioned profit would be more pressured in Q1 with sequential improvement. Just wanted to clarify, is that still the case? It does seem like there's some incremental tariff costs. And while you mentioned not large, just want to see if it changes how we should think about the cadence of the rest of the year. Thank you.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. Thank you for your question. The upside came essentially through three lines, I would say. There was a little bit of better pricing, excluding the US, where you saw that pricing was likely negative. We had to reinvest some trade deals. But in general, pricing is a little bit better than what we had planned. So, not an impact, I would say, in the quarters to come, but a little bit of an upside in Q1. The second element is productivities. We are delivering on our productivity, and we are ahead of schedule. There was a comprehensive pipeline specifically around procurement-related productivities. And I think the team has done a very good job in delivering those productivities ahead of schedule. Again, not a material upside in the quarters to come, but certainly a timing upside as we have accelerated the delivery.\nThe third element is a little bit on the commodity side. We were able to obtain some commodities at favorable prices, and that has resulted in some margin upside. So in terms of cadence, we are clearly happy where we are at this point in time. I can't rule out the fact that there will be maybe a little bit more pressure going forward from tariffs. The direct impact to Mondel?z is really minimal and manageable. You can imagine that we are at this point in time not only with sufficient stock to most likely go through Q2 and Q3 in terms of those ingredients that are impacted. But importantly, we are sitting down with suppliers and trying to negotiate a more benign impact than we see. That impact is going to get into the P&L in Q4, specifically in North America as a driver.\nBut in the big scheme of things, I would say not a major deal and something that most likely we'll be able to manage through several things that we are working on. Cadence-wise, I remind you that percentage margins in this context are quite misleading. I think you saw that pricing in chocolate is up meaningfully. Total revenue was up 10%. So percentage margins, as we price away absolute dollars, will get diluted. But importantly, as we mentioned many, many times, we will be looking at chocolate margin per kilo as we exit 2025. And if we have done a good job in managing elasticities, I think we will have a very good situation in terms of profitability at the end of the year in terms of GP dollars. And that will put us in a good position to grow earnings into 2026.\n\nMegan Christine Alexander\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. That's really helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for you, Dirk, on biscuits in the US. Clearly, probably a theme that we've heard and will continue to hear throughout the earnings season as it relates to softness in the US. But you have made a lot of progress over the last couple of quarters on your share. But at the same time, you're a category leader. So just wondering if you could expand a bit about how you saw the quarter play out in the US, maybe what you've seen as we've moved through Easter, and whether you think there's further things you need to do to address just the category softness in particular. Thank you.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes. Yeah. So I think what's going on is that the consumer feels very uncertain about the future. As a consequence, they're trying to prioritize essential items. In food, those are essential food items like meat, vegetables, eggs, and so on. The more indulgent categories or the less essential categories that would include personal care items, that would include alcoholic beverages, that would include snacking categories are generating less interest at the moment. We saw that certainly play out in the first quarter. If you look at the snacking categories, I think almost all of them, except for yogurt, are down versus last year in volume. Within those, however, biscuits is doing, relatively speaking, better. It's not down as much as we saw.\nAs Luca explained for us as a company, if you exclude the destocking effect, we were slightly down in consumption, but almost flat in consumption. The way we are thinking about it is that, first of all, we need to hit the right price points. While two, three years ago, consumers would easily pay above $4 for a pack of biscuits, we're now seeing that we need to be below $4 and ideally below $3. So we've launched a number of packs that hit that $3 price point, below $3 price point. That certainly is having an effect for us. I think the other one that we see is that if we can run good activations and get extra displays, that also makes a difference. So going forward, we are planning on things like 4 July, Labor Day, really drive activation.\nWe've got some interesting Oreo activations coming up. For instance, we will launch a global Selena Gomez promotion in the coming months, and we think that will also make a difference. We did Post Malone at the beginning of the year, and that worked very well for us. The third thing I would say that we're trying to do in biscuits is push our multi-packs harder. That is for the consumer that tries to buy bigger packs to get a better value. And that is working also quite well for us. The destocking dynamic will subside, so that will help. And I think we have a bit of a chance that in the second half of the year, we will probably see a more positive volume growth environment in the biscuits category and for our business.\nSo focusing on the execution of the factors that I said, make sure we control the controllables. And I think we will see a gradually improving trajectory in the US.\n\nMegan Christine Alexander\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Megan.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\n\nChris Carey\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi everyone. Thanks so much. Luca, you made a comment around procuring commodities at slightly more favorable rates than what you thought. That struck me in the context of the commodity or the input inflation number in the quarter coming in a bit better than I expected per your filings. Do you think you're tracking better than your ongoing inflation expectations? Are there more opportunities to procure commodity a bit better than what you thought? I wonder if you could just expand a bit more on that.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. I think you saw overall the mark-to-market being negative. There have been adjustments not only for cocoa, but for other commodities. I would say we have been opportunistic, particularly in the way we have been locking in some minor commodities, I would say. At this point in time, though, we are pretty much done with covers for the year, so the prices are locked in. You might also imagine that given the exposure we have through currencies, given the Europe and the GBP material changes, we have been operating even in the forex exchange market and have taken advantage, particularly as there is a positive carry into 2026 and beyond with some of these currencies. We have not only operated for some minor commodities taking advantages, but also extended coverage of some of the forex pairs into 2026.\nI think when there is volatility, we are usually very good at grabbing some of the opportunities.\n\nChris Carey\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nPerfect. And then just one follow-up would be, you did mention that you would look to reinvest perhaps some back into your chocolate business. I don't know if that was a comment on pricing or other such investment if cocoa were to come down. Dirk talked about more RGM. I guess this is cocoa probably stays very volatile, and it's not sort of the core driver of your underlying business. But as this trends over time, what are kind of the key watch-outs? Say if cocoa were to go down and that's going to help your margins a lot, would you give some of that back in pricing? And you mentioned this concept of gross profit per kilo. And if it doesn't, do you continue to kind of lean in on RGM and perhaps reformulation?\nI know this is a topic that gets discussed quite a bit, but I would just love your latest thoughts in the context of kind of where we are in this cycle. Thanks so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. Thank you, Chris. So I would start by talking a little bit about the cocoa market and maybe on some of the fundamentals. I think we land this year with a total supply increase compared to last year that it is in the tune of 10%. I think on the flip side, though, demand, if you look at the total grindings, which is a proxy for consumption, I think Q1 grindings were down 3% to 4%. But I think the market is a little bit underestimating the true impact that is going to happen to the demand side of things, particularly as the biggest chocolate market, which is the US, is facing higher elasticity. I took a look a couple of days ago to the evolution of the market in the States, including Easter. I think there is a little bit of volume pressure.\nImportantly, what we are seeing, we travel to a few countries, and we see that those categories that utilize chocolate as a secondary ingredient are reformulating and downsizing heavily. I think you saw the impact that RGM had on our top line. I expect really the demand side to impact positively the future cost of cocoa. Our goal is to exit the year with minimal elasticity or elasticities in line with what we expected and with a GP dollar that makes sense because we truly believe that even if cocoa comes down, that will allow us, A, to expand gross profit dollar in absolute terms, and B, to reinvest materially back in the category.\nSo, if cocoa comes down, I think, quite frankly, it is nirvana for us because the level we will be priced to and the ability that cocoa lower prices will give us to reinvest in the business, considering that our share is up and that we are holding the line in terms of price points, particularly in emerging markets, I think, will position us well for the years to come. If cocoa stays high, quite frankly, I would say we don't expect, at this point in time, a material headwind into 2026. We talked to you about cocoa prices, but if I look, for instance, at cocoa butter, which is what we buy the most as opposed to cocoa powder, cocoa butter prices are already coming down for 2026. And so I think the market is anticipating some pressure on the volume side.\nAnd so, a long answer to say that, in either case, the plan is non-regrettable actions into 2025 and very well positioned at the end of 2025 to expand top and bottom line into 2026 for the chocolate category.\n\nChris Carey\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Luke.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our final question from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks for squeezing me in. The underperformance of snacks in the US, just even broader than your biscuits business and what you're involved in, it seems like it's a pretty large underperformance of the US market versus other markets around the world, and even in the US today versus past choppy economic environments. Do you think there's anything else ailing the US snacking market today other than consumer confidence and the low-income consumer? I have a quick follow-up.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International",
    "content2": "No, I don't necessarily think that. The reason being that it's across all categories in snacking, and there's many categories. There's ice cream, there is biscuits, there is packaged bakery, there's salted snacks, nuts, and so on. You go on and on. There's chocolate, there's about 12, 13 categories in there. Except for yogurt, they're all down. And I think that's largely driven by the overall consumer uncertainty about the future and the fact that they feel that they really need to focus on the key things at this moment until they feel better about the future. I think we will see similar moves in less eating out of home, less entertainment, less travel. You can see the consumer not only in food, but across the board really being very, very frugal and very careful.\nAs things improve, hopefully, I think we will see that change. Maybe the other thing I would say is that it is true that there is a bit more of a pronounced health and wellness approach. I would say the categories that are health and wellness within snacking, that could be things like yogurt or protein bars, for instance, or within the normal categories, gluten-free or less sugar, things like that, those are doing better than the rest of the category. So that would be, on top of consumer confidence, the only other trend that I see at the moment that is reflective of the snacking category.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I just want to ask you a follow-up on emerging markets. There was a bit of a slowdown in this quarter to 4%. I'm wondering how you're thinking about emerging markets broadly for the rest of the year. Could we return to high single-digit growth? What markets would you highlight that are maybe getting your attention more than others? Thanks.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. So I would say if you look quickly where we are in our four main emerging markets, so China is up high single digit in Q1. India is down high single digit in Q1 because of a number of reasons. We expect a strong, we had a strong prior year base. We did some pricing in chocolate. We have some elasticity impacts there. And we do have a bit of a muted biscuit consumption where we play in the premium segment of the market, and the consumer is switching. We expect India in the remainder of the year to start to grow faster. We expect China, which I mentioned first, to remain at high single digit for the rest of the year.\nIn both countries, we have a large distribution runway, so we can complement what happens in the same store sales with extra stores, and that makes a difference for us. Brazil was mid-single digit growth in Q1. We will be doing more pricing in chocolate. We are doing a number of new activities in our biscuit business and in our candy and gum business. So I'm expecting that Brazil will remain there, maybe accelerate a little bit. And then Mexico is gradually getting better. You have to keep in mind that we lapped there a bit of a difficulty with the integration of Ricolino last year. We were low single digit in Q1, but we see good movement on Oreo, Ricolino, and Philadelphia in Mexico. So I think there we will also see an acceleration.\nI wouldn't say that our total of emerging markets will get to double digit, but certainly we will see an acceleration in the second half from where we are today.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nOkay. That concludes the call for today. Q1 down. So far, so good. We'll see you for Q2.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's program. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."

Your program is about to begin. If you need assistance during the conference today, please press star zero.\nGood day and welcome to the Mondel?z International Q4 2024 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondel?z's management and the question and answer session. In order to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touchtone phone at any time during the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President Investor Relations for Mondel?z. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nSVP Investor Relations, Mondel?z International\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO, and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements as we discuss our results today. Unless otherwise noted, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide year-over-year growth on a Constant Currency basis unless otherwise noted.\nYou can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation today. Dirk will provide a business strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide 4. I'm pleased to share that 2024 was another strong year for Mondel?z. We delivered balanced top-line growth, strong earnings, and robust free cash flow generation while returning significant capital back to shareholders. Our top line grew mid-single-digit with balanced performance across both developed and emerging markets, and we delivered positive volume mix in the second half of the year with improved share performance despite continuing input cost inflation. We achieved gross profit dollar growth in the mid-single-digits driven by ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing. This allowed us to continue to increase our investments in brands, distribution, and organizational capabilities. We also continued our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $3.5 billion, which includes our settlement with the European Commission.\nWe also continue to prioritize capital return, delivering $4.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. As we transition into 2025, we remain focused on executing with excellence against our long-term growth strategy. We are confident that our chocolate playbook will enable us to successfully navigate unprecedented cocoa cost inflation, and we'll share additional color later in today's call. Perhaps most importantly, I remain convinced the Mondel?z team represents the very best people in the consumer packaged goods business, and I'm proud of our team for staying focused and agile in a challenging operating environment. With the right strategy, the right brands, the right geographic footprint, and the right people, I'm confident that we continue to be solidly positioned for attractive long-term growth.\nTurning to slide five, you can see that 2024 was a strong year on both the top and bottom lines. Despite the impact of cocoa cost phasing. In Q4, Luca will provide some additional perspectives on our cocoa cost strategy in a few minutes. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 4.3% and adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 5.1% for the year. Our volume mix results demonstrate that consumers continue to prioritize our brands and our categories. It is important to underscore that we continued reinvesting in our brands to drive faster growth. Our high single digit investment increase in ANC continues to strengthen consumer and customer loyalty to our brands. Adjusted EPS grew 13% on top of strong growth in the past several years, and we delivered free cash flow of $3.5 billion.\nWe remain confident that our commitment to executing with excellence while reinvesting in our strong brands, capabilities, and talent will enable us to continue delivering attractive long-term value for our stakeholders.\nOn slide six, you can see that our continued confidence is grounded in evidence of consumers' enduring preference for snacking all over the world. Snacks remain an important part of people's lives at home, at work or school, and on the go. We're proud that consumers continue to prioritize our strong brands even in challenging times. In North America, consumer confidence has improved slightly following the US election despite continuing concern about the economic outlook. While biscuit category volume remained relatively flat over the last three months, private label continues to decline demonstrating that consumers remain loyal to their favorite brands and that our price pack architecture initiatives are showing promising signs. As a result, Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz all are regaining share.\nMeanwhile in Europe, consumer confidence and also price elasticities remain stable despite ongoing uncertainty in the economic and political environment. We continue to see solid category value growth in both biscuits and chocolate, and our brands are steadily gaining share following disruption during the first half of the year. Elasticities also remain stable in emerging markets with solid consumer confidence in India, Brazil, and Mexico amid continued softness in China. Overall, we're seeing solid category growth in both volume and value across our combined emerging markets, and Mondel?z share is improving in both biscuits and chocolate. Turning to Slide seven, we are continuing to make progress against our strategic growth agenda, reinvesting in our brands, expanding distribution, strengthening our capabilities, and continuing to transform our portfolio. Here are just a few highlights of our strategy in action.\nOur iconic global brands including Oreo and Cadbury Dairy Milk executed award-winning activations that resonated strongly with consumers, driving incremental lift. For example, Oreo's Space Dunk campaign and our innovative global collaboration with Coca-Cola helped strengthen partnerships with key retailers around the world. Similarly, Cadbury's year-long celebration of its 200th anniversary delivered groundbreaking creative and strong return on investment. Looking ahead, we're excited about the potential of our just announced Oreo partnership with Post Malone which will hit our store shelves later this week. Capturing the current cultural vibe, this limited edition features our first ever Twisted Creme. Along with these creative brand reinvestments, we continue to expand distribution around the world which includes a special focus on accelerating digital channels. Our E-commerce business grew double digits in 2024 and we continue investing in new capabilities to accelerate our leadership in digital snacking.\nIn fact, our next tier markets grew approximately 35% in 2024 as a result of our continued investments. We are also making significant progress on growing our revenue growth management capabilities. We launched new Fresh Stacks during Q4 across our largest US brands including Oreo, Ritz, and Chips Ahoy!. These new offerings provide products our consumers love in smaller Fresh Stacks packs at an attractive everyday price. In chocolate, we are launching an array of pack sizes at several new price points around the world. Additionally, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping strategy. In 2024, we purchased a majority stake in Evirth, the leader in China's fast-growing frozen to chilled baked snacks category. We have worked with Evirth for several years to develop, manufacture, market, and sell cakes and pastries featuring some of our iconic brands including Oreo and Philadelphia.\nOur expanded partnerships enables us to further accelerate growth through continuous innovation, leveraging the combination of our high-value brands with Evirth's advanced R&D and technical expertise.\nWe also liquidated our investment in JDE Peet's, providing another important source of funding for reinvestment that can be used to buy our stock as well as further advancing our brands talent and capabilities on slide eight, along with our financial performance and strategic growth priorities. I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress toward our sustainability objectives in 2024. First, we continue to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourcing critical ingredients. About 90% of the cocoa volume used in our chocolate brands is now sourced through Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program which works to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa is grown. We also made continued progress in helping to combat climate change. We reduced carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by about 38% versus our baseline in 2018.\nAdditionally, we continued advancing our light and right packaging strategy. Approximately 96% of our packaging is recyclable. We also continue investing in ways to empower consumers to make more mindful snacking choices that fit into their healthy, active lifestyles. Approximately 80% of our snacks revenue comes from mindful portion snacks, i.e., snacks that are packaged in individually wrapped mindful portion serving sizes or with clear mindful portion recommendations on the pack. These are just a few preliminary highlights of our continuing progress towards building a more sustainable snacking company. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for our stakeholders. We encourage you to watch our annual Snacking Made Right report which will be published in April to view our full year sustainability data.\nTurning to slide nine, I'd like to reinforce our conviction that Mondel?z remains well positioned to navigate through a very dynamic operating environment. Like many other companies, we are closely tracking and planning around several near term themes including variations in consumer confidence, foreign exchange volatility, potential changes in trade policy, and pricing negotiations, all against the backdrop of record cocoa prices.\nBy focusing on our strengths and controlling our controllables, we're confident that we have the right strategy, the right execution, and the right people to effectively navigate these headwinds. Our teams have undertaken extensive planning since last spring for the challenges created by record cocoa input costs. We have a clear and sound strategy to navigate these conditions, which Luca will describe in more detail in a few minutes. At the same time, our categories remain resilient, and consumers continue to prioritize our iconic snacking brands. We remain committed to reinvesting in our brands and capabilities to continue accelerating this momentum. We also continue to focus on expanding distribution opportunities in both developed and emerging markets, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation gives us confidence that we will continue to generate strong free cash flow.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to reiterate that 2024 was another strong year and that we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth. While the road ahead will not be without challenges, our team is at its best when we are united and clear about what we need to do. By continuing to double down our attractive core categories of chocolate, biscuits, and baked snacks, investing in our widely loved brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline, and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insight on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. In 2024 we delivered strong results from top to bottom. We posted balanced growth across developed and emerging markets. We grew gross profit dollars by mid-single digits, adjusted EPS growth was double digits, and free cash flow was once again quite good. This was a continuation of our virtuous cycle which enables us to maintain strong growth, important reinvestments, and strong return of capital back to shareholders. Revenue growth was 4.3% in the year with volume mix down 1 point. For the quarter, growth was more than 5% with a slight increase in volume mix. Emerging markets grew by 6.2% for the year and 6.7% for the quarter, with trends coming from a substantial number of key countries including China, Brazil, South Africa, the Western Andean, and Central and Eastern Europe.\nDeveloped markets grew 3.2% for the year and 4.3% for the quarter, including strong growth from Europe and solid results from the US.\nMoving to portfolio performance on Slide 12, our chocolate and biscuit businesses both delivered good growth for the year. Also, gum and candy continued to perform well. Biscuit grew 1.7% for the year and 2.1% for the quarter. Several brands delivered attractive growth for 2024 including Oreo, Ritz, belVita, Tate, 7Days, Club Social, and Perfect Snacks. Chocolate grew 7.4% for the year and 8.9% for the quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix declined 2% for the year and 2.3% in the quarter. Our two flagship global brands, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka, delivered outstanding growth while we also delivered strong growth with our local jewels portfolio including Lacta, Côte d'Or, Freia, and Marabou. Gum and Candy grew more than 7% for the year and nearly 9% for the quarter. Key markets including China, Brazil, and Western Andean all performed well.\nLet's review market share performance on slide 13. We held or gained share in 50% of our revenue base with strong results in both chocolate and biscuits. Although there is more work to do, we made strong progress in the back half of the year including the last three months as approximately 17% of revenue held or gained share due to improvements in North America biscuits. Strong brand reinvestment, revenue growth management initiatives, and solid execution have driven recent improvements.\nMoving to regional performance on Slide 14.\nEurope grew 5.7% for the year and 7.4% for the quarter. Strong execution, including pricing, led to attractive growth despite significant customer disruption in AF1.\nOI dollars in 2024 were up 8.8% for the year and down more than 40% in Q4. The sharp decline in European Q4 profit was driven by the dramatic ramp in our cocoa cost pipeline without the benefit of additional pricing and cost measures that are expected in 2025.\nNorth America grew 1.5% for the full year while Q4 grew 0.4%. Full year growth was driven by solid performance across a number of brands and growth channels. In Q4, volume mix grew 1.3%, driven by growth in our new Fresh Stacks price packs as well as trends from Dave and Perfect Snacks. Overall, we saw a good start with the rollout of the new price packs in Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. We entered 2025 encouraged by our new price packs, expectations for category growth, and initiatives around growth channel trade programs and new distribution growth.\nNorth America OI increased 0.4% for the year. For the quarter, OI decreased 11.5%. This decline was a result of higher trade spend, some cost pressure, particularly as we ramp up production of the newly launched price point SKU, and a settlement of a legal case.\nEMEA grew 6.2% for the year and 8.6% for the quarter with solid volume mix growth to finish the year. China grew high single digits for the year and quarter. Australia posted strong growth for both the year and quarter, as well as Southeast Asia returned to growth in Q4. India delivered low single digit growth for the year and quarter as strength in chocolate was offset by soft biscuits. As a result, we are encouraged by work being done in India and in the biscuits business specifically around smaller packs and lower price points as we head into 2025.\nEMEA increased OI dollars by 13.4% for the year, while OI declined 28% in Q4, resulting from unfavorable cocoa phasing. Latin America grew 4.6% for the year and 4.9% for the quarter behind solid performance from Brazil and the Western Andean group of countries. Latin America delivered another strong year of profitability. OI grew 10.7% for the year while declining 5.7% for Q4. Profitability was lower in the quarter driven by cocoa. Turning to page 15, for the year we delivered strong high single-digit to high double-digit growth. This growth enables significant level of reinvestments in our brands and capabilities for 2025 and beyond. In Q4 we saw a notable decline in OI dollars growth. This decline was primarily a result of unfavorable cocoa pipeline that we noted in our Q3 call.\nThese cost headwinds came without additional offsets in pricing or overheads reduction, which we expect to initiate in 2025.\nNext to EPS on slide 16, full-year EPS grew 13% in constant currency. The significant majority of this growth was driven by operating gains, and despite currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS at reported forex and by more than 9%. Q4 EPS growth declined due to previously mentioned spike in the cocoa cost pipeline.\nTurning to Slide 17, we delivered $3.5 billion of free cash flow for the full year, including the settlement of the European Commission matter of nearly $400 million. We returned $4.7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, with nearly half of our share repurchase coming in Q4.\nConsistent with our capital allocation priorities, we announced a new $9 billion share repurchase authorization in December, which runs from 2025 through 2027. We continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock at depressed levels given our view of the intrinsic value.\nBefore we get into the details of our outlook, let me provide additional thoughts on cocoa. The market continues to show signs of volatility and has reverted to elevated levels during much of the past three months despite a good Main Crop. Several factors have contributed to this situation, including concerns about the Mid Crop in Côte d'Ivoire, ongoing low liquidity, and low industry coverage. This backdrop has created more pressure on our P&L for 25 as it relates to the portion that was still unhedged or protected through flexible structures at the time we spoke to you back in the Q3 call.\nAlthough we cannot predict specific timing, we continue to believe that the inverted nature of the market combined with lower demand levels due to higher pricing and elasticity will eventually bring cocoa to a more sustainable price level.\nAs Dirk mentioned, we have been planning our 2025 business for some time now in advance of elevated levels of cocoa, and we have developed a clear and comprehensive chocolate strategy. This includes leveraging a robust RGM playbook, strong marketing and sales execution, and remaining agile with the right incentives and targeted cost savings.\nA few words on 2025 and key planning assumptions on Slide 20. For the current year, we expect to deliver on our long-term algorithm for revenue. We currently expect top line to be approximately 5%. We have planned for higher levels of elasticity in chocolate, but we need to remain agile and assess the situation as new prices get implemented. We expect an adjusted EPS decline this year given the unprecedented levels of cocoa cost in our chocolate P&L. This decline is expected to be approximately 10% versus the base of $3.36 in 2024. That excludes JDE Peet's from the equity income. This outlook does not include the impact of the potentially significant new executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on US imports from Mexico and Canada.\nThis would create an additional headwind to the business, but given the fluid and rapidly changing nature of timing, it is difficult to provide a reliable estimate of impact for the full year at this time. Overall, we believe this outlook is a prudent planning stance based on our visibility to cocoa costs in 2025, which is substantially protected and hedged at this point. This assumption is based on the principles I just discussed. Based on our view of earnings, we are planning for Free Cash Flow of $3 billion plus. In terms of other key assumptions for inflation, we expect a double-digit increase for 2025 versus 2024 driven almost entirely by cocoa as well as some labor costs.\nIn terms of interest expense, we expect approximately $350 million.\nWe expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the mid-20s. Note that our cash tax rate is expected to run approximately two points lower than this rate, and for share repurchase, we are expecting at least $3 billion with the flexibility to go higher depending on stock price. We are expecting approximately $0.12 of EPS headwind related to Forex for the year, before opening up for Q&A. A few comments on 2026. In 2025, we are trying to strike the right balance by running a reasonable P&L while taking a responsible and thoughtful approach to maintaining the health of the chocolate category. In that context, we continue to scrutinize every dollar we spend, including A&M, where we'll continue to prioritize brand investments and properly support brands as long as we believe the return is sufficient.\nWe do expect EPS growth in 2026 based on cocoa levels staying elevated but stable. Cocoa futures might come down, but we are not there yet. So we will continue to plan various scenarios with the base case for a continuation of elevated levels. If cocoa stays high, we would expect to gradually price more. If cocoa starts to come down, then we would expect earnings delivery to be higher. Regardless, we expect EPS growth in 2026. With that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star two. Once again, that is Star one to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Appreciate it, Dirk. Maybe to start, given where cocoa has gone the past few months, maybe you can talk about how that, if at all, changes your approach and chocolate strategy, and with that, the state of the European business given that's your largest chocolate market and seems like even more price will likely be necessary even into 2026.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, yes. Well hello Andrew and thanks for the question. Well, as it relates to cocoa and chocolate, the first thing I would say that in our eyes chocolate remains a great snacking category, which so far has been remarkably durable.\nIt's been quite robust in 2024 already with some significant pricing but still healthy volumes. That's driven by the fact that there is iconic brands that we have and others have that are taste of the nation high brand loyalty. There's very little private label consumers quote chocolate. That's one of their indulgences that they cannot live without. So we continue to feel that this is a great snacking category. Our view is that despite the short term volatility that our approach needs to be to protect the category health, to protect our share in the category, and to protect our brand investment.\nWe are seeing some structural change to the cocoa pricing in the cocoa market, but we don't think that will continue to the current magnitude for sure. Cocoa prices will remain higher than they've been in the past, but they will come down eventually from the current high to our opinion. The other thing I would say is that from our view we need to protect key price points and thresholds so that consumers can continue to enjoy their chocolate. So that means in emerging markets we continue to hold the.\nPrice points of our low unit pricing, and in the developed markets we try to make sure that we have the right entry level. We accompany that in 2025 with very strong revenue growth management plans and PPA plans to make sure that the consumers can have consumption at all different price points. We are going to continue to invest. In the category, we are optimizing that investment, but we will continue to support our brand strongly.\nOf course we will do some additional cost measures to protect the bottom line. So as I said, we're trying to optimize our ANC investment. We're looking at zero overhead or negative overhead growth, and we have the highest supply chain productivity program in the history of the company for 2025. And we will continue to hedge our chocolate.\nWe don't see a reason to change our strategy there. So for 2025 we have a very strong agenda. We have an enormous revenue growth management program. We have changed the price pack architecture on more than $5 billion of our net revenue. We have to do significant line pricing which we are implementing as we speak. If cocoa prices remain elevated where they are today, that might require more pricing in the second half of this year and in 2026. But as I said, we think eventually cocoa prices will start to come down. There already has been some significant pricing around the world in chocolate, and I'm happy to report that the elasticities have held up well. So we're looking at a 0.4 elasticity. And so far what we've seen, even in the places where we've had 10, 15% price increase, that that holds.\nWe are also of course looking at optimizing our promotions. We're doing active portfolio management.\nElasticities. We have estimated around 0.4. I was mentioning we will need to remain agile and adapt to the circumstances. But overall we do believe that we have the right strategy. We have very strong activations and innovations also planned. We are launching new flavors, new experiences. We have the biggest seasonal agenda in chocolate. We are starting and launching products in our Biscoff partnership. So that also we think will drive consumer interest. We are monitoring consumers very closely, and that gives us reason for optimism. So far we don't see any major shifts.\nIf then look at the P&L of chocolate for 25. Our main objective is to protect the category, protect our share, and we think we can do that with a reasonable P&L. And I'm sure that Luca will talk a little bit more about that, which includes significant investment and robust activations, and we are not taking any shortcuts for short term gains. So that's a little bit the way we look at chocolate. If I translate that to Europe at this stage, consumer confidence in Europe is pretty stable. It's subdued, but it's stable.\nThe purchasing power is soft. There is ongoing economic and political uncertainty, of course, but overall we feel that the consumer is in a good place, probably in a better place than the consumer is in the US. The category consumption in chocolate is pretty good. We have very solid value growth. We have good volume growth. We're seeing a little bit of deceleration in the last three months, but that's because pricing is starting to come, and as I said, the elasticities are as expected. For instance, in the UK we're looking at a 0.37 elasticity so far, and we've already increased prices by about 15%.\nSo. I think after we had client disruption in the beginning of the year, we saw very good business continuation in Europe. We had broad-based growth across the region. Chocolate was growing 8% in value over the last three months for us, with the highest Christmas net revenue in chocolate, double-digit growth.\nWe're seeing very nice growth across channels from discounters to world travel retail. And we had a great share performance. So everything so far in Europe is good. And as you can see from the numbers, the quarter and the year looks pretty good, except of course for the cocoa effect, but that over time will start to.\nGo down as our pricing takes hold. So for 2025 we have this big RGM agenda, we have the activations of promotions. We do assume in our estimate at the moment, client disruption, the chocolate P&L will gradually improve as pricing takes hold. And we still have some significant pricing and PPA to do, but we do believe that we have the right estimates in our forecast. So pretty optimistic about the chocolate category, and we do feel that our European business is well prepared to deal with this.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThat's awesome. Thanks so much for that very fulsome answer. And then Luca, just quickly can you walk us through some of the puts and takes for the 2025 outlook in terms of phasing around EPS and margins? And although early, just how do we think about the key considerations for 2026 that you got into briefly in the prepared remarks? Thanks so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah, thank you, Andrew. As far as the 2025 guidance goes, I think we have to start by saying that we feel good about how we ended the year in terms of revenue and growth momentum. As we just said, we feel quite good with the benign elasticity in chocolate. Total growth of the categories where we compete was good, and importantly, I think we were happy to see share momentum picking up. So this is good news given that 70% of the business is non chocolate, and we expect a normal year in terms of biscuits, bakeries, and other categories. Chocolate profitability is clearly the main concern of the plan. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the chocolate spikes in the last few months have given us a little bit of a headwind compared to what we told you and we anticipated back in October.\nWe have beefed up the plan in terms of pricing actions and RGM. As we just said, we need to continue to strike a good balance, especially in emerging markets between price and volume.\nTo offset some of the profit pressure. We have unprecedented cost measures, I would say particularly in the productivity area of our manufacturing network, but we also have reduced overheads and the non-working media spending. So our goal is to deliver a plan that is executing well in all non-chocolate category. And for chocolate, I think the key will be to minimize the volume implications together with ensuring that we exit 2025 with a reasonable profit per kilo as a key measure for us to monitor. The profit margin throughout 2025 will be more pressured in Q1 given the fact that we are in the midst of negotiations with customers and we haven't implemented the pricing yet, but we feel quite good at this point given the progress we have made.\nI think you will start seeing profit improvement in terms of sequential improvement versus Q1 and Q4 as we progress throughout the year. Again, the clear goal for us is to end 2025 in a place where we are well positioned to deliver EPS growth in 2026. Clearly it is quite premature to talk about 2020, but we wanted you to hear very clearly that our goal is to grow EPS for 2026. At this point in time we see a bifurcation of scenarios into 2026. I believe the most likely scenario is that cocoa prices will come down, in which case we will have higher earnings upside potential.\nBut if cocoa stays elevated, we will have to take a little bit more pricing, and our approach over the last few years and in 2024 as well is to take multiple pricing actions and to allow consumers to get accustomed to higher levels of pricing. So we believe that in either case, whether cocoa comes down or stays high, we have a path to delivering EPS growth into 2026.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nNext to Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you, Dirk. In North America, both price and volume mix came in below the street in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, can you maybe expand on how you view the general health of the biscuit category here in the US and also your expectations roughly for both volume and price in 2025 in North America in light of how you think about that category and your share within?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, yes I can. Well, the consumer in the US is still quite concerned. The economy, the political situation, and of course inflation. And as we've talked in the past, the value definition has clearly changed in most categories I would say, but also in the biscuit category.\nBasically, higher income consumers are trying to buy bigger packs while lower income consumers are focused on lower unit prices. Also, the channel shopping behavior significantly changed. I would say at this stage the US biscuit category is softer. The elasticities are increasing to a certain degree. The category growth in the last three months was 0.6%. We did improve our shares during that period, but overall I would call that soft. The good news is that the penetration and the volume per trip is holding up.\nThere's a number of reasons for that. First of all, prices have stopped rising.\nIn fact, prices have probably come down, and that's part of what you see in Q4 because we launched a number of packs at lower price points, and the promo intensity is also increasing. I would say within the category, cookies are performing in line with broader snacking, while crackers are softer. Q4, while maybe below the market estimates, was, in our opinion, a solid quarter.\nWe had a net revenue growth of 0.4%. Volume mix was 1.3%. OI was lower. The reasons for that was first of all we were lapping a lower trade spend last year, and we were also lapping some SG&A one-timers. But the good news for us was that we grew biscuit share with more than 30 basis points in Q4. We did a number of innovations as I mentioned, Fresh Stacks, and launched for instance the Chips Ahoy! chewy cookie, and we had very good channel results. Also the one that was a bit of a decliner was Give & Go that had to do with the fact that our kids business declined to pre-COVID levels. If I look at 2025 for the category, I would say, sorry, the pricing possibilities are limited. We'll have a little bit; we will continue to do PPA for lower price points.\nWe will have some very strong activations. You see the first one with Post Malone on Oreo as is currently going on. I do think that we will have a good volume growth next year because of those lower price points and the fact that we have underdeveloped channels. Plus we can drive more penetration of some of our brands. So I think we will combine a good volume growth with lower pricing. So maybe our percentage gross profit will come down. But we do think that the dollars that we will generate will be quite strong. So I'm expecting a solid P&L in North America in 2025.\nThat's helpful.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nAnd then quickly, Luca, just on cocoa, I think you and Dirk have been using the word eventually more than usual today. It may be fair, maybe not. But it seems like you're incrementally less confident today that cocoa is bound to fall in the near term. So I'm curious: has anything structurally changed in your view of supply and demand, or is this just a situation where you have to at least partially just accept the current reality whether it's justified or not?\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nLook, I think it is.\nTough for us, quite frankly, to make sense of the current elevated prices. Yes, it is true the main crop, which I remind you accounts for 30% of the total yearly production of cocoa, is subdued and there was a little bit of a drier weather than was anticipated. But reality is as of today the port arrivals are up almost 25%, and I believe even in the worst case scenario of the main crop being subpar, we foresee most likely a supply increase compared to last year that is around about 10%. The latest grinding numbers have been quite quiet. And so demand doesn't reflect yet major changes, but we start seeing signs, particularly in parts of the world like North America, where cocoa consumption is coming down.\nAnd so that should provide, I believe, on a longer-term perspective, a little bit of a relief in terms of also demand. I think the market is very thin. If you look at the industry is covered by shortly. If you look at volume that gets traded daily, it is very, very small. And obviously in this environment.\nWe see particularly speculators to drive cost prices that are elevated. So look, I think I was really hoping that by now with the Main Crop behind us and the good numbers, cocoa will be more benign.\nBut it isn't. And so we have assumed a cocoa price that stays elevated for 2025 and in our plans it is elevated for 2026 as well, in the sense that we prefer planning that way, rather than assuming and having an assumption that drives EPS growth simply because of cocoa coming down. We are committing to you that EPS in 2026 will grow either way and, and we want to be ready for the worst. But quite frankly, given that I believe there would be a surplus between supply and demand in 2025, I believe eventually cocoa will have to come down.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks.\nJust a theoretical follow up on that. You mentioned that you believe that cocoa prices would return to a more sustainable price level. I'm wondering whatever that level is, it might not be the 3,000 where we were not that long ago, and it might not be the 10,000 we're at now, but let's say 5,000, 6,000, whatever it is, and we get to that place in the next one or two years. Is it your belief that you will have the ability and that you will ultimately get to a point where you're pricing away the dollar input inflation and that essentially over a multi-year period your algorithm will normalize? Is that still your belief?\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, I think what you have to assume is that just picking the numbers that you have quoted, 3,000, and I don't know if you were talking about dollars or GBP, but call it GBP, we will be priced at the level that is higher than that. And so I think the question becomes, at that level of cocoa, how quickly are we going to adjust? If any adjustment itself is made, price is down. And I think as much as there is friction going up and as much as we are never priced throughout, I would say the next couple of quarters at the right level of cocoa, it is fine to assume that as cocoa starts coming down, our price too will be better than the 3,000 you quoted.\nAnd so in that context, our profitability will be quite good and would allow us to have a P&L that makes more than sense. And so I think if cocoa comes down, earnings power is there. If cocoa stays high, which again we don't control, we will have to price a little bit more in 2026. And as I said in a previous question, this approach of multiple pricing waves is the best in terms of getting consumers accustomed to new price levels, and minimizing elasticity and volume losses.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you for that. Just as you're reviewing cocoa prices.\nI would imagine that the visibility on the past crop is behind us. I'm wondering what are you going to be watching and when will you make up your mind about the need for additional pricing. Like what time frames are you under, are we under review here? Is this something that you're going to make a decision to pivot by the time we get to the second half of this year? How will that work?\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nSo I think for 2025 we are pretty much done in terms of coverage, and now what we have assumed at this point is that we will have to take multiple price waves. And you know, there are situations where we have two, other situations where we're going to take three price increases. As Dirk said, we have an unprecedented amount of RGM which has come to fruition throughout the year. And so we are planning to for the current levels of cocoa, a series of actions that we will take throughout 2025.\nNow, if we realize that the Main Crop numbers, which we're going to start getting a sense towards September, October, if we realize that demand for cocoa in general is coming down and the numbers will be coming out throughout the year, but the first half will give us an indication of how much global demand is subdued.\nWe will try to understand the price implication on cocoa. We will decide as we go what is best to do for the second part of the year in light of a plausible cocoa level for 2026. And so quite frankly we have to remain quite open to understanding what cocoa is going to do in 2026 and as a consequence we will act accordingly, particularly in the second part of the year. The first pricing waves according to the level of cocoa that we have today had been taken between October and December in few cases. We are under European negotiations literally as we speak. There might be other pricing waves that we'll take in the second part of the year depending on our view on 2026 cocoa levels.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Tom Palmer with Citi.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little more on the expected cadence of both earnings. And COGS inflation.\nAnd specifically on COGS inflation, it looks like Q4 2024 we saw a bigger step up. Will be then thinking through Q1 to Q3, see a more normal rate, and then inflation starts to ease based on current futures. And then, just given the outsized earnings pressure in Q1, might you then the main offset be Q4? I just want to make sure we're thinking through those moving pieces being between cost and pricing over the course of the year.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. So.\nThe pressure that you saw on profitability in Q4, it is the fact that cocoa was fairly high into our P&L in Q4. Your assumption should be that that level of cocoa keeps until, you know, for the full 2025. At this level, at this point in time, that's our assumption. So I think you should assume that that level of cocoa is equally spread throughout the remaining quarters of 2025. Now, the differential in terms of gating for profitability of 2025 is that we will have more pricing coming into the P&L. So the elevated inflation is going to keep on hitting Q1, Q2, Q3. Obviously Q4 will be different because there is already elevated level of cocoa in the baseline. The difference is you're going to see sequential price improvement throughout the year, particularly as of Q2, Q3, and Q4.\nAnd. That will provide benefits to the profitability of the company.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks for that. On the elasticity you mentioned so far, that elasticity was 0.4. Just any color on what's embedded in guidance at this point?\nThanks.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThat is the guidance number. We have seen elasticities that are a little bit lower than that. We monitor elasticities very closely. I can tell you that in Q3 and Q4, the elasticity for chocolate that we saw was a little bit lower. The current planning assumption for 2025 is that elasticity on average is 0.4, 0.5 times. And that number is higher than what we have seen in 2024.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Max Gumport with BNP Paribas.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nDirector of Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThanks for the question. You mentioned a number of times in this call that you have one of the highest supply chain productivity programs in your history coming up in 2025. I was hoping you could just put. A bit of a finer point on just how big that program might be. Thanks very much.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. The typical targets that we have is about a 4%. Gross productivity on our supply chain. And then depending on inflation rates and some other investments we might do, we try to translate that into a net. Productivity. In the past three, four years, it has been very difficult to reach that 4%. But we are planning to reach that in 2025. So that gives you an idea.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nDirector of Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks very much. And then turning back to North America and what you're seeing within your biscuit and cracker categories, and I understand your share performance is improving. Consumers still feeling some financial pressure in the US. I didn't hear you speak much to whether or not you think there is a shift away from snacking that's going on due to a consumer that's more focused on health and wellness, or a consumer that's more and more likely to be on a GLP-1 drug. So just curious on your view on the broader snacking category in the US and whether or not there is some headwinds you need to consider because of this shift to to health and wellness.\nThanks very much.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, thank you. I would say in our view at the moment, no, we do not necessarily see snacking diminishing because there is a shift to health and wellness or there is a decreased consumption in snacking because of GLP-1. We've monitored that very carefully, and so far there is. There's really no effect that we can tell within snacking. There might be a shift to more healthier products, but that has been going on for years, and I wouldn't say that in recent years there had been a shift there. In fact, since COVID the indulgent part in snacking is growing just as fast as the healthy part. So that was different before COVID. So if anything the indulgent part remains as it was before.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nDirector of Equity Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now move to our final question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nDirector and Head of US Consumer Staples Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon, Dirk and Luca. Thanks for the question. I'll keep it relatively short or to one question, but maybe with two parts. So Luca, if I could just hone in on the earnings per share. The actual guidance, roughly $2.90 for 2025, and with the clean numbers without JDE, you were $3.08 in 2023 and $3.36 in 2024. The question A is 2023 probably the right high watermark to use from an earnings per share perspective? Just given this past year you had some cost favorability at least through the first nine months relative to.\nPrice relative to cocoa. So as we're thinking about growing off that $2.90 base over whatever time frame, FY 2023 is maybe a better high watermark. Then the second part of that is just what is the path back to that? Can you get to that high water mark with cocoa where it is currently? Does that need to come down, obviously, to hit the number, and not looking to put a time frame around it, but just if you can unpack what the path back to that.\nIt would be helpful. Thanks very much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nSo just to be clear, it is not that cocoa in 2024 is lower than 2023. It is that cocoa was higher and we priced some water replacement costs in the first part of the year, and we have been taking advantage of the favorable pipeline compared to market, not compared to 2023. So arguably the base EPS might be what you saw in the first three quarters of the year, provided that cocoa comes down to the levels of the first three quarters and that we hold on to the pricing that we have implemented.\nSo if you are trying to understand by when we can be back on track with a reasonable level of EPS, I think the question really becomes at what level of pricing are we going to be priced, particularly in 2026, and what level of cocoa are we going to have into the base P&L of 2026? What I wanted to say, particularly in the previous answers and in the prepared remarks, is that either way, we are committing to an EPS growth in 2026. If cocoa comes down in 2027 or in 2026, the earnings upside potential that we have will put us back to levels that most likely you saw in the first few quarters of 2024. Again, I don't know if cocoa will come down at all. And that's where our commitment to you is that EPS will grow in 2026.\nThat's where we are telling you that regardless of the level of cocoa, there are two options here. Either we price more and we will get there, or if cocoa retrenches and comes down, the earnings power is within our P&L.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nDirector and Head of US Consumer Staples Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the conference back to Mr. Dirk Van de Put for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, well, thank you very much. Thank you for attending this call. Looking forward to update you at the end of Q1 when I assume that we will have a much clearer look already at how cocoa is evolving and how the pricing is landing in the markets. And until then, obviously we are always available to answer any of your questions. Thank you.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.\nToday, Dirk will provide a business strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we delivered a solid first half to the year with strong profit dollar growth driven by effective cost management and pricing. We also successfully completed our annual pricing in Europe, which helps position us well for the second half in terms of top line and volume growth. We continue to see momentum in emerging markets and we are continuing to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities to drive sustainable, long-term growth. And we continued our track record of strong free cash flow generating $1.5 billion.\nWhile our operating environment remains challenging and dynamic, our teams remain focused and agile in executing against our long-term growth strategy. We continue to play for the long term in chocolate, biscuits and backed snacks because these core categories remain strong consumer favorites with very high loyalty to our iconic brand portfolio. Within these great categories, our advantaged geographic footprint provides additional confidence that we are well positioned to compound long-term sustainable growth.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that organic net revenue grew 2.5% this quarter with adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 11.3%, enabling us to continue investing in the business. A&C spending is up high single digits, helping to drive consumer and customer loyalty to both our iconic global brands and our local jewels. Adjusted EPS grew 25%. Turning to Slide 6. While many food and beverage segments are continuing to experience softness, snacking remains relatively durable.\nConsumer trends vary by region, but overall, we are seeing volume growth start to rebound as inflation cools. Consumer incomes are rising, which helps to reduce the inflation-driven financial strain on many households. As a result, private label growth in our categories is decelerating while branded share growth is improving. In North America, some consumers are seeking snacking options at specific price points to fit within a specific overall ticket size. Other consumers who are more focused on convenience, look for multipacks, which offer value as well as variety and versatility.\nOur proven playbook for price pack architecture allows us to offer a broad range of options to meet each of these consumers deferring definitions of value. As a result, our 2 largest U.S. brands, OREO and Ritz are gaining share year-to-date. Meanwhile, in Europe, elasticities are moving slightly higher but remain modest. Consumer confidence is cautiously optimistic and is rising in the second quarter versus the same period last year as inflation softened and incomes rise behind stable employment. We continue to see positive value growth in biscuits and chocolate. Volume in seasonal chocolate also is growing well, up 0.6% year-to-date driven by the performance of seasonal [ shapes ], novelties and bite-size products.\nConsumers continue to demonstrate that holidays like Easter just wouldn't be the same without chocolate, and they are willing to spend accordingly. In emerging markets, modest elasticities continue. Our China business is delivering strong growth in online and social commerce. In Brazil, we're seeing an uptick in elasticities but the consumer and economy remain resilient. In Mexico, the economic backdrop is healthy with solid employment and consumer confidence. Within India, we see some food inflation impacting lower and middle-income households driving a pullback in spend and causing some down trading, particularly in biscuits.\nOverall, our combined emerging markets value and volume share is improving in biscuits and chocolate. Against this backdrop of gradually improving consumer confidence, as you can see on Slide 7, we are continuing to deliver against our focused action plan to improve volumes in North America in the second half of the year. We are already seeing value share improvement in OREO and Ritz. To further accelerate growth, we are continuing to increase distribution points across food, club and convenience stores. And to meet the right price points, we are also implementing new, targeted promotions as well as a new pack size priced in the $3 to $4 range, to drive continued brand loyalty and value for Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Ritz.\nAdditionally, we are continuing to launch compelling activations like Star Wars Oreo and Oreo space dunk to delight our fans while driving incremental lift. Turning to Slide 8. Along with improving biscuit volumes in the second half, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth in chocolate. Recent spikes in the cost of cocoa ingredients have been widely discussed, but we soon expect the market correction to a more sustainable price as the mid-crop is emerging in line with historical trends and early signs on the main crop are encouraging.\nChocolate remains a great category. It is continuing to grow with volume resiliency and despite increasing prices. And within this great category, we offer some of the world's strongest, most iconic chocolate brands which include Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone, Côte d'Or, Marabou, Freia and Lacta. These brands are already the leaders in numerous key markets. and we are continuing to invest in A&C to further accelerate loyalty and growth. At the same time, our proven RGM playbook provides our teams with the necessary agility in offsetting inflation while maintaining solid volume dynamics and protecting shares.\nWe remain confident that we are well equipped to continue navigating fluctuating input costs and that we're structurally advantaged to accelerate long-term chocolate growth. Turning to Slide 9. It is important to reinforce that while the external environment remains volatile, we remain focused on accelerating our long-term growth strategy. We're continuing to reinvest in our brands, expand distribution, drive M&A and scale sustainable snacking. We remain on track to deliver 90% of revenue through our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks by 2030. And our teams continue to deliver strong progress against our strategic agenda.\nFor example, our OREO marketing team continues to design and deliver exciting creative activations that capitalize on consumer trends and drive incremental lift. We recently collaborated with Lucas film to launch 2 versions of a special edition Star Wars cookie in the United States, which unites our strong OREO fan base with the equally strong Star Wars fan community. While both versions are wrapped in identical exterior packaging, consumers don't know which sites they're on until they open the pack. This creative and fun approach is driving strong sales, making this collaboration our strongest limited edition yet.\nThis collaboration is the latest example of our strategy to cement the cultural relevance of OREO with key partners who help us bring their favorite stories to life. We're planning some more exciting but still top secret collaborations for the remainder of this year and into 2025. Along with these marketing activations, we are continuing to strengthen store availability, visibility and execution around the world. Here in the U.S., for instance, our performance in the club channel is growing mid-single digits, while the value channel is growing double digits.\nBoth are driven by our family size multi-packs which offer a great price per cookie or cracker rather than overall package prices. We also are continuing to harness the power of recent acquisitions to capture synergies and drive growth. For example, our Chipita baked snacks business is growing high single-digit volume in Europe, led by convenient 7 Day Croissant that helps satisfy consumers on the go across a broad range of snacking occasions. Additionally, we are making continued progress on our environmental and social sustainability agenda.\nFor example, we continue implementing our structured and scientifically validated road map to reach net zero carbon by 2050. As an example, our biscuit manufacturing plant in East Suzhou, China was recently certified as carbon neutral. The plant has reduced carbon emissions by 16,000 tons, the equivalent of planting 7,000 trees for 100 years. Through implementing new technology solutions, including an innovative system to recycle, residual heat and wastewater as well as a new seller photo voltage system to generate green electricity.\nTo learn more about our strategy and review our annual performance data in detail, I encourage you to read our snacking main rights report available on our website. On Slide 10, before I turn the microphone over to Luca, I'd like to briefly highlight our recently announced strategic partnership with Lotus bakeries. This exciting initiative includes 2 main components. First, we will work with Lotus bakeries to develop and launch co-branded chocolate products, combining unique caramelized crispy Biscoff taste with our iconic global chocolate brands, including Cadbury and Milka. We aim to launch the first products in Europe in early 2025.\nSecond, we will manufacture, market, distribute and sell the Lotus Biscoff cookie brand in India starting in the second half of 2025. Partnering with LOTUS will enable us to simultaneously scale our sweet biscuit business in the important emerging market of India, while also innovating our strong European chocolate business with new products to grow consumer interest and loyalty. As we strive to lead the future of snacking by winning in chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks M&A and ventures remain an important part of our growth strategy. This innovative partnership is a great example of our approach, and we continue to explore additional opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q2 marked a solid quarter for the business. with organic net revenue growth across each region, strong profit dollar growth, substantial reinvestment into working media and robust free cash flow generation and capital return. Revenue grew plus 2.5%, with strong pricing execution. This number includes 1.3 points of EU customer disruption that is now behind us. and 40 basis points of [ boycott ] headwinds in our EMEA region. Developed market volume mix was down minus 2.2% for the quarter, primarily impacted by Europe customer disruption, with some ongoing softness in the U.S. biscuit business.\nTotal revenue for emerging markets grew plus 4.5%. Developed markets grew plus 1.2%. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 13. Biscuits and baked snacks grew plus 0.8% for the quarter. Several brands delivered solid growth, including OREO, RITZ, 7Days, Club Social and [ Tate ]. We saw ongoing softness in parts of the U.S. biscuit portfolio. though we have seen early signs of improvement in brands like Chips Ahoy! over recent weeks with clear plans to improve the overall biscuit growth enough to, as we've mentioned. Chocolate grew plus 5.6%, with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets.\nVolume/mix was down minus 2.6%, which was nearly all driven by customer disruption in Europe. Cadbury Dairy Milk; Lacta in Brazil and Freia and Marabou in the Nordics, all posted strong growth during the quarter. Milka also posted solid growth. Gum & Candy grew plus 2.9%, driven by continued momentum and strength in key markets, including China, Brazil and Western Andean. Volume mix in this category was negatively impacted [ by polls ] in the U.S. Let's review market share performance on Slide 14. We held or gain share in 40% of our revenue base with strength in chocolate as well as Gum & Candy. [indiscernible] was partially offset by softer results in our U.S. biscuits business which accounts for approximately 25 percentage points of revenue and disruption in key markets across Europe.\nMoving to regional performance on Slide 15. Europe grew plus 2.7% in Q2. Execution was strong in the quarter with a number of key countries delivering growth through solid pricing and in-store execution, which led to share gains. This trend was partially offset by volume declines associated with expected customer disruption. Pricing is now completely in line with across all key customers, which positions us well for Q3 and up 2 of the year. OI dollars were up nearly 25%, including significant ASC investment. North America grew plus 0.3% against a strong compare of more than 12% in the prior year. Growth channels, including club online and value, along with Canada, delivered solid growth.\nHowever, overall volume mix declined as some consumers continue to seek out products with lower absolute price points, impacting brands like Chips Ahoy!. We have a clear plan to address this dynamic by adding more core packs in the OREO, Chips Ahoy! and Ritz within the $3 to $4 range beginning Q4 while other households continue to prefer the attractive unit price offerings that our family and party packs provide. And although early, a recent reformulation and new promotions have led to gradual improvement in Chips Ahoy!. There is clearly more work to do, but these initial signs are encouraging. North America increased by plus 3.4%, EMEA grew plus 4.2% for the quarter. China delivered another strong quarter with high single-digit growth fueled by ongoing brand equity enhancement in OREO, Chips Ahoy! Stride along with distribution gains.\nIndia was flat overall with strong chocolate growth offset by more competitive intensity and down trading in biscuits as a result of higher overall food inflation. Our India team has plans to activate new pack sizes and new value pricing within Oreo to improve growth and share, starting next month. Australia, New Zealand and Japan delivered a robust quarter of growth, coupled with strong share gains. By cost in the Middle East and Southeast Asia remain a headwind to results, which we expect will continue enough to, though this impact will be in the base beginning in Q4. The overall impact for the region was 2 percentage points worth of growth. EMEA increased OI dollars by more than 46%, with meaningful A&C increases.\nGross base growth, coupled with some upsides related to lapping Nigeria currency losses last year drove this performance. Latin America grew plus 4.5%, with solid price execution and a decline in volume mix. Note that Argentina pricing has been capped at 26% unlike Q2 last year where The country contributed more than 50 points to Latin America growth, brazil and our Western Andean region both delivered mid-single-digit growth. Mexico growth was modest. -- in part due to lower flow of public subsidies to households that is expected to resume in the second half. Consumer confidence remains strong in Mexico, while Brazil and the Western Andean countries continue to demonstrate solid growth. Latin America delivered OI growth of nearly plus 24%, supported by strong pricing.\nTurning to Page 16. In Q2, we saw strong double-digit OI and gross profit dollar growth, top line strength, pricing execution, ongoing cost discipline partly drove these results. Nevertheless, the strong half one results also reflect our favorable cocoa pipeline compared to current market prices, which will clearly reverse and will be a meaningful headwind in the second half.\nNext to EPS on Slide 17. Q2 EPS grew plus 25% in constant currency. Most of this growth was driven by operating gains as well as favorable cocoa cost pipeline and coverage strategies. And despite currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS and reported ForEx by more than 19%. We are holding our EPS goal for the year despite these gains since cocoa will become a more material headwind in the second half.\nWe continue to demonstrate strong free cash flow and capital deployment, as you can see on our Slide 18. We delivered EUR 1.5 billion of free cash flow in half 1. We have repurchased 1.1 billion in stock through half 1 and will remain opportunistic for the remainder of the year. We also announced today that we are raising our dividend by 11%, marking 9 consecutive years with a double-digit dividend increase.\nBefore moving to our outlook, let me make a few comments relative to Cocoa on Slide 20. As we know, this is the most likely top of mind for our investors. Our teams continue to monitor the market very closely to put ourselves in the best position possible. While we want to protect ourselves, we continue to put flexible structures in place that enable us to participate in potential market price declines versus current historically high prices.\nIn addition, we continue to fine tune our commercial strategies to ensure long-term sustainable growth while managing through near-term challenges. As guiding principles, we will protect critical price points and key thresholds, while broadly utilizing our GM and implementing more pricing in the least elastic segment and consumer occasions. Our objective is to limit elasticity and volume losses while protecting our gross profit dollars to the extent possible as we believe cocoa prices will adjust eventually.\nWe will also implement cost measures to ensure that we protect our bottom line and ability to invest in the category. It remains too early in the year to provide specifics around 2025. However, there are some key elements and points in time to consider. The mid-crop has been good and in line with historical trends. And although early signs around the main crop are encouraging, we should get a much clearer indication in September, which will likely act as the next catalyst for cocoa cost.\nAs we get to our Q3 earnings cycles, we expect to be able to share more color around market liquidity and the range of cost that will relative to 2025 as well as EPS. I'll close with our outlook on Slide 21. Our outlook for '24 remains unchanged. We continue to expect [ on algo ] delivery for revenue, earnings per share and cash flow. Note that this earnings per share include significantly higher costs related to Cocoa for the second half, which is important to factor into our 2 models. This includes the upper end of our 3% to 5% range for organic net revenue, which considers the impact of completing price negotiations in Europe and plans to drive improvement enough to result in North America. Most of our key assumptions remain consistent with what we shared with you in our last call with the exception of interest expenses, which is now estimated at EUR 275 million for the full year. With that, let's open the line for questions.",

With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO, and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements as we discuss our results today. Unless noted or reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call. Today I will start on slide four. I'm pleased to share that 2024 is off to a solid start with strong profit delivery. We posted solid top-line results in the first quarter coupled with strong earnings and free cash flow generation. We continue to see momentum in emerging markets where consumer confidence remains strong, and our categories remain resilient. There were a number of one-off factors that affected our sales in the quarter, such as the disruption with some of our European clients, and the boycott of western products in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\nWe delivered another quarter of strong gross profit dollar growth through ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing, and we also continued our track record of strong free cash flow generation of more than $1 billion this quarter to accelerate our strategy of global snacking leadership and drive sustainable long-term growth. We are continuing to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities, driving distribution gains and harnessing synergies from our recently acquired assets. While our operating environment remains challenging and dynamic, our teams are focused and agile in dealing with the short term as well as executing against our long term growth strategy. While surprising but temporary, the cocoa inflation does not affect the fact that our categories remain durable and our growth opportunities remain sizable. Turning to slide five, you can see that organic net revenue grew 4.2% this quarter with adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 11.6% enabling us to continue investing in the business. We continue to increase our ANC spending year over year in the high single digits, which is driving consumer and customer loyalty for our iconic global brands as well as our local jewels.\nAdjusted EPS grew 16.3%, and we generated $1 billion in free cash flow. While many food and beverage segments are showing softness so far this year and I'm now on slide six, our core categories of chocolate, biscuit, and baked snacks are still demonstrating relatively more resilience and lower elasticity than the broader food universe.\nConsumer confidence varies by region, with North America, Australia, and New Zealand mixed. While Europe is improving and emerging markets remain strong, shoppers in many markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to the absolute price point, driving them to choose smaller pack sizes in both biscuits and chocolates, and at the same time, consumers in our snacking categories remain very loyal to the brands that they know and love. In North America, we're seeing increased promotional intensity combined with a significant shift in sales to non-tracked channels, including club stores, dollar stores, and emerging e-commerce platforms. Lower income consumers feel pressured, and we see that pressure weighing on their frequency in the category, especially among brands that skew more to that group. In Europe, consumer confidence is stable while volume growth has slowed. The chocolate and biscuit categories are holding better than the broader FMCG landscape, and we're hearing increased optimism about the go forward economic outlook.\nEmerging markets remain a strong growth driver with consumer confidence driving resilient demand and low elasticity. Consumers in emerging markets are particularly interested in premium offers enabling us to expand our range with new on trend formats and pack sizes. Turning to slide seven, it is important to underscore that despite short-term marketplace volatility, we remain focused on advancing our long-term growth strategy by reinvesting in our brands and people, driving strong execution, reshaping our portfolio, and scaling sustainable snacking. We continue to increase our focus on our attractive and resilient core categories of chocolate, biscuits, and baked snacks, and we remain on track to deliver 90% of revenue through these core categories by 2030. For example, we're investing significantly to support our Cadbury brand's 200th anniversary in the United Kingdom this year with a multichannel consumer activation promoting the brand promise of generosity. At the same time, we're strengthening store availability, visibility, and execution around the world.\nDuring the first quarter alone, we added around 100,000 directly served stores in emerging markets. We are also harnessing the power of recent acquisitions by capturing synergies and driving growth. For example, we successfully completed a significant system integration in our Ricolino business this quarter, which boosts our ability to fully leverage the expanded routes to market in Mexico, particularly in the traditional trade. The combined Mondel?z and Ricolino system paves the way for significantly expanded distribution in key categories including chocolates. Additionally, we are making continued progress on our environmental and social sustainability agenda. Just a few weeks ago we earned validation for our net zero by 2050 roadmap from the Science Based Targets initiative, demonstrating that we are on the right path towards combating climate change.\nWe also deliver significant improvements in advancing our mindful snacking priorities including enhancing nutrient and ingredient profiles, promoting active lifestyles, and empowering consumers to make more mindful eating choices. I do encourage you to read our annual Snacking Made Right report, now available on our website to learn more about our sustainability strategy and to review our full year sustainability performance data. Before I turn the microphone over to Luca on slide eight, I'd like to spend a few minutes putting the recent headlines about cocoa prices and chocolate into perspective. We're playing for the long term in chocolates because it is fundamentally a great category with very high brand loyalty and low private label penetration. Within this great category our business is strong and agile. Record cost for cocoa ingredients and the resulting current and future price increases for customers and consumers obviously are generating substantial discussion.\nDespite this near term headwind, chocolate volume continues to grow and within this growing category we remain structurally advantaged with large opportunities still ahead. We are confident in our chocolate business for four main reasons: our cocoa coverage strategies, our approach to pricing, our supply chain, and our iconic brands. First, it is important to underscore that our coverage strategies have proven advantage versus market dynamics in the last few months. We are fully covered for 2024 and well protected heading into 2025. Our teams continue to monitor the market very closely to put ourselves in the best position possible, while poor weather and other factors on the supply and demand side have driven prices to unprecedented levels. We believe there will eventually be a market adjustment.\nWe are confident that our teams are putting in place the right strategies to provide future flexibility. Luca will provide some additional details in a few minutes. Second, we continue to implement sound pricing strategies, including both headline pricing and revenue growth management. We remain agile in balancing the need to offset inflation with the need to maintain solid volume dynamics. We are especially focused on protecting critical price points, including low unit price and other key threshold prices. Third, we remain confident in our supply chain.\nContinuity remains our top priority, and we are confident in both our own team and our partners with robust work streams to minimize the risk. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have some of the strongest, most iconic chocolate brands in the world, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Côte-d'Or, Marabou, Freia, and Lacta to name a few. These brands already are the leaders in numerous key markets and we are well positioned to accelerate growth in emerging markets. Our research shows that consumers remain extremely loyal to our great brands because chocolate plays an important role in their lives, helping to bring families together, celebrate key milestones, and to enjoy some quiet me time. In our annual state of snacking survey conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll, 72% of consumers across 12 countries said that a world without chocolate would be a world without joy. Nearly 60% said that they would rather give up social media for a month than give up chocolate.\nOur economic portfolio. Our iconic portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and advantaged geographic footprint make us particularly well positioned to take advantage of these consumer trends. In summary, we're confident that we are well equipped to navigate a relatively short-term headwind and that we're structurally advantaged to accelerate long-term growth in this category. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q1 was a solid quarter for our business with organic net revenue growth across each region, strong profit dollar growth, substantial reinvestment into A&C, and great free cash flow generation. Revenue grew 4.2% with strong pricing execution. Volume mix was varied for the quarter with emerging market flat despite being impacted by some political unrest in the Middle East and some production slowdowns in Mexico related to Ricolino being integrated into SAP. We expect both issues to subside throughout the year, and specifically, Ricolino is almost back on track. On the other side, developed market volume mix was down 3.6% for the quarter, being impacted mostly by Europe customer disruption and the US biscuit market softness.\nOn the customer front in Europe, we are happy to report that about 90% of the price is now implemented. One relevant customer alliance is still pending. Total revenue for emerging markets grew +8.3%, underpinned by strength across a number of key markets, while developed markets grew 1.4% with solid results from Europe despite customer disruption, and strength from our North America growth channels and Canada. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 11, biscuits and baked snacks grew 0.6% for the quarter. A number of brands delivered solid growth including Oreo, Ritz, and 7Days. On the flip side, we have seen ongoing softness in US biscuits delivered primarily by brands that have higher penetration among lower-income households such as Chips Ahoy!.\nThis dynamic has impacted frequency and contributed to the declining volume. Chocolate grew 5.8% with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Vol/mix was down 1.6% driven by customer disruption. In Europe, Cadbury Dairy Milk posted strong growth while we saw solid increases from Milka despite customer disruption. There is an element of Easter timing in these results, but we believe it to be immaterial. We also delivered solid growth with several of our local jewels, including Lacta in Brazil, Freia in Norway, Marabou in Sweden, and Hu in the US.\nGum and candy grew 12.9%, driven by continued momentum and strength in key markets, including China, Mexico, and Western India. Let's review market share performance on slide 12. We had or gained share in 40% of our revenue base with strength in chocolate as well as in gum and candy. This trend was offset by softer results in our US biscuits business. Turning to regional performance on slide 13, Europe grew 4.4% in Q1. Execution was strong in the quarter with a number of key countries delivering strong growth through solid pricing and excellent Easter execution, which led to share gains. This trend was partially offset by volume declines associated with expected customer disruption.\nWhile dollars were up more than 20% and including significant A&C investments, we have now landed the vast majority of pricing in Europe. One customer alliance is still ongoing, which will cause some additional disruption in Q2, but the business remains in line with our expectations. North America grew 1.3% against an exceptionally strong compare of more than 16% in Q1 last year. Growth channels including club, e-commerce, and Canada delivered strong results. However, overall volume mix declined as a result of ongoing softness, including mass. This softness has been consistent with the overall market, and driven primarily by less frequency from lower-income households.\nWe are working to ensure our offers and activations continue to provide value to these consumer cohort, and we continue to build that into our plans moving forward. We remain encouraged by our activation plans in key products such as Oreo, TDP expansion, and growth channels as we move through the year. North America increased by 2.1%. AMEA grew 5.9% for the quarter. China delivered another strong quarter with low double-digit growth fueled by initiatives to enhance brand equity in Oreo, Chips Ahoy, and Australia. India grew high single digits driven by continuous trends in chocolate and distribution gains, while Australia, New Zealand, and Japan also delivered a robust quarter for growth coupled with strong share gains.\nLike last quarter, volume costs in the Middle East and Southeast Asia impacted results. We believe this dynamic will begin to moderate in Q2 and remainder of the year. AMEA increased OI dollars by 20.2%, continuing a strong track record of top and bottom line growth. Latin America grew 7.1% with strong price execution and a slight volume mix decline of -1.2%. It's important to note that Argentina is now capped at 26% and this is not reflected in the base year comparison for Latin America. Argentina contributed more than 11 points to Latin America growth in Q1 2023 but only 1.8 points in Q1 2024, so we expect the underlying growth rate in LATAM to appear understated for this year. Having said that, reported dollars growth continued to be strong for this segment.\nVolume mix was softer in the quarter primarily due to some product availability in Mexico associated with the Ricolino SAP go live that resulted in some production temporary slowdowns. These issues are mostly behind us, but we're still working to rebuild inventory. Consumer confidence and demand in Mexico remain quite robust, and we expect to see improved volumes as supply chain catches up as Q2 progresses. Brazil continues to be strong both in terms of volume, mix, and revenue, while Argentina is impacted by unprecedented inflation and subsequent pricing and volume softness. Latin America delivered OI growth of more than 33%. Strong pricing and the continuation of gum and candy momentum drove these results.\nTurning to page 14, in Q1 we saw strong double-digit high-end gross profit dollar growth of more than $380 million driven by top-line strengths and ongoing cost efficiency. It is important to note that the impact of cost inflation will be a more significant headwind in the remaining quarters than what we saw in Q1 as a result of our favorable cocoa pipeline compared to the current market crisis. Next to EPS on Slide 15, Q1 EPS grew more than 60% in constant currency. Most of this growth was driven by operating gains, and despite some currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS at reported Forex by 10.5%. Turning to Slide 16 and cash flow, we delivered $1 billion of free cash flow for the quarter. We also repurchased $600 million in stock during the quarter.\nWe will continue to remain opportunistic for the remainder of the year as it relates to share buybacks. Our balance sheet also remains strong as leverage ended at about 2.5 times. Before moving to our outlook, let me take a moment to discuss cocoa on slide 18. First, our coverage strategies have proven advantageous versus market dynamics in the last few months. We are fully covered for 2024 and also for a portion of H1 2025. Typically we are covered for 12-plus months, but given recent volatility we have remained slightly shorter in duration.\nOur teams continue to monitor the market very closely to put ourselves in the best position possible. It is obvious that the series of conditions on both supply and demand sides have driven costs up at unprecedented levels. We believe there will eventually be a market adjustment, and while we want to protect ourselves, we are putting in place flexible structures that will allow us to participate to potential upside versus current historically high prices. On the other side, we continue to execute against our pricing strategies to offset input cost inflation using both headline price and revenue growth management. Chocolate has shown strong growth over the past several years with very durable volume and elasticity despite significant pricing, particularly as we have some of the strongest brand in the category. However, we will remain agile in our approach to pricing in order to balance the need to offset inflation with the need to maintain solid volume dynamics.\nThis means we will protect critical price points such as low unit price and key thresholds across our footprint. We also remain confident in our supply chain. Supply chain remains priority one, and we are confident in our supply chain and that of our partners. We don't go into work streams to minimize risks. Turning to our outlook on Slide 19, our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. We continue to expect strong delivery for revenue, earnings per share, cash flow. This includes the upper end of our 3% to 5% range for organic net revenue growth, which continues to factor in ongoing customer disruption in Europe and softer growth in parts of the US.\nMost of our key assumptions remain consistent with what we shared with you in our last call. We continue to expect high single-digit inflation in 2024. Although the vast majority of pricing has been landed in Europe, we continue to expect some level of customer disruption in Q2 associated with our annual price negotiation process. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $300 million for the year. We are expecting $0.10 of EPS headwinds related to forex impact. In terms of tax rates, we continue to expect adjusted effective tax rate in the mid-20s%. Share repurchase is expected to be $2 billion with an opportunistic approach.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press the star and one keys on your telephone keypad. Please note you may remove yourself from the question queue at any time by pressing star and two. Again, it is star and one to ask a question. Today, we'll take our first question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. You highlighted a few of the challenges in North America at the moment. Just as we think about the path ahead, maybe how are you considering some of the more important actions that can be taken to protect share? Maybe in light of some of the challenges at the lower end consumer and also given your comments about globally sort of protecting some of the price points that are out there. I'm just trying to get a sense for the tactics that might be implemented.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, Ken, hi. I mean you see that the category is slowing down and that we are losing a little bit of share. I think everybody knows that the consumer. It's sort of seeing a number of things. There is the persistent inflation, there is the high interest rate, there's the loss of the snap. There's also the recent not so great job market.\nConsumer confidence, which was so-so up to today. I think now we just learned that it took a real dive this month. We see in our categories the elasticity is really going up. Penetration is still pretty good, but people are much more conscious about price points. The frequency is coming down, particularly with the lower income consumers and particularly the brand that are important for them, like Chips Ahoy!, can see that they're losing some market share to private label. There is, as I just said, some trade down to private label.\nThen another thing to keep in mind is that there's some big channel shifts taking place to club, online, or the value channel. So what are we doing about it? The first thing is that we last year didn't have a great performance in TDP. So going forward we are increasing our TDP which will help our volumes going forward and our market share. For those lower income consumers who are buying very carefully and evaluating very carefully when and what and at which price they buy, we will need to become more agile in the promo mechanisms that we will play out. And we're working hard on finding what works best for us.\nAnd that's kind of different brand by brand and largely talking about what we do on our base packs here. We will continue to invest in our brands because we increased prices also in March. So we will increase our investment. We are launching a number of special packs, a number of additional multipacks, but also, for instance, in clif, we are reducing the size of our multipacks from six to five or from 12 to 10 units in a multipack, which will help the price point we're selling at. And so that gives you a little bit of an idea of what we're planning to do going forward. We assume that in the second half of the year the consumers will have a better confidence and that we will see gradually the volume and the market share to come back.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. And then, Luca, as we look at the remainder of the year, especially just modeling Q2 in particular, are there any unusual puts and takes that maybe aren't fully or properly factored into street forecast? Anything? We should be more considerate of that maybe we're not yet.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nI don't think that's necessarily the case, Ken. I mean, we feel good about reaffirming at this point our original guidance for 2024. While it is true that the biscuit category in the US is a little bit softer, we are overall happy with most of the dynamics we see around the world. Importantly for us, China, Chinese New Year, and Easter were quite good, and these are critical consumption events for us. You should expect categories to continue their trends into Q2 and the latter part of the year. I want to spend a minute talking about pricing.\nWe are at this point in total where we should be. We have implemented the price that we targeted everywhere, including Europe. We still have one main customer to finalize in Europe, which is leading to some disruption in Q2, so you should expect that. But overall, in terms of pricing, we are where we had anticipated to be by now. Inflation is in total in line with what we expected. And by now we have locked cocoa for the entirety of 2024.\nSo we have quite a good visibility on cost. I would have a special call out here because cocoa cost will escalate throughout the year, particularly in the second half. The acquisitions we started a little bit softer than expected, particularly in CLIF. And I called out some temporary issues in Ricolino, but you should see a sequential improvement throughout the year. Maybe another couple of points to bear in mind. Elasticities are planned in line with what we have seen in Q1, but we might see a little bit of an uptick, particularly in chocolate.\nBut as we mentioned a few times, we will continue to support our brands. We will not vacate critical price points, particularly in emerging markets. We have planned for the same type of softness that we have seen in Q1 as far as the biscuit category goes. But we would expect our share to improve over time as we are revisiting some of the promo mechanics, particularly around brands like Chips Ahoy!. I mentioned that Ricolino is already recovering, so we should see good growth in Latin America going forward. Finally, as far as earnings go, we continue to make progress in removing stranded cost related to the gum business.\nI don't expect any particular change in dynamics into Q2 specifically, but we should see, particularly on volume, some sequential improvement as we go through the year as we land some of the price negotiation, particularly in Europe.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nVery helpful, thank you.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks operator. Good afternoon, Dirk. Luca.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nHi Brian.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey. So just my first question is just can you give us a little bit more color, perspective on emerging markets? I mean, you know, you talk about in the press or you talk about in the prepared remarks how the elasticities have been pretty good considering how much pricing? So I guess as we're thinking about the balance of the year and just contribution to growth in the back half of the year, just give us a little bit more, if you can give us a little bit more color on emerging markets and how we should be thinking about that.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, well. Just to situate it, about 40% of our sales growth in emerging markets was about 8% in Q1. We are seeing growth in reported dollars, top and bottom line. So, solid robust performance. If I look at the different markets, China, we had low double-digit growth with strong share gains. You know that China for us is a combination of selling more in the stores.\nWe are already where we already are, but also a big drive in distribution that will continue for the rest of the year, and we expect that China will be strong. India, we had high single digits, same sort of dynamics continue to increase our share in the market and increasing our distribution. India probably won't show the same amount of growth that we've seen in previous year. We expect a bit of a slowdown there, but still expecting a positive year in India, then Mexico. Luca already commented. Mexico was a bit was low single-digit driven by some issues with the system implementation in the merging Ricolino with our business.\nBut we are gaining shares, our offtake is good. We had some issues in supplying the market, and now that the system is done, we will really start to work that route to market expansion. So we're expecting once we get through these short-term issues that we will see some strong growth in Mexico, and then Brazil was mid-single-digit gaining share, pretty good gain in distribution. Price points are a bit of a discussion there. But we also expect Brazil to look pretty good. So in the four biggest emerging markets for us, we feel pretty good about where they are and what we expect for the rest of the year. There are some watch-outs.\nThere is inflationary pressure in Nigeria, Pakistan, Egypt, in the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We have the boycotts of western products that are affecting us. So not everything is great. But we do believe that emerging markets this year will be giving us sustainable growth. We will get back to volume, volume growth. We feel that the low category penetration that we have and the distribution opportunity that we have will drive this.\nI think we are also gradually getting into the adjacencies and we are able at this stage to continue our virtuous investment cycle where we continue to increase our investment. Every year we get good growth, we generate more margin, and the year after we increase our investment. So overall it's not going to be an incredible year in emerging markets, but it's going to be a very successful, solid year for us in emerging markets.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks Dirk and Luca. Just one quick one on cocoa, I know here our trading desk kind of has a view that we might be closer to $5,000 by the end of the year. So I guess to the extent that there's an expectation that cocoa prices come down, does it pay for you to just wait to hedge? I guess it's kind of like shorting cocoa. But I think last year you might have held out until the middle of the year before you locking in. I'm just kind of curious how we should be thinking about and observing what you may be doing to start thinking about cocoa in 2025.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThat's a very good question. So we truly believe that current cocoa prices are the result of a series of accidental circumstances that over time we believe should go away. I think you all know that the main crop last year was problematic, but as you might have read from multiple sources, the mid crop is already looking much better. But also on the other side, on the demand side, the industry went a little bit shorter than usual on coverage, and now buying out of necessity to replenish minimum stocks really provide support to the current high prices. I think in this context we truly believe that the current market structure does not warrant the current market prices. And so the question becomes when is a correction going to take place.\nAnd most likely the answer is in September, October, as the data for the new crop becomes available. We cannot stay still until then. We will have to protect ourselves. But our implementation strategy for 2025 is around flexibility. And so we are putting in place very flexible structures, namely pure vanilla call options. We bought a few where price of those options was very affordable, I would say, particularly in light of today's prices.\nBut we are putting in place multiple structures that would allow us to participate in a potential market correction. So you're absolutely right. We believe the market is overreacting, that current prices are not sustainable. And should the correction happen, which we expect towards the end of Q3, most likely we will be ready to take advantage of lower prices. Now, I don't want to give you the false impression that we are not going to have inflation in cocoa in 2025, because reality is in 2024 we are covered at materially better prices than current market. So you might want to take a look at the total mark-to-market in the known cap to adjusted GAAP results.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, thanks, Luca, appreciate that. Yeah, we were looking at that. Actually. Pete Galbo pointed out to me just how big the gain was, so definitely get that piece. All right, I'll let you guys go. Thank you.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Food Beverages Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey there. Thanks for the question. I guess one of the more pleasant surprises is that European chocolate retail data looks very, very strong. The elasticity looks de minimis, and I want to know if you think that will help in your negotiations with retailers heading into 2025. Are the retailers happy with how the category is performing, how the consumer is handling the pricing so far? Does that help at all?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, of course, it does help in the sense that. So far the elasticity is relatively benign. We've got a good performance. Despite some disruptions, growth has been solid, I would say, and we have increased our market share. We do have to take into account that Easter came earlier. We had a very strong Easter from our side, but it came early. So some of the numbers you're seeing are influenced versus last year with an earlier Easter.\nBut overall, I would say that this certainly is better than you would have expected. So it shouldn't be a surprise in a way because we know that the chocolate market can be very resilient. We also are continuing to invest quite heavily, and consumer confidence in Europe, I would say, is stable. There is some uptick in elasticity, but overall. It's better than you would have expected and maybe even a little bit more positive than what we currently are seeing in US going forward. I think it helps to see a strong category that we are performing well.\nOf course, the retailers see the cocoa pricing as well as we do, so it will help the discussions going forward. I wouldn't say that it's going to be simple, but there will be an understanding that if cocoa prices remain relatively high that there will need to be more price increases that need to be implemented. And I think we're helped by the data that we can provide. And we also have to see what's going to happen with elasticity going forward as the new chocolate prices get implemented. Because when you have seasonal like Easter, the consumer not necessarily fully aware of the price difference when they start to see their tablets now in the normal shelf, that's when they will fully realize elasticity. So we will need to see where that is heading.\nBut overall, yes, very positive on what is going on with chocolate in Europe.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Food Beverages Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay, great, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks. Good evening, guys. Let's talk a little bit about the gross margin. I thought coming into this year you actually expected the gross margin to start out slower in the first quarter and actually sort of improve year over year as we went into the year. Seems like we're setting up for a different, maybe an opposite dynamic. So if you could just expand on what drove the gross margin higher this quarter and then how do you expect the cadence of gross margin to evolve over the course of the year?\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah. So as I said, both in the prepared remarks and in my first answer to Ken's question, we are very happy with the level of pricing we have taken so far. And so we are absolutely on plan on the cost side, I commented about the fact that the cocoa price escalation will be more visible in the second part of the year. So I'm not sure you will continue seeing, you know, the type of gross profit dollar expansion and gross profit margin that you saw in Q1 into the second half because the cocoa prices will hit a little bit harder in particular in Q4. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I think the way you have to think about it is are we happy with, you know, expanding gross profit dollars almost 12%.\nAbsolutely. Are you happy? Are we happy with the $40 gross profit that we see? Absolutely. We are pricing in a very disciplined manner around the world. We are doing RGM, so that is bearing its fruit. But you're going to see some compression, particularly in Q4, so don't expect like 2.5 points of gross profit expansion from now to the end of the year. For sure.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Okay, very good, thanks. And actually, Dirk, if I could build on your comments just a minute ago on Europe, I'm curious. I mean, understanding that the retail negotiations have gone maybe a little bit better than you had originally assumed, but it seems like demand, as you say, is stable. Maybe a little bit better than expected, I guess. Is it better than you would have expected? And if so, you know, how does that influence your plans for the balance of the year? Are you leaning in a bit, a bit, a bit harder into Europe to take advantage of those better conditions?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, I would say first of all, as it relates to the client negotiations, they largely are going exactly as we would have expected, as we know that we have, as we knew that we had increased prices. We foresee that in our forecast for the year, and at the moment it's playing out as expected. As Luca mentioned, there's still one buying group that we need to finish. Hopefully we will do that in the coming weeks, and then we should be done for a while. As it relates to the current situation in Europe, obviously there will be recuperation because we have not been delivering for a while some clients, and as we get agreements, we start to fill the pipeline again. So that will help us. But overall, I would say that we are not expecting to see for the full year.\nA big difference in our European performance. We're not expecting to see an upside. We are convinced that we have more stability, we feel more assured about delivering what we are expecting to deliver in Europe. But we're not counting yet on an upside for the year.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alexia, your line may be muted.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nLet's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi everyone.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nHi.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nDirk, in the comments that you made around the consumer in North America, elasticity is picking up a little bit, and some expectations into Q2 in the back half of the year. I guess I'm just trying to understand a couple of things. First, in Q1, is there anything within the portfolio that you would deem not elasticity related? You mentioned some competitive activity in CLIF that you're going to be responding to, say anything competitively or fundamentally that you would point to that you would see improving into Q2, where it gives you a little bit of confidence in North America. And then the second thing would just be regarding the consumer into the back half of the year. Did I catch you right?\nThat there's an expectation that the consumer in North America gets a little bit better and that your volume trends as such should improve sequentially. So perhaps just any help on portfolio dynamics in the quarter and also just, I guess, more of like the macro and the consumer.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah, well, I would say that if you look at the market share evolution. The brand that's most affected is Chips Ahoy!. Chips Ahoy! is the most susceptible to private label. An Oreo or a belVita are gaining market share. So I would say if there's anything that's pointing, I wouldn't call it necessarily not susceptible to elasticity. We see some elasticity on those brands too. But overall, the activations that we have and the interest we're getting from the consumer on those two brands offset the elasticity effect that we're having as it relates to what we need to do going forward.\nIt's largely now trying to figure out in which way can we get the frequency, particularly from the lower income consumers that we would like to see. So price points certainly play a role, and we will need to work short term with promotions, longer term, probably working on the size of our packs to make sure that we hit those right price points. Because if we see anything in the elasticity, it is that we have surpassed certain price points and that that is having a big effect now. I would say that movement is happening already. So that's what we gradually will expect to improve in the, in the coming months. That is that our promotional and pricing strategy gets better, that we understand better how to get the frequency and the volume from the consumer.\nI'm also expecting that the overall consumer confidence in the second half of the year will improve. That will have an effect for us. There is a lapping effect. Last year we had 16% growth in North America. Of course that plays a role. The lapping later in the year will be easier.\nThose are the things that I would see that make me believe that the second half of the year will look better for us in North America.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay, thank you. One quick follow up on cocoa. Luca, you gave a lot of helpful commentary around some of the things that you're going to be doing or are doing now contractually. You also have an expectation in September and October. I guess the question is, what if cocoa sustains these really high levels and we don't see the fundamental break expected going into next year. Is it still appropriate to think about pricing as the core mechanism to cover the inflation? Or, given the lead time that you have to prepare. Maybe there are other alternatives like accelerated savings, RGM, the sorts of things that you can do when you have many months to prepare for such cycles.\nIf indeed you believe that the cocoa prices at some point will eventually break. So it's just more game theory, but any context on that would be helpful.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah, I believe. It's absolutely critical for us to get ready for potentially cocoa staying at these levels. I just want though to call out one thing which is. The forward curve for cocoa is heavily inverted, and that means in general that even today we could potentially get physical coverage into 2025 at cheaper prices than the current spot price that we see today. But rest assured that as a company we are looking at all possible scenarios, and as a matter of fact, we are taking a fresher look at some of the costs we have, making sure that we try to understand the level of flexibility that we have. We are looking thoroughly into additional RGM. We will stay absolutely true to the concept of protecting price point, particularly in emerging markets.\nWe are not going to move the LUP low unit price points in India, for instance, but we will be looking into potential RGM in terms of promo, in terms of downsizing, et cetera. So to say that we will have to make sure that elasticity stays in control. In the end, we are going to be managing 2025 in light of what we think a more plausible cocoa level is, despite the fact that it might still be very high. Because we fundamentally believe that in a couple of years' time, tops, the cocoa price will correct. At that point in time, we will have to have retained our volume, our share, our competitive advantage both in developed and in emerging markets. That's the way we are looking at these.\nBut rest assured, you know, we are looking at all possible scenarios and we're going to be sitting down soon, soon with the teams to make sure that we put in place already all the possible actions that would allow us to go through a potential worst case scenario in 2025.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nRob, are you there?\n\nOperator\n\nWell, one moment, let me return. Yep, Rob, please check your mute function.\n\nRob Dickerson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, we can.\n\nRob Dickerson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOh great, thank you, sorry about that. So just one quick one on cocoa. Again, Luca. Just in terms of your comments around maybe the mid-crop coming in a little bit better, your kind of expectation, maybe things could ease and improve a little bit kind of in the almost pre-main crop period. Kind of what you're saying is just the expectation here is that supply should be up, right? We're clearly running a deficit, but then we should assume that supply should be up in the next main crop. Is that fair?\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, I think that's fair. I mean when you look closely at the numbers, Ivory Coast and Ghana, the main crop was down year on year and about 20%. The total cocoa supply was positive, as we are aware, in total it was down minus 10%. Do I expect the main crop to be down 20% in Africa or 10% in total? Again, I don't think that's a plausible scenario at this point in time, but as I said we will know more as we get closer to the main crop. But fundamentally nothing has really happened that structurally impairs the production capability of Africa specifically to that level.\nSo yes, I'm optimistic that there will be a better main crop and I think you will see prices for cocoa adjusting. Having said that, we are looking into all possible scenarios and we're going to be implementing some non regret opportunities that we see before year end, but we'll have to wait for us to be able to tell you what those are. I think as we move throughout the year we'll keep you updated on what we see for cocoa into 2025.\n\nRob Dickerson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nAll right, lovely. And then just quickly on the top line. I think originally Q1 you had said might be below the algo for the year, just kind of given some of the European disruption. But I think Europe did better than we all probably saw it. North America is a bit softer. So I'm just curious, are you still thinking there could be slightly positive volume mix for the company for the year?\nAnd then I think you also said likely for each of the segments once we X out some of the European disruptions. And then lastly I think you had also originally said it was probably more high end of the 3% to 5% sales growth. So just curious in the volume piece and then if you're still at the high end.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nLook, the volume piece is, we expect volume to be flattish for the year. Reality is, as we gave guidance, we had a little bit of headroom as you might expect. I think that headroom is still for the most part there. We'll have to see how a couple of ticket items play out for the remainder of the year. Particularly the boycott in AMEA as it relates to some of our brands. How will that play out in the quarters to come?\nAnd the other thing is the share recovery, particularly in the US. I feel confident about the plans that the US is putting in place. I think we are moving a little bit the price point of Chips Ahoy!, and that would allow us to recuperate share and volume and Chips Ahoy is the number one driver of the volume declines that you see in the North America segment. But then we will have to see how elasticity plays out as well. I feel quite good about the Latin America business. As I called out, I think three out of the four business units, and the only one that is declining in volume in real terms is Argentina. But the other three are doing quite well.\nWe feel good about China, I think, India. We're going to see some slowdowns, but all in all it should be fine. And then, you know, I could go around the globe and tell you that reality is once we land the final customer in Europe, we hopefully see some repiping of the straight stock and hopefully the chocolate market will continue displaying acceptable elasticity. So a long answer to say expect flattish volume. But reality is there are some puts and takes and we want to keep some flexibility within the plan.\n\nRob Dickerson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondel?z Management and the question-and-answer session. In order to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone at any time during the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel?z. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Mondel?z International\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO, and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today we sent out our press release and presentation slide, which are available on our website. During this call we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements as we discuss our results today. Unless otherwise noted, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a Constant Currency Basis unless otherwise noted.\nYou can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nThanks, Shep. Thanks to everyone for joining the call. Today I will start on slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered our best year ever in 2023 with robust top line growth, continued share improvements, record profit dollar growth, and strong total shareholder return. Our double digit top line performance was driven by strong pricing execution and positive volume mix growth. We also delivered continued share improvement as consumers across the globe remain very engaged with our iconic snacking brands. We set another record for Gross Profit Dollar growth achieving $2.2 billion. Through ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing to offset cost inflation as well as volume leverage, we continued our track record of strong Free Cash Flow generating $3.6 billion.\nTo accelerate our strategy of global snacking leadership, we continue to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities, driving multi-year growth on both the top and bottom lines. I'm especially proud of our record financial results as well as returning nearly $4 billion in capital to shareholders. These results deepen our confidence that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued and increasing investments, and especially our great people position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2024 and beyond. Turning to slide 5, you can see that 2023 was a strong year on both the top and bottom lines with substantial reinvestment to drive continued growth in the year ahead. Organic net revenue grew 14.7% or $4.6 billion versus prior years. Our continuing solid performance in volume mix demonstrates that consumers continue to prioritize our brands and categories.\nWe also delivered record adjusted Gross Profit Dollar growth of 2.2 billion, up 18.8%, significantly lapping the last several years. We're proud of our team's continued focus and commitment, which enables us to continue investing in the business to drive further sustained growth. Accordingly, we increased A&C investments by more than 21%, helping to drive consumer and customer loyalty to both our iconic global brands and our local jewels, which represent the taste of the nation in their markets. These results translated into strong OI growth of nearly $1 billion, up more than 19% versus prior years. Adjusted EPS grew 19% on top of strong growth in the past several years. All told, we remain confident that our Virtuous Cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, fueling local first commercial execution, and increasing investments in our strong brands, capabilities, and talent will enable us to continue delivering attractive sustainable growth.\nI'm especially proud to share that we continue to outperform our peers in total shareholder return. As you can see on slide 6, our 5-year TSR is nearly double the average of our peer group. Our one-year return is particularly impressive with Mondel?z delivering double-digit growth while our peer average return has fallen into negative territory. We view these results as evidence that we have the right strategy, the right brands, and the right people to continue delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. Switching to slide 7, our performance in 2023 gives us confidence that we have not only the right growth strategy, but also the right execution to deliver it. Here are just a few highlights of our strategy in action. Our biggest global brands Oreo, Milka, and Cadbury achieved more than $10 billion in global net revenues.\nWe continue accelerating our focus on our core categories for chocolate, biscuits, and baked snacks because these categories offer attractive growth and profitability. We remain on track to deliver 90% of our revenue through these core categories. We also continue to make strong progress in executing our growth strategy. Our US supply chain has stabilized and we have added more than 600,000 stores to our emerging market distribution channels. Additionally, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping strategy. In 2023, we integrated Clif Bar and Ricolino. Now we are harnessing the power of these recent acquisitions to strengthen our presence in the global snack bar and the Mexican chocolate and candy segments.\nWe also completed the sale of our developed markets gum business for $1.4 billion, providing another important source of reinvestment to further advance our brand's talents and capabilities. On slide 8, along with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress towards our sustainability goals and targets in 2023. First, we continue to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourced critical ingredients. About 80% of the cocoa volume used in our chocolate brand is sourced through Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program that works to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa grows. We also made continued progress in helping to combat climate change. We achieved an important milestone in 2023 by submitting our roadmap to achieve Net Zero by 2050 to the Science Based Targets initiative. Additionally, we continued advancing our light and right packaging strategy.\nMore than 97% of our packaging now is designed to be recycled. We also continue investing in ways to empower consumers to make more mindful snacking choices that fit into their healthy active lifestyles. More than 55% of our snacks revenue comes from mindful portion snacks, i.e., snacks that are packaged in individually wrapped mindful portion serving sizes or with clear mindful portion recommendations on pack. These are just a few highlights of our continuing progress towards building a more sustainable snacking company. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for our stakeholders. We encourage you to watch our annual Snacking Made Right Report, which will be published in April, to view our full year sustainability data.\nTurning to slide 9, you can see that like many companies, we continue to navigate through a dynamic operating environment. We are closely tracking and planning around a number of near-term themes including continuing inflation, shifting consumer habits, geopolitical challenges, rising cocoa prices, just to name a few. We are well positioned to address these challenges and we remain confident that we can deliver a non-algorithm year. Our confidence is rooted in our conviction that we have the right strategy, the right execution and the right people as well as very strong, widely loved brands. We continue to see momentum in the majority of our key emerging markets. Our categories remain resilient and our solid volume mix performance demonstrates that consumers continue to prioritize our iconic snacking brands. To continue accelerating this momentum, we're continuing to increase our investment significantly in our brands and capabilities.\nWe are pleased that our US supply chain has substantially improved, and we continue to focus on expanding distribution opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. We're also making solid progress in our European pricing negotiations. We expect to deliver robust EPS growth in both constant and real dollars in 2024, and overall, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to effectively navigate today's volatile environment while continuing to focus on long term sustainable growth. In conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2023 was another record year. Our focus and portfolio reshaping strategy is working, and we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth in 2024 and beyond.\nBy continuing to double down on our attractive core categories of chocolate biscuits and baked snacks, investing in our widely loved brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline, and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our financial results and the 2024 outlook, it is important to provide some context related to the developed market gum divestiture and its impact on our results. On slide 11, you can see that the impact of the divestiture on revenue was around about $500 million, while on growth 0.3 percentage points. Negative EPS was impacted by -$0.11. I'll give you more color as this relates to the outlook later in the call and how we plan to fully offset impact on income. Moving to slide 12, in 2023 we delivered exceptional results, starting with double-digit revenue growth with both volume and value contributing. As we keep saying, gross profit dollar is the most important P&L variable as it allows to reinvest and protect on our Virtuous Cycle.\nLast year GPD grew by $2.2 billion, allowing substantial reinvestments, strong earnings, and robust cash flow generation. The strength of these results can be seen across all regions and categories. Revenue growth was +14.7% in the year, with 1.3 points of growth coming from volume mix for the quarter. Growth was about 10% with a slight decline in volume mix. Emerging market grew by 20.4% for the year and 14.9% for the quarter with trends coming from a substantial number of key countries including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and the Western Andean. Developed market grew +11.1% for the year and +6.66% for the quarter, including robust growth from both the US and Europe. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 13, our chocolate and biscuits businesses both delivered double digit growth for the year. Also, gum and candy continued to perform well with superior growth in emerging markets.\nBiscuits grew plus 11.9% for the year and plus 5.5% for the quarter. A large number of brands delivered strong growth for 2023, including Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Belvita, Tate's Bake Shop, Give & Go, 7Days, Tuc, and Club Social. Chocolate grew plus 14.5% for the year and plus 11.2% for the quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was up by 2.5% for the year and 2.4% for the quarter. Global brands like Cadbury, Dairy Milk, Milka, and Toblerone all deliver extraordinary growth while we also deliver strong growth with many of our local jewels, including Lacta, Ricolino, and Côte d'Or. Gum and Candy grew more than 28% for the year and 20% for the quarter. Key markets including Brazil, Mexico, China, and the Western Andean all performed well. Let's review market share performance on slide 14.\nWe had or gained share in 65% of our revenue base with strong results in both chocolate and biscuit. Given the amount of pricing we took in the last couple of years, we see this as a strong accomplishment, and our brand investments, both from a quantity and quality standpoint, clearly played a role. Turning to regional performance on Slide 15, Europe grew +14.5% for the year and +11.6% for the quarter. Strong execution led to positive volume mix for the year despite significant customer disruption in Q2. Profit in 2023 was up +12.8% for the year and +1.6% for the quarter. Underlying profit in Europe continues to improve, but Q4 was negatively impacted by forex fluctuations on some cash deposit held in dollars that function as a protection against currency volatility.\nExcluding these headwinds, EBITDA in Q4 was up nicely despite a significant increase in A&C. North America grew +9.5% for the full year while Q4 grew +1.9% against an exceptionally strong compare of almost 20% in 2022. Full year growth was driven by higher pricing, broad-based trends across brands and channels, and solid volume mix. In Q4, volumes declined as a result of softening US biscuit category, tight inventory management in advance of Q1 pricing, and declines in Give and Go business. Give and Go was impacted by our decision to delist some of the holiday gingerbread kits given low profit. We continue to be very happy with Givengo overall. Clif results were driven by lower bar consumption and inventory depletion connected to retailers building inventory in Q3 to minimize potential disruption ahead of a system transition in early October.\nAs a result, we made adjustments to inventory, driving a year over year shipment decline. We feel comfortable with current inventory levels along with our programming and investments to drive 2024 growth. Overall, we are confident regarding our prospects in 2024 for North America given our strong activation plans, TDPs, expansion growth channels, and substantial investments in A&C. We are going to give you a better sense of these opportunities. At CAGNY, North America OA increased +22.7% for the year due to strong pricing and solid volume. For the quarter, OA increased by 9.5%. AMEA grew 11.7% for the year and 7.9% for the quarter. India grew strong double digits for the year and quarter, driven by both chocolate and biscuits. China grew high single digits for the year and quarter as well.\nSoutheast Asia grew mid single digits for the year, and Australia delivered strong results for both the year and the quarter as it relates to volume mix performance in the region for Q4. There has been some pressure on Western consumer brands in the Middle East since the war began, and we have not been immune from that with an impact to sales in the Middle East and part of Southeast Asia. We are supporting colleagues who have been impacted in different ways around the world as well as working with NGO partners to aid in humanitarian efforts in the region. While volatile and difficult to predict on a go forward basis, we are tracking the situation and working with stakeholders, and planning for these dynamics.\nIn our 2024 outlook, AMEA increased OI by 14.5% for the year and 18.5% for the quarter, continuing a strong track record of annual top and bottom line growth. Latin America grew 34.8% for the year and 28.6% for the quarter with strong volume mix growth and strong price execution. Ex Argentina growth for LA was plus 18.1% for the year and 9.2% for the quarter, testifying to the good work done by our teams. Beyond price management in Argentina, Latin America delivered another strong year of profitability. OI grew plus 48.5% for the year and more than 49% for the quarter. Strong volume mix, pricing, and combination of gum and candy momentum drove these results. Turning to page 16, for the year we delivered strong double-digit high-dollar growth driven by a record high increase in gross profit of nearly $2.2 billion.\nThis growth has enabled strong levels of reinvestment behind brands and capabilities for 2024 and beyond. In Q4 we also saw strong double-digit high and Gross Profit Dollar growth of more than $500 million driven by top line strength and ongoing cost discipline. Other was impacted by the forex dynamics and FX protection in US dollar that I discussed about Europe. Next, the EPS on slide 17, full year EPS grew +19% in Constant Currency. The vast majority of this growth was driven by operating gains, and despite currency headwinds we grew Adjusted EPS at reported FX by 14.3%. Adjusted EPS would be $3.30 per share including $0.11 of contribution from DM Gum. I'll talk more about our plans for 2024, but we will aim at removing as much Stranded Cost as possible.\nTurning to Slide 18, we delivered $3.6 billion of Free Cash Flow for the full year, including the impact of more than $380 million related to cash taxes from the liquidation of our KDP stake. Our balance sheet remains quite strong as full year Leverage ended at 2.6 times. Let me take a moment to discuss our outlook and some of our key planning assumptions on Slide 20. For the current year, we expect to deliver on our long-term algorithm for revenue, earnings and cash flow. We expect to be at the upper end of our 3% to 5% algo range for organic net revenue growth as pricing in certain markets with significant chocolate portfolios such as Europe is expected to be higher than historical levels. We expect Free Cash Flow of $3.5 billion plus.\nIn terms of the assumptions for inflation, we expect a high single-digit increase for 2024. This inflation is driven by significant increases in both cocoa and sugar, as well as another uptick in labor costs. As Europe faces more inflation than any other market, we expect customer disruption during Q1 and potentially into Q2 associated with our annual price negotiation process. This process is happening earlier in some cases than last year, so impact might be more pronounced in Q1 for top- and bottom-line. We also remain committed to substantial brand support in this region and all the others, similar to our stance over the last several years. In terms of interest expenses, we expect approximately $325 million. We are expecting $0.03 of EPS headwinds related to forex impact for the year. In terms of taxes, we expect an ETR in the mid-20s.\nShare repurchase expectations are around $2 billion. Turning to our EPS outlook on page 21, with respect to Adjusted EPS, we expect high single-digit growth of our reported base of 2023 of $3.30 per share, which include the $0.11 of contribution from our divested developed gum business. We expect to eliminate nearly all of these $0.11 impact by removing stranded costs. In fact, we made good progress by already realizing these cents of stranded cost savings in late 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press the Star and one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star two once again, that is Star one to ask a question. We will pause for a moment to allow questions to queue.\nOur first question comes from Andrew Lazar, Barclays.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nEverybody.\nDirk, I was hoping we could get a bit of a State of the Union on how you see the performance in key markets at this stage. As we saw a bit more volume weakness in North America in Q4 and conversely it still seems like there's strength in many of the other key markets. Trying to get a sense of how you see this playing out in 2024 and whether similar cadence across your markets might be the same or where it might be a bit different. And then I've just got a follow up.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nOkay, thank you Andrew. Yeah, I mean we see there's a very strong full year performance.\nWe feel that there is portfolio strength which is broad based across our regions, across the categories, across the brands.\nThe volume mix growth is solid for the year. We expect that to continue into next year.\nOur price execution has been very good this year across the business. Share performance is good. North America, we recovered, AMEA, we've been gaining share. Europe, we had some disruption effect during the year, but we've started to recuperate strongly at the end of the year.\nThe strength in emerging markets continues broadly. I can comment a little bit on.\nWhere there are some short-term issues.\nAnd then we've got some very strong Gross Profit Growth and $2.2 billion for the year, which has allowed us to reinvest quite significantly in the business, and so the acquisitions are doing well. Adjusted EPS growth 19% real, 14%; strong cash flow. So we feel good as we enter 2024. We have some more pricing coming in, but in North America that's already agreed. In Europe we're in line with where we were last year, and the majority is all already agreed. We are planning to continue with strong investments in our brands with strong activations, the acquisitions we expect to continue to play a big role for us. So overall, and maybe another point to mention is that we have the distribution runway of adding distribution for our brands around the world.\nSo we feel it was a very strong 2023 and we feel good entering 2024. Now that doesn't mean that there are no particular issues that are on our mind. So the first one would certainly be the cocoa prices and our need to.\nPrice as needed. We are well covered for the year, but we need to mainly in Europe get those prices agreed. Consumer, while the consumer is feeling better and more positive short term, we see that elasticity is still at or below historical norms. But there is some uptick in consumer elasticity in some spots around the world.\nIt is to be expected that we will have customer disruption in the beginning of the year. In Europe, the annual negotiations are in progress. Like I said, we are in line where we were last year, and majority is agreed, but we still have some to go. Then maybe a few words on some of the effects on the volume in Q4, which we don't think will continue in Q1 in certain instances. So there is some tensions in the Middle East, and that has some effect on Western brands, and we have some of those Western brands. We expect that to continue in Q1 and Q2, but gradually over the year that will fade away. That is the main reason why AMEA is not as strong in volume mix as you would expect.\nAnd then North America, Luca said it in the comments, particularly in the US because of very specific one-off reasons.\nStopping part of the range of Give and Go, the systems change in Clif. We expect to return to good volume mix growth in North America in the beginning of next year. All these items that I'm talking about are included in our full year outlook. And so we believe at this stage, particularly since we have to see how the negotiations go in Europe, that we should guide towards our own algorithm for 2024, probably more towards the higher side. But we are going to continue with all the things I said, and we'll see how the negotiations go in Europe. That's probably the main question mark that we have at this stage.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, great, thank you. And a quick follow up for Luca, and some of this you covered a little bit, Dirk, but I think there was a street expectation for organic sales growth for 2024 to maybe be a little bit above the 3% to 5% long term algorithm, just given the pricing that you're taking. So maybe Luca, you could walk us briefly through some of the just key puts and takes to keep in mind as we think about the sales growth guidance for the year and maybe the phasing aspect of it. Thanks so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Andrew. I would start by saying that guidance for 2024 in our mind is solid. Particularly we look at what drove 2023 and the continuation of that momentum into 2024, and so we can, I believe, count on resilience of our categories. We're happy. As I said in the prepared remarks on our share performance, I think you will see momentum in our share, particularly in the first half, and that is related to the unprecedented A&C investment we put forward. There are still material distribution opportunities that will help us model through some of the challenges that we discussed in the prepared remarks. And finally, the acquisitions I think will continue to be accretive for us both in terms of top line and bottom line decomposing the revenue guidance. Pricing is clearly a key component of this plan.\nIts contribution will be a little bit less than we have seen in 2023, but it is higher than an average year. Particularly as we price our way, cocoa chocolate will contribute to most of the pricing in 2024. Pricing, as we mentioned, presents a couple of challenges. One is potential customer disruption in Europe. We have planned for it. Part of it is also in the base of 2023. But while I feel positive and Dirk said more than half of the prices is secured at this point, we cannot really say what is going to happen. And particularly as we look into Europe, clearly we don't know.\nCustomer disruption. Having said that, I think it is important to realize that our brands are strong and that they drive significant traffic for retailers. So, couple that with the fact that pricing is common to the market, and many competitors will have to price. I think we feel, we feel quite positive at this point in time, quite frankly. The second one is elasticity, for which I feel better because competitors, as I said, will have to price too, but also because our brands are unique and we have been investing quite a bit. We expect for the year volume to be mildly positive with a good contribution actually when we exclude the customer disruption. So, at this point in time, given we don't control the level to which customer disruption will affect the plan, we want it to be a little bit on the cautious side.\nAnd look, reality is if we push this through and we are successful, most likely there will be revenue upside. And so as I said, we feel good. Importantly, I want to say North America; we have very good plans as we go into 2024. And I think the lineup of all these plans plus the continuation of the momentum in the acquired platforms is good. I want to say Latin America in our case continues to be good. AMEA, despite some of the challenges, has a lot of momentum in India and China. That will continue. And finally, I think if you look at Europe excluding customer disruption, the underlying business and the categories are doing well. So I believe the year will play out well for us, depending obviously on the extent of customer disruption.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks so much.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Goldman, JPMorgan.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nHi Ken.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nHi Ken.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nKen, hi. I just wanted to clarify a little bit about the EPS guidance. So it's on algo off a $3.30 base, but it's actually above algo if we think about it on a like for like basis versus the $3.19. Right. If you exclude gum from both 2023 and 2024. And please correct me if that's not accurate. I'm just curious what would necessarily what gives you the confidence it'll be a little bit above algo just on that like for like basis and maybe how much of that underlying is sort of the elimination of some stranded cost as you think about it, that might just give a little bit more of a boost to the year than we might typically have.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah, thank you for the question, Ken. We wanted to make sure.\nIt was clear that we are trying to eliminate all the stranded costs, and so we really wanted to guide high single digit of the higher base. The confidence comes from the fact that, as I said, we're going to have extreme excluding the customer disruption, good volume momentum into the business, and that provides leverage. We will continue pricing in a very disciplined manner, and that will offset the material inflation that we see clearly. We will continue with cost discipline and productivity. The fact that we will eliminate 70, 80% of the stranded cost into 2024 allows us to guide to a high single digit of a higher base in all this algo. We are not going to have, I have to say, 20% A&C increase another year, but it will be most likely high single digit or double digits.\nSo we will continue investing across all the regions, across all the brands, and so we feel good about that. Remember finally that through the integration of Ricolino, there will be some synergies coming to fruition. We are literally going live with SAP in a few days, and hopefully that will unlock both revenue and cost synergies for 2024.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. And then quick follow up. You mentioned disruption a little bit more in Q1 this year with the understanding it's quite early. Is there any way we can get a little bit more of a quantitative sense just to how to think about some of the impact potentially on the top and bottom line in the quarter? I realize like I said, it's impossible to kind of completely forecast it at the time, but just any kind of magnitude at this point would be helpful as we think about our models, perhaps.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nLook, I think as you look at the Q1 revenue pacing, we're going to have a revenue maybe number that is a little bit below the full year algorithm. I think you're going to be hopefully happy with the numbers you see across three regions out of the four. Europe is going to be more impacted in relative terms versus the impact that we have already in the base in 2023 in Q2.\nAnd most likely volume mix excluding the customer disruption is going to be a nice number and positive. I believe total volume mix might be tilted to slightly negative because of the disruption, but I can't go any further than that. We are in the middle of negotiations and conversations with retailers, and we have planned, we have a sense of what might happen, but time will tell exactly how we will land pricing in Europe.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Spillane, Bank of America.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good afternoon, Dirk. Luca.\nLuca, just a couple. Hey. I have a couple of questions actually, and one is just getting back to the guidance, and I just want to tie in. It's a $2 billion share repurchase this year, but you also repurchased quite a bit of shares in Q4. So if we think about the impact that share repurchases or a lower share count would have on fiscal 2024, it should be more than the roughly 2% that a 2 billion repo would suggest. Just simply because the timing of your 2023 share repurchases were so late, it should drive the share count down a little bit more than we would normally see. I just want to make sure, thinking about that correctly.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nI think you're thinking about that correctly. Yes.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. All right. Because that's going to square to just how much we need to burden operating profit growth. And I think it's not going to be quite as high as I think as it would have sort of looked. Okay, thanks for that. And then the second question, just Luca, if you could talk a little bit about Argentina. It's been topical over this earnings season for companies operating there. We've seen a range of outcomes, I guess, or actions companies have taken. So if you just kind of walk us through Argentina, does the devaluation at all have any effect on local operations? What's incorporated into the guidance? And also maybe if you can just touch on, is that what's driving the FX guidance to be so moderate? Because we fielded that question a bunch over the last few minutes. Thanks.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nSo Argentina for us is around about a $600 million business. We're very happy the way the business has been managed over the years. We have a clear playbook. What matters in Argentina for us is not necessarily top-line growth. It's not share; it is about protecting the cash that we have there. Argentina has been consistently generating cash for us, and we have been able also to take some cash out of the country. Some of the companies have talked about exposure or net monetary position. Our net monetary position is in control. It will go down over the course of 2024 as we have a clear playbook. By the way, we incent Argentina not like all the other business units, but we incent Argentina on net monetary position and Free Cash Flow generation.\nThere was a little bit of a spike in net monetary exposure in Q4, and that was as the old government put in place some price control mechanism. But as those have been released, the net monetary position in Q1 is going to be very manageable, and I don't expect any major impact due to that. It's also fair to say that we have full control of the operation. We are free to price at this point in time, and the team is fully committed to protecting as much as they can the size and the scale of Argentina. So I don't see any issues or whatsoever in terms of impairment. Clearly there has been material devaluation. The parallel market runs at rates that are even higher than the official one reported, that are obviously already much higher than last year.\nAnd so we will have to cap most likely growth for Argentina going forward into 2024. Having said that, it becomes a moot point as we guide you to organic net revenue growth and forex impact. And so the two offset each other. And if you take the guidance we gave in terms of organic net revenue growth and the impact on revenue, which is around about half a point of growth, you know, that should do the trick in terms of you forecasting Mondel?z in total.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Luca.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThanks. A couple of questions on Europe and pricing. So often we talk about the retailer customer and the dynamic of getting through pricing there. I wonder.\nAs you're taking pricing this year, is your pricing strategy to offset the dollar impact that you're going to see from cocoa?\nIt would seem like that would be a pretty reasonable expectation for the players there, given what's happening with cocoa. But maybe there's some timing issues for 2024 there to think about, and then. And then how, from what you've seen about the consumer, there is the pricing less price elasticity there much different than what you would see.\nFrom what you see in your biscuit business in the US for example.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah.\nYour first assumption is correct in the sense that we are trying to offset the dollar impact of the inflation that we're seeing on our input costs, and we're not pricing for percentage margin, but offsetting that dollar impact, which, yes, we believe is a reasonable position. I think this year, seeing the situation in Europe and the fact that the retailers are seeing probably some deflation in other areas of their business, it is a little bit of an explanation to explain that not only cocoa but also sugar or hazelnut are showing significant inflation, which is not the expectation. I think by now they understand that it has to happen in chocolate. So we have high hopes that we will be able to land that in a good way. As it relates to.\nElasticity, I would say the elasticity in Europe has been very reasonable. We might maybe expect a little bit of an uptick as prices keep on going up for a third year in a row, particularly in chocolate. But there is very little or low down trading within the category because everybody will have to price. So it's a joint movement of all the brands. So we don't expect that there will be huge differences between different brands and no shifting of consumers.\nWhat we've seen in the past year is a strong price increase of 12% to 15% in Europe in chocolate with a very limited 0% to 0.5% effect on volume. So that shows that the elasticity is very low. We think that is driven because of strong brand loyalty. The fact that chocolate has a very distinct taste profile and consumers tend to stick with their chocolate brand because they like taste and people recognize the taste of their brand. So private label is very small and people do not tend to switch brands very easy. We call it the taste of the nation. Every country has their favorite chocolate and then on top of that we will do significant investments, very strong activations. We've been driving seasonals very hard. The next year we will celebrate 200 years of Cadbury, which will be a major activation in the UK.\nAll that combined make us believe, and we have proved in the past that the elasticity will be limited, in our opinion, in chocolates in Europe.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nA quick follow up on distribution growth seems to be a key driver, a growth driver for the company. I don't think I've ever heard you say how much of your organic sales growth will come from distribution expansion. But if you had to guess how many percentage points of that organic sales targets would come from that, what would you say?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nWell, roughly, you can assume for the markets where we can derive significant numerical distribution. I'm talking about in China, India, but we are now also starting to drive very hard in places like Brazil.\nWe probably in those markets, you can expect that about 50% of our organic growth is driven through distribution expansion. On a global basis, we're probably talking about 2% of our extra growth coming from this. The runway of this is still quite big to give you a few numbers. So since 2019 we've added 1.7 million stores in China, India, and Brazil. But for instance, our biscuits are now in about 3 million of the potential 6 million stores in China. Or our gum business is only in 2 million of the 6 million potential stores. In India, we've added 180,000 stores in 2023; we deployed 100,000 new Visi coolers. But there is over 900, sorry, 9 million retail outlets. We cover directly 2 million, and we have about 3 million that are indirect coverage. So we're in 5 million of the 9 million stores in India.\nI can go out on different countries. I gave you the percentages, what it means for us. The other message here is that the runway, the years that we can keep on doing this are quite significant going forward.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThank you very much. That's great.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you, David.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thanks. I actually had a follow up on the distribution question.\nAre you taking extra steps to monitor distribution levels at distributors or even the retailers?\nIn light of volatility of consumption? There's been multinationals who have.\nFallen into inventory deloading situations. In LatAm, you're expanding distribution so. Well, I'm just wondering if you were also taking extra steps to monitor it at the same time.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, yes, we are aware that the distribution expansion needs to be very well monitored. So what we're putting in place is.\nA direct connection because we use mainly distributors to make this happen. It's a direct connection to their system so we can read what they sell per store and what the sell in is, how much the replenishment is. So we monitor that very carefully. We go slow in some of the cities where we're doing the expansion so that we make sure that we can see that setting up the whole distribution system is profitable and that it can be maintained. So we've had no surprises so far. I've done this many times in my career and I've had surprises, but so far things have gone quite smoothly. I think our teams around the world know what to do. They're on top of it. We usually accompany these distribution expansions with very heavy activation in the cities that we are doing this.\nWe feel pretty good that we have a very controlled way of doing it. Like I said, so far we've had no surprises whatsoever with this.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nA follow-up on that in some of these markets you've introduced more digitized tools to enable small retailers or distributors to order or reorder and also monitor their performance on promotions, I think. Has that improved your ability to keep track of distribution and monitor sales? Are the tools better than they were 10 years ago to monitor all this?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, we are still in a relatively experimental phase with that. We are, for instance, mainly experimenting with this in Latin America, largely in channels that we don't have immediate big coverage. So as an example, I would say bars in Brazil would be typically something that we don't cover directly or indirectly at the moment. But we have started to have a presence and we are monitoring how that is going. I would say those tools help you help the retailer order directly and get our products in there. It helps us to understand how much the store sells. And yes, we can monitor promotions as a tool to monitor how our distribution is evolving.\nIt's probably complementary to the other system I was talking about, but we prefer at this stage to monitor that through our distributors because the way it works is they will order through this new app and then we, through our normal distribution system, will deliver or we will use a third party to do it. So that's usually the source of the monitoring of distribution, not necessarily the new app for us.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nI got it, thank you.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYes, thanks. Thanks for the question, Luca. I think based on the EPS guidance combined with the $3.5+ billion Free Cash Flow guidance.\nTowards the $3.5 billion, kind of ignoring the plus. If I focus on the $3.5 billion, I think it implies a 75% or lower Free Cash Flow conversion. I just wanted to kind of throw that past you and see if that's the message you intended to convey. If so, what might be some of the drags on that Free Cash Flow conversion or if there's a higher level of Free Cash Flow conversion we should anchor to as a target? Maybe you could talk about that.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you for the question, Steve. As we think about the Free Cash Flow and net income conversion into Free Cash Flow, important to realize that the dividend payout of the joint ventures that we have is not 100% and so that is a little bit of a factor as you consider the conversion. The other one I would tell you is we're going to have a slight uptick in CapEx, particularly as we need to invest in places like India. I mean you look at the volume over the last five years in India, it has been stellar and we are very happy. But we are at the point where we need to put down a little bit more capacity. Same goes for Latin America and Oreo and obviously we integrate platforms like Ricolino, etc.\nThe other one that will come into play in terms of capital expenses for 2024 is SAP HANA. So I think that's another element you have to consider. I think, look, the number I would like you to focus on is what we deliver in 2020, which net of the taxes we paid for coffee is around about $4 billion, and so there might be some one-time payment coming our way, and so we need to make sure that we have enough headroom. But I want to reassure you that in terms of Free Cash Flow we are very happy. We have best-in-class, I believe, cash conversion cycle. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lowering overdue across the board, and inventories are coming down, so we feel good about the cash flow generation of the company.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nVery good, very good. Thank you for that. And you know, it sounds like you're going to talk a little bit more about this at CAGNY. But you know, to the extent you can talk about it now, just the prospects for.\nYou know, volume recovery and organic growth acceleration in North America.\nI guess how quickly do you think that is likely to manifest in 2024? Is that going to be a slower build or do you think we should expect some results sooner? You know, as you leverage some of the commercial investments that it sounds like you made in the fourth quarter?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYes, I think you said it right at the end there in the Q4. If you think about it.\nOn one hand, we had a good year and we were coming with a price increase, which by the way has been agreed in the US in the beginning of the year. So no need to push in volumes from our side. Then we had the Clif system integration changeover. And so we needed to bring our inventory down and manage it very tightly. And then we talked about the Give and Go holiday kit that we stopped selling because the margins were not interesting for us. So if I exclude those and.\nLook at the rest of the business, the volume mix performance in Q4 was in fact quite good. So we're expecting a good volume mix performance right away in Q1 of next year. It is really a one-off situation in Q4. So we don't really necessarily feel like there is a slowdown in North America. It's not going to be massive volume growth, but it's going to be positive volume growth in the beginning of the year. So that's where we are. It's not going to be a slow buildup. We will continue where we are without the exceptionals that we had in Q4.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, very good. Thanks, Dirk. I'll pass it on.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Alexia Howard, Bernstein.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGood evening, everyone.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nHi, Alexia.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nHi.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. So, two questions. First of all on innovation, I'm just wondering if you can give us a quick status update on whether the pace of innovation is likely to pick up going forward. It feels like with the pandemic and the supply chain disruption, it's been very hard to do innovation over the last several years. Do you anticipate a pickup going forward, and then I have a follow up?\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International",
    "content2": "Yes, we are going through a bit of a change in the way we look at innovation. If you think about our business around the world, we have quite a rhythm of small innovation. New flavors, new sizes of packs as we do PPA and RGM. But that leads to hundreds of small projects which do drive our business. But we are gradually.\nEliminating probably close to half of those small projects because in fact, over time they don't have that much of an impact on the business. Since overall our business is doing well, we can afford to do so and we are shifting our focus to bigger innovation projects. And so the ones that I would mention is first of all making healthier versions of our.\nMainstream products. So I'm referring to, for instance, what you've seen so far, an Oreo Gluten Free or Oreo Zero Sugar in China, Gluten Free in the US doing quite well. And you can expect that we will continue to expand those efforts across other brands. Then we are entering quite significantly in cakes and pastries. And there you can expect us to push quite hard. And so you could see the Oreo Cakesters or the Oreo Airy Cake in China. And these are all significant innovations that have the potential of tens of millions of dollars of net revenue per country. We're pushing hard on premium chocolate, so we launched, for instance, the Toblerone Provence.\nOr we have done some big innovations on our core chocolate tablets. So these are bigger innovations that require more work, higher potential, but we are reshifting our efforts towards those. So I don't know if I would call it what you were asking, Alexia. Do we see pick up the pace of innovation? I think the impact of innovation on our growth will increase in the coming years, but it's not driven by more innovation, it's driven by better innovation. I would say.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nVery helpful.\nAnd then, could I just follow up finally? Do you have any observations about the state of the American consumer? I think we've heard from other companies that there's been down trading, there's vulnerability, there's channel shifting. I'm just wondering if any of whether some of the challenges that you're seeing in North America are being driven by this consumer dynamic.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nYeah, everything you're saying is true. Let me explain it a little bit. I would say the consumer as it relates from a behavior standpoint, as in the fourth quarter, show the biggest shifts. And I can explain a little bit the shift that we've seen, but from a mindset perspective, from a confidence perspective in North America, probably the best in the last two and a half years. So what they're doing is still reflecting sort of the tension they're under, but they are expecting the economy to improve and that better times are ahead for them. So what are they doing?\nWe see a little bit more of an elasticity effect. The way they react to that is they're waiting more. We see particularly light buyers waiting for promotion. Not buying with the same frequency, but buying more. When it's on promotion, we see them downsizing, going to smaller formats, and buying more of those.\nWe see shift in channels. They go to club channels, e-commerce channels that. That's the one we see winning. And then we have a number of sort of mechanical effects that we're seeing, particularly the SNAP reduction in the US, and so we see less disposable income for a certain group of consumers. But overall, I would say we expect that that gradually will improve because of that mindset change that I was saying. So the overall volume expectations as the year goes by in the US, we're expecting to accelerate and to get better. That's a little bit our view on the US consumer at the moment.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I'll hand it back to you.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman and CEO, Mondel?z International\n\nAll right. Thank you. Well, thank you. I think that was the last question. As we said, we feel very good about 2023. It was a great year for us. We are entering 2024 with good momentum. I think we're prepared for everything that we are seeing ahead of it. And as I said, there is some issues that we have to look at. But despite all that and including those effects into our forecast for the year, we think that we're going to have a strong year. We'll see how the client disruption goes in Europe. So we have to wait a little bit to see how the Q1 goes by. But overall, we think we will have a year on the higher side of our algorithm at this stage that we can forecast.\nAgain, thank you, and happy to answer any other questions that you would have through our IR department.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nCFO, Mondel?z International\n\nThank you everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.\n[Background Music]"

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.\nYou can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. Our strong third quarter results and our prospects for the future confirm that we are positioned for high-quality, sustainable growth. We remain confident in the durability of our categories, the strength of our iconic brands and the consistency of our execution. We delivered strong profitable volume growth with a healthy share performance. All our geographic regions grew double digits in both revenue and profitability.\nTo manage cost inflation and enable robust reinvestments, we continue to leverage our RGM capabilities. RGM is an area where we believe there is significant room to do more over the next several years. We continue to reshape our portfolio to focus on our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks with the successful divestiture of our developed market gum business, generating additional reinvestment opportunities.\nOur strong year-to-date performance, the continued strength of our categories and our ongoing focus on strong commercial plans and execution provide the confidence to again raise both our organic net revenue outlook to 14% to 15% and adjusted EPS growth outlook to approximately 16%.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that in the third quarter, we delivered both top and bottom line strength, enabling us to continue substantial reinvestment in our brands. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 15.7% for the quarter. Year-to-date revenue is up 17%, nearly $4 billion ahead of last year. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 22.3% for the quarter. Again, we are ahead of last year's pace with 20% growth year-to-date, up $1.7 billion.\nThe strong performance enables us to reinvest in our brands and capabilities to drive attractive growth in future periods. Our A&C investment is up 28.5% for the quarter and 21.5% for the year, which demonstrates our commitment to continue to build the strength of our brands. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth, up 24.5% for the quarter and close to $900 million for the year.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, our third quarter growth was driven by strong volume/mix, up nearly 4 points. We are especially pleased that our European pricing actions, which were implemented earlier this year, are successfully behind us. We view this quarter strong volume/mix performance as evidence that we are taking the right actions to continue delivering sustainable growth and share gains.\nConsumers continue to choose our trusted and beloved brands, despite significant pricing due to ongoing inflation. More broadly, we view our strong performance in the third quarter as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to pay off. Since the launch of our growth plan in 2018, we have consistently delivered gross profit dollar growth, which allowed for a virtuous cycle of yearly increasing high-return investments. We remain confident that this strategy will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth.\nTurning to Slide 7. We continue to see evidence that consumer demand for our snacking categories remains resilient and that consumers continue to prefer our widely loved brands over private label alternatives. In North America, the biscuit category is experiencing some softness in scanner data, most notably among lower-income families. However, I would note that these families are increasing their purchases in the non-measured club store channel.\nOur total U.S. biscuits volume was up more than 3% in Q3, showcasing the continued strength of our brands and investments in both measured and non-measured channels. We are seeing particularly strong growth in unmeasured channels like club stores, e-commerce and food service. Meanwhile, in Europe, consumer confidence is improving with a significant step-up versus 2022 and remains broadly stable throughout Q3. We're seeing positive volume growth in biscuits and chocolates, which has accelerated over the last 3 months and is outpacing broader food, driven by solid elasticities and lapping of 2022 disruptions.\nIn Q3, our European chocolate and biscuit business delivered solid volume growth of 2.6%, which again shows the resilience of our categories and the strength of our brands. In emerging markets, consumer confidence remains strong. We continue to see resilient underlying demand and lower price sensitivity than in developed markets. During Q3, we delivered strong growth in terms of both volume and value at 4% and 24%, respectively. And we are confident that we have strong opportunities to continue to drive expanded distribution and creating new snacking occasions.\nOn Slide 8, you can see a few examples of our growth acceleration strategy in action. We continue to invest in our brands and connect closely with consumers to stay in line with changing consumer tastes and snacking occasions. We are also driving growth in a broader range of channels while accelerating our focus on premium segments and harnessing the power of recent acquisitions to advance geographic expansion.\nFor example, Oreo continues to grow its strong position as the world's favorite cookie, and its share performance here in North America has grown nicely. Our recent partnership with Super Mario Brothers executed both online and in-store is just one example of the many creative campaigns that leverage personalization and local relevance to reinforce the brand's playfield persona.\nAlong with continuous reinvestment in our brands, we are also investing in growth channels. For example, our belVita business is up nearly a full share point in the U.S. club channel, driven by growing shopper interest in convenience, tasty and better-for-you options for morning snacking on the go. Sold in individual portion packs and delivering more than 14 grams of whole grains per serving, belVita offers a great solution for consumers who are too busy to eat a traditional breakfast.\nWe're continuing to grow this business with a new customized and digitally targeted social and digital media campaign celebrating the ritual of belVita and coffee in the morning. Another important element of our growth strategy is investing in the fast-growing premium chocolate space. We have relaunched Toblerone with a robust campaign inspired by luxury freshen brand positioning We're supporting this launch with a strengthened brand persona, Never Square and substantial investments in A&C.\nBringing this dual concept to life, our new called Toblerone Truffles recently debuted in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Australia as well as airport duty-free stores in key markets. They will expand to additional markets next year. Finally, we continue driving geographic expansion of our recently acquired brands. For example, Ricolino headquartered in Mexico is now the #1 Hispanic confectioning brand in the United States, growing well and in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's zoom in closer on the snack bar business to highlight the strong progress. We're excited about the opportunities in this space, and we believe there is significant runway ahead, led by the strong and growing brands of Clif Bar, Grenade and Perfect Snacks. We expect our snack bar business to exceed $1.2 billion net revenue this year.\nLet's start with Clif, where we are excited about our current results and the long-term opportunity to broaden distribution, expand into new formats and increase our geographical reach. Year-to-date, Clif is up double digit in top line growth. And within that, the Clif Kid Zbar has been a particular standout. Zbar is a delicious organic non-GMO soft-baked, whole grain energy snack for kids with 0 trans fat or artificial flavors. Zbar is growing at twice the rate of the total bars category with consumption dollar growth up 19% versus last year.\nGrenade also continues to exceed our expectations. Grenade is performing very well in the sports nutrition space with signature bars that are high in protein and low in sugar. Since our acquisition a bit more than 2 years ago, we have doubled the business, thanks to strong core growth in the U.K. and distribution expansion in Ireland, Nordics and the Benelux.\nPerfect Snacks also is experiencing continued double-digit value growth, strengthening its position as the #1 refrigerated protein bar in the United States. We have a great portfolio and strong conviction in the growth potential of our snack bar business, and we will continue investing to drive leadership in the segment.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'd like to take a moment to share progress on an important element of our sustainability strategy. Just 2 years after joining the science-based targets initiative, net zero carbon ambition, we have submitted a time-bound plan laying out how we aim to achieve our target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain by 2050. To reach this critical milestone, we have completed a detailed process of rebaselining providing documentation of our carbon accounting and aligning to new standards.\nPutting this plan into action in the near term, we are making solid progress towards our 2025 goal of reducing end-to-end carbon emissions by 10%. We are working hard to transform our business operations and supply chains. Over the past 2 years, we have scaled regenerative agriculture practices across our signature sourcing programs for coco and wheat, achieved renewable energy at manufacturing sites across every region and reduced CO2 emissions through plant and logistical efficiencies.\nWe continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale, including through reducing our climate impact, is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for our stakeholders. We encourage you to read our Snacking Made Right report for additional details and context on our broader sustainability goals and progress. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q3 was strong all across our business, with high-quality top and bottom line growth, healthy volume mix, record profit dollar increases and substantial brand reinvestment. We delivered double-digit organic revenue of 15.7% with growth across each region, underpinned by volume mix of almost 4% as well as by some pricing of around 12%. Our business is proving to be resilient, both in emerging markets, which grew 19%, with strong performance virtually everywhere, and in developed markets, which grew more than 13% with balanced trends from both North America and Europe.\nTurning to portfolio performance on Slide 13. Our chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy businesses, all posted double-digit increases in Q3. Biscuit increased plus 12.4%. Oreo Lup biscuit 7Days and delivered double-digit growth and robust volumes. Chocolate grew plus 14.9%, with double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone and Lacta, all posted double-digit increases. Gum and candy grew more than 30%, with particular strength coming from emerging markets.\nNow let's review market and share performance on Slide 14. We held or gained share in 65% of our revenue base, driven by brand-building investments as well as solid North America supply chain performance and strong sales execution, particularly in emerging markets. Moving to regional performance on Slide 15. As far as Q3 goals, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in every single region, with a significant contribution from healthy volume/mix growth, including Europe, which has rebounded after lending pricing this summer and is now in a much stronger position.\nThis robust growth and volume performance translated into operating leverage across the business. Notwithstanding material marketing investment, profit growth delivery has been very strong in all regions. Europe grew plus 15.4%, with nearly 30% OI growth that was driven by pricing and volume/mix. Top line strength was broad-based with the U.K., Germany and France, among those posted strong results. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Oreo, 7Days and Grenade were among brands with double-digit growth. European elasticities remained stable in both chocolate and biscuits.\nNorth America grew plus 11.4%, with OI dollar growth of more than 24%, driven by higher pricing and volume/mix growth of 4.6%. Oreo, Clif, Tate's and and Patch, all grew double digits, while and Ritz and belVita posted high single-digit increases in the quarter. Profitability in the base business remained strong, while acquired businesses, such as Clif and Tate's, posted strong double-digit profit dollar growth. This is an important proof point showing how accretive our M&A agenda can be.\nClif profitability continues to improve. And as I said last quarter, we still have some synergies opportunities as we have now integrated the platform into SAP. AMEA grew plus 11.9%, with volume/mix growth of more than 3%. OI dollars increased plus 18.1%. India and Australia grew double digits, while China increased high single digits in the quarter. Latin America grew more than 35% with OI dollar growth of nearly plus 57%.\nLA top line grew more than 16%, ex Argentina. Mexico to Western Andean countries and Brazil, once again delivered great results. Ricolino grew high single digits and remains on track in terms of integration work. Moving to Page 16. We delivered nearly $650 million in gross profit dollar growth or more than 22%, driven by top line growth, volume leverage and productivity. Year-to-date, GP dollar growth is now more than $1.7 billion. This provides ample funding to reinvest for future growth and flow to the net earnings line.\nOI dollar growth was more than $300 million for the quarter or up more than 24% versus last year, driven by solid cost discipline, effective pricing and volume leverage. Year-to-date, OI dollars have grown $880 million or almost 24%. EPS on Slide 17. Year-to-date, EPS grew more than 18% in constant currency or more than 13% reported dollars, driven primarily by strong operating gains.\nTurning to Slide 18. Free cash flow is $2.4 billion year-to-date, which represents an increase of $0.5 billion year-over-year. Year-to-date, capital return is $2.2 billion. Moving to our outlook on Page 20. Given the strength of our Q3 and year-to-date performance, strong volume/mix momentum across our brands and overall demand resilience, we are now raising our full year outlook for both revenue and EPS.\nWe now expect top line growth of 14% to 15% versus our original outlook of 5% to 7% and most recent outlook of 12% plus. EPS growth is also expected to be approximately 16% versus our prior outlook of 12% plus and original outlook of high single digit. In terms of the assumptions, no change to our double-digit inflation. We also expect interest expenses of approximately $325 million for the year. Leverage is expected to be in the mid- to upper 2s range by year-end.\nWith respect to currency, we now expect $0.15 of EPS headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.11 in our prior outlook, of which $0.12 have been materialized already in the year-to-date. On the gum divestiture that became effective as of the beginning of October, this current outlook reflects the loss of the business for the entirety of Q4. We are not providing yet restated financials as teams are working through the definition of the impact and importantly, the removal of stranded costs.\nWhile we will provide a full update in the next earnings cycle, we do not expect any material EPS dilution as we will remove majority of stranded costs in '24. The outlook revision reflects our increased confidence in the year, ongoing resilience of consumer consumption in our categories, relatively benign elasticities, continued brand reinvestments and completion of pricing in Europe and emerging markets.\nThere is a lot of volatility around the world, and it is important to note that this current outlook does not reflect a material deterioration of the geopolitical environment and ForEx rounding some areas of the business. Finally, a word on share repurchases. Now that we have received the proceeds of our sales upcome, our balance sheet is the strongest it has ever been, with long tenure debt at very compelling interest rates relative to the current cost environment.\nWe decided to post buybacks in Q3 and were in our traditional peers late in the quarter and the month leading up to earnings. However, we expect to consider buybacks for the remainder of the year and into next, given the current stock price versus our view of intrinsic value and long-term potential of our company. We realize we have underspent versus our original outlook of $2 billion for the year and that provides the opportunity to take advantage of current low stock price levels.\nAdditionally, we could pull forward from our '24 share repurchases if an appropriate opportunity presented itself. We will be flexible and opportunistic in our timing, depending on the various factors. We believe this is the right thing to do, given the current context. Importantly, this does not represent a change in our ability to pursue our well-defined capital allocation strategies as our priorities remain the same in terms of reinvesting in the business and in selected strategically and financially attractive bolt-on M&As as well as strong dividend growth. With that, let's open the line for questions.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nAs we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.\nToday, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong broad-based top line growth during the first half of the year. Our strong performance was driven by effective pricing, combined with healthy volume growth in 3 of our 4 regions. Europe was a lone exception due to expected disruption driven by retailer negotiations. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy, and we see robust momentum and solid consumer confidence across geographies and categories. We successfully implemented our planned price increases in Europe, closing our customer negotiations in line with expectations. With this behind us, we feel good about the remainder of the year in Europe.\nWe also feel good about continued consumer confidence. We continue to drive robust demand in our core categories across the vast majority of our businesses, resulting in both value and volume growth. Our strong profit dollar growth was driven by cost discipline and pricing to offset cost inflation. We continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and portfolio reshaping initiatives to accelerate and compound growth. And we remain confident that our proven strategy delivered by our world-class team positions us well to deliver another strong year.\nBased on the strength of our first half performance and our latest view across businesses, we are raising our full year organic net revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook to 12% plus.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that the first half of 2023 showed continued momentum across our entire business. We delivered first half organic net revenue growth of $2.7 billion, up nearly 18% versus prior year, and significantly ahead of our already strong 12% in full year 2022. This includes a 15.8% growth for the quarter. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of more than $1 billion. Again, we are well ahead of last year's pace with 18.9% growth. We're proud of our team's continued focus and agility, which enable us to continue investing to drive further growth acceleration. Our A&C investment is increasing 18% in the first half of the year. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth of close to $600 million, up 23% and again, well ahead of last year's pace.\nOn Slide 6, you can see a few examples of our brand acceleration strategy in action. Our continued investments in creative assets, personalization at scale and innovation, combined with strong in-store execution, are resulting in continued sales growth and brand loyalty increases in our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and big snacks. For example, in China, we launched Oreo Airy Cake in March. Driven by the strength of the Oreo name as the world's favorite cookie, this new packaged cake already has achieved a 3.5% market share and 80% of the velocity of its leading competitor in large stores. And China is one of our most important emerging markets. This is just one example of numerous innovations to expand our key brands into adjacent spaces and formats.\nWe're also continuing to renovate our recipes to stay a step ahead of changing consumer and customer tastes. For instance, we recently launched our first under-100 calories Cadbury treat for adults. This is a great example of our commitment to help consumers snack mindfully. We are offering a broader range of portion-controlled packs and products, but also our portion control education campaigns both digitally and on pack.\nIn the baked snacks segment, we continue to accelerate both top and bottom line performance in Clif Bar. We remain focused on improving service levels and supply chain efficiencies, while further advancing productivity and effectiveness in our media spend and continuing to strengthen brand equity.\nWe're also continuing to introduce new culturally relevant flavors to strengthen consumer loyalty for our local jewel brands. For example, Lacta has been a leader in Brazilian chocolate for over 110 years. Following the successful launch of Lacta tablets filled with Oreo, we recently rolled out 2 new line extensions filled with additional Lacta products that Brazilians already know and love. This all-new [indiscernible] made with chocolate and cashew nut filling as well as Ouro Branco candies made with wafers filled with chocolate cream and covered in white chocolate.\nThese are just a few examples of the innovative ways our teams are driving growth in our iconic chocolate, biscuits and baked snack franchises, continuously investing in new formats, pack sizes and flavor combinations that drive incrementality and encourage consumers to experience our brands in new ways.\nWithin the baked snacks segment, we're especially excited about our strong performance in the rapidly growing cakes and pastry space. Let's take a closer look on Slide 7.\nEarlier, I mentioned the Oreo Airy Cake in China as a great example of our brand acceleration efforts in emerging markets. Similarly, in developed markets, we're making solid progress in expanding our successful cookie and chocolate franchises into chocobakery, cakes and pastries. For instance, in the United States, Oreo Cakesters are continuing to perform well. Since the recent launch of this fan favorite, it already has earned a 3.7% share of packaged snack cakes.\nGive & Go is another solid success story in our North America baked snacks lineup, where we're continuing to drive distribution and innovation. Share is up 0.5 point year-to-date, driven by solid pricing execution, expansion into adjacencies such as mini doughnuts and strong category demand.\nMeantime, in Europe, 7Days continues to advance its position as the #1 packaged croissant, and we have exciting plans to continue to grow its footprint beyond Europe, including recent test-and-learn trials in a number of emerging markets.\nTurning to Slide 8. We continue to invest in digital commerce and revenue growth management tools and capabilities to support our brands while strengthening our partnerships with leading customers. I'm pleased to share that we have achieved the #1 market share position in digital commerce in our top 5 markets of the United States, China, United Kingdom, France and Brazil, while over-delivering in up-and-coming emerging markets such as India, Philippines, Brazil, Mexico and Poland, which are up 40% year-to-date.\nWe continue accelerating eB2B capabilities to expand distribution and strengthen our partnerships with key customers. Additionally, our increased investments in elevating RGM strategies and actions are driving strong value realization, helping to offset inflationary pressures. We have appointed dedicated RGM leadership and teams in all key markets, supported with new proprietary data and analytics assessments, digital tools and a comprehensive training program. We are confident that these ongoing investments will deliver sustainable improvements in growth, efficiency and ultimately, margin.\nAlong with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress in advancing our environmental, social and governance strategy. In May, we published our Annual Snacking Made Right report, reinforcing our 2025 goals and documenting our latest performance in priority areas. These include sourcing key ingredients more sustainably, reducing carbon emissions and increasing recyclable packaging.\nWe are also improving performance in social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion, both internally and in partnership with our suppliers as well as helping consumers snack more mindfully through improved portion education and increased focus on single portion packs.\nWe continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale across these important areas is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for all our stakeholders. We encourage you to read our Snacking Made Right report for more details and context on our progress.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q2 marked another strong quarter for our business. Double-digit organic net revenue growth across each region, sound pricing execution, strong profit dollar growth and significant reinvestment enabled us to continue driving sustainable value creation.\nRevenue grew plus 15.8% with strong volume/mix growth in North America, Latin America and EMEA. Overall, volume/mix was flat for the quarter despite the expected customer disruption in Europe. Recall, last year's Q2 total company volume/mix was plus 5%, making this performance even more impressive.\nEmerging markets grew more than 23% with strong performance across significant numbers of markets, while developed markets grew 11% with balanced trends from both North America and Europe and despite customer disruption.\nTurning to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy businesses all posted another quarter of double-digit increases in Q2. Biscuits increased plus 13.9%. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!. Give & Go, TAC and Club Social all delivered double-digit growth. Clif, though not inorganic, also posted strong growth. Chocolate grew plus 13.7%, with strength in both developed and emerging markets. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta, Toblerone all delivered double-digit increases. We are very pleased with the performance of our core categories of chocolate and biscuits, which, albeit impacted in the quarter by customer disruption, are on a solid trajectory. For both, we expect good volume momentum as we move forward in the year now that negotiations in Europe are behind us. Gum and candy grew more than 30%, with strength across our business units, especially in emerging markets.\nNow let's review market and share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 70% of our revenue base. The U.S. continues to make service level improvements and ended Q2 with good on-shelf availability and inventory levels.\nMoving to Page 14. We delivered more than $540 million in gross profit growth or 20% in Q2, driven by top line productivity and cost discipline. This also resulted in year-over-year gross margin expansion in all regions except Europe, which was impacted by expected customer disruption. Now that pricing is implemented, we expect improvements in Europe, too. This growth provides significant fuel to invest behind our brands as well as significant earnings flow-through.\nMoving to regional performance on Slide 15. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all regions, while also delivering volume/mix increases in all regions but Europe that got impacted by pricing-related disruption. This growth translated into operating leverage and OI dollar growth across the board. Europe grew plus 13.1% with double-digit OI growth. Importantly, pricing has now been [ lending ], and we expect that this will lead to a better second half volume and margin performance.\nOverall, the consumer remains resilient with elasticities holding up relatively well in chocolate and biscuit, while we saw some incremental elasticity in part of our Cheese and Grocery business.\nNorth America grew plus 12.4%, with OI dollar growth of more than 29%, driven by higher pricing, volume/mix of 2% and strength from both our base biscuits business and our ventures, such as Give & Go, Perfect Snacks and Tate's. Tate's also posted robust growth and delivered another operating margin increase of double-digit in percentage points in Q2 versus last year. Now profitability is approaching the level of total North America, but we still have to generate material synergies, both on revenue and cost line. So Clif is a business that is growing, has now some margins and still with meaningful synergy potential.\nEMEA grew 13.2%, with solid volume/mix growth of more than 3%. OI dollars increased plus 4.2%. India, China, Southeast Asia all posted strong top line growth for the quarter. Latin America grew more than 37% with OI dollar growth of nearly 65%. Mexico, [ Western India ] countries and Brazil all turned in robust quarters. Ricolino remains on track in terms of integration, and we expect to begin capturing more benefits towards the end of the year.\nNext to EPS on Slide 16. In the quarter, EPS grew plus 21.5% in constant currency or nearly 17% reported dollars.\nTurning to Slide 17. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion in the first half with $1.7 billion in return of capital to shareholders. We also announced today an increase in our dividend of plus 10%, marking a double-digit increase in 8 of the last 9 years of the history of Mondelez.\nTurning to our outlook on Page 19. Given the strength of our Q2 and first half performance, the successful conclusion of our negotiations in Europe, the strong volume momentum of our brands, we are raising our full year outlook for both revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We now expect top line growth of 12% plus, versus our original outlook of 5% to 7%, and most recent outlook of 10% plus. EPS growth is also expected to be 12% plus versus our prior outlook of 10% plus and the original outlook of high single digits.\nNote, our free cash flow outlook remains unchanged at $3.3 billion, given $400 million in cash taxes related to the sell-down and exit of our KDP position.\nIn terms of key assumptions, we continue to expect a double-digit inflation increase for '23 driven by elevated cost in packaging, ingredients, labor and lapping favorable commodity hedges in 2022.\nWith respect to interest expense, we now expect $380 million for the year, given recent coffee asset monetization and term loan reductions. We also expect to end the year around mid-2s in terms of leverage based on current conditions.\nAs a reminder, given the liquidation of our KDP position in middle of July, there will be no dividend income recorded in half 2. We now expect $0.11 of EPS of headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.09 in our prior outlook. The outlook revision reflects our increased confidence in the year, ongoing resilience of consumer consumptions in our categories, relatively benign elasticities, continued brand reinvestment and completion of pricing in Europe as well as health of our emerging markets. This current outlook does not consider a material deterioration of geopolitical environment surrounding some areas of our business.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

I'm pleased to share that we are off to a record start in 2023 and with very strong double-digit top line growth in the first quarter, driven by effective pricing and ongoing volume growth. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy, and we see robust momentum across geographies and categories. We delivered strong performance in both emerging and developed markets, and we successfully implemented circa 80% of our price increases in Europe. Our robust profit dollar growth was driven by volume leverage, cost discipline and pricing to offset cost inflation.\nOur strategic decision to focus our portfolio on the attractive categories of chocolate, biscuits and big snacks continues to bear fruit with consumers gravitating to those categories. We continue to invest in our brands, in our capabilities and our portfolio-reshaping initiatives to accelerate and compound growth on both the top and bottom lines. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued investments and especially our talented people position us well to deliver another strong year. Based on the strength of these Q1 results and our latest view across businesses, we are raising our revenue and adjusted earnings outlook to 10% plus for the year.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that the first quarter showed continued momentum across our entire business. Volume mix for the quarter was more than 3 percentage points, on pace with recent performance, demonstrating the continued strength and resiliency of our beloved brands in categories even in an inflationary environment. We delivered organic net revenue growth of $1.5 billion versus prior year. At 19.4% growth, we delivered our best quarter ever, significantly ahead of our already strong 12% in full year 2022. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $0.5 billion. Again, we are well ahead of last year's pace with 18.2% growth.\nWe're proud of our team's continued focus and agility, which enable us to continue investing to drive further growth acceleration with an A&C increase of 19% for the quarter. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth of close to $300 million, up nearly 21% and again, well ahead of last year's pace. We remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, fueling local-first commercial execution, increasing investment in our iconic brands empowered by winning culture will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth.\nOn Slide 6, a few examples of our brand strategy in action. We continue to invest in our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and big snacks with strong creative assets, digital personalization at scale, new product launches and great in-store execution. All this continues to strengthen our already strong brand loyalty. It is clear that we're playing in the right categories with attractive growth in volume and dollars, combined with solid profitability characteristics. There is also significant headroom in both penetration and per capita consumption in developed and developing markets.\nWe continue to expand the breadth and reach of our chocolate leadership in the attractive and growing Latin America region. For example, we recently launched our Chocolate brand, Milka, into Colombia. Additionally, we launched 2 Milka ice cream products in Argentina in association with Froneri. We're excited about these opportunities to explore a new segment and reach more consumers while expanding one of our most iconic brands into a new consumption occasion.\nWe hit another milestone in bite biscuits category. As Chips Ahoy!, a $1 billion brand, celebrates its 60th birthday, our fifth largest brand globally, Chips Ahoy! has delivered almost double-digit revenue growth annually since 2018, yielding positive results from our increased A&C spend during that time period. The brand's current key markets are the United States and China where the business is on a $200 million run rate. But Chips Ahoy! also has a sizable presence in Canada, Latin America and Southeast Asia. We have exciting plans to further expand this franchise as we grow our leadership in both core biscuits and new shopper bakery innovations around the world.\nOreo continues to grow -- to show, sorry, strong momentum across markets as consumers continue to demonstrate that this iconic brand is truly the world's favorite cookie. Give & Go is a success story in our big snacks line. It grew strong double digits in Q1, driven by solid pricing execution, expansion into adjacencies such as mini donuts and strong category demand. These are just a few examples of our team's ongoing focus on delivering our growth and acceleration strategy as we continue to reinvest in and drive our very powerful brands.\nNow let's take a look at our chocolate strategy on Slide 7. Tablets remain the centerpiece of our chocolate franchise. Mondelez accounts for more than 1/3 of this segment, more than 3x the size of the #2 player, and we continue to lead this segment year after year. 2022 is -- sorry, 2023 is off to a very strong start aided by the recent launch of our renovated Milka formulation, the creamiest, most tender Milka ever, combined with some strong local jewels. Our tablet business is up nearly 0.5 point in market share with particularly strong growth in Australia, Canada, Germany and Brazil.\nWe're also performing well in the incremental segments of seasonal and gifting chocolate products. We delivered a record sell-in for the Easter season across markets, with Milka celebrating its first ever Easter in Chile. Our Cadbury team executed another successful virtual Easter hand, reaching more than 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, Ireland and South Africa, making our seasonal products even more iconic.\nWe also are growing in the premium chocolate space. For example, Toblerone, volume is up more than 15% in Q1, fueled by its relaunch with updated on-trend positioning. We are further strengthening the Toblerone portfolio with additional offerings, including per lean and personalized gifting.\nSwitching to Slide 8. Solid execution against our integration playbook is delivering a strong start to the year for our recently acquired businesses. We are pleased that Clif in Q1 posted double-digit revenue growth and grew profitability by more than 1,000 basis points. We're making strong operational improvements focusing on enhancing service levels and improving supply chain efficiencies, and we successfully implemented 2 rounds of pricing. Additionally, we recently announced a consolidation of creative and advertising agencies under a single partner, which will accelerate productivity in our media spend while continuing to strengthen brand equity and loyalty. Similarly, our Ricolino business continues to demonstrate strong momentum in the fast-growing and strategically important Mexican market, and we are making solid progress on integration.\nAlong with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress in our sustainability strategy. We firmly believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for all of our stakeholders. As you can see on Slide 9, this quarter, we announced the next chapter of Harmony, our European wheat sustainability program. With regenerative agriculture at its heart, this next chapter aims to mitigate climate change and reverse biodiversity losses while investing in research seeking to demonstrate that more sustainable wheat is also better quality meat.\nCreated as the first program of its kind in 2008 with just a handful of farmers, the Harmony program now collaborates with more than 1,300 farmers across 7 European countries. Our enhanced program will support these farmers in implementing a stronger chapter of more sustainable farming practices such as further diversifying crop rotation, protecting pollinators and other wildlife and reducing pesticide use. Our goal is to grow 100% of the wheat volume needed for our European biscuits production under our expanded Harmony regenerative chapter by 2030.\nThis is just one example of the way that we are fully integrating our sustainability agenda within our day-to-day business operations and growth strategy. I'm proud of Team Mondelez's continued progress in helping to make positive impact on critical environmental and social issues while creating value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q1 was a great start to the year. Broad-based volume, pricing, profit dollar growth, brand investment, earnings and free cash flow all indicates that our strategy is sound and our focus on execution in paying off. Our model is working well, while meaningful opportunities still exist to further drive our long-term ambitions.\nFor the quarter, revenue growth was plus 19.4% with more than 2 points from volume mix. Emerging markets grew more than 25% with strong performance across the overwhelming majority of countries. 4.5 points of this growth were attributable to volume mix. Developed markets grew 15.8% in Q1 with across-the-board strength and more than 2 points of growth coming from volume mix. To note, the customer disruption in Europe was more benign than we anticipated.\nTurning to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Chocolate biscuits, gum and candy all posted robust double-digit increases in Q1. Biscuits grew plus 16.9%, with positive volume mix despite substantial price increases. Oreo, Reese, Chips Ahoy!, Give & Go and Club Social were among brands that delivered double-digit growth, albeit not contributing to organic growth. Clif posted good growth versus last year, too. Chocolate grew more than 18% with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume was positive despite some customer disruptions in Europe, albeit lower than anticipated. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka Lata and Toblerone all delivered robust growth, and we had a record Easter selling that based on preliminary data, also resulted in record high sellout. Gum & Candy grew 35%, with robust growth across all of our key markets.\nNow let's review market share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 60% of our revenue base, which includes 10 points of headwinds coming from EU customer disruption. The U.S. continues to make service level improvements ending Q1 with good on-shelf availability and case fill rates, resulting in share being flat to last year. Given stabilization of the supply chain, we feel confident that share will continue to improve during the year in the U.S.\nTurning to Page 14. We delivered strong double-digit to high dollar growth driven by a gross profit increase of more than $540 million. These results enable us to continue to significantly fund our business for future growth while also providing strong earnings and cash flow.\nMoving to regional results on Slide 15. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and posted volume mix increases in all regions. This growth, fueled by pricing and volume leverage, drove robust OI dollar growth across all regions.\nEurope grew plus 18.9% with high single-digit to high growth. We have made progress in lending expected pricing increases with circa 80% of our customers, and we lowered disruption than we anticipated. We are still planning for some disruption in Q2, which has been factored into our revised outlook as the remaining 20% of our customer base is not on yet. Consumers' confidence has stabilized in much of the region with many key countries trending back to spring 2022 levels. Elasticities of biscuits and chocolate are overall less negative than we anticipated, including in the U.K., where the impact of HFSS is less material than what we had forecasted. Overall, rather than cutting back significantly on size of their basket, consumers are shopping around to find attractive deals and trading up and down in terms of tax sizes based on their specific needs and consumer occasions. They remain loyal to branded products, particularly in chocolate. Having said that, our focus is now on lending the remaining part of the price increases.\nNorth America grew plus 17.3% with OI dollar growth of more than 40% driven by higher pricing, solid volume mix and strength from our ventures, particularly Clif. We are reassured by the quality of the P&L in the region and by the fact that volume is holding up well while we still have opportunity of returning market share to steady growth.\nEMEA grew plus 13.8% with strong volume mix of nearly 6%. OI dollars increased plus 15.6%. India continues to be a key driver of success in the region, and we also have ambitious plans in China that will benefit from a broader reopening after COVID.\nLatin America grew plus 39% with a high dollar growth of more than 47%. We are very pleased with the performance in the region with clear progress made over the last couple of years in terms of execution and ability to drive key brands like Oreo [ new heights ]. Ricolino zone is off to a strong start, but we have not yet realized the benefit of the full integration that will happen towards the end of the year.\nNext to EPS on Slide 16. EPS grew plus 17.3% in constant currency or nearly plus 10% at reported dollars driven primarily by strong operating gains.\nTurning to Slide 17. We generated free cash flow of $900 million in Q1, returning $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nA few words on our recent KDP sell-down on Page 19. This investment has been highly successful, demonstrating our disciplined and flexible approach to managing our investments and assets over time. Including dividends received and the market value of our remaining stake, this investment has generated a return of approximately 3.3x, our initial investment over a 7-year period. We received approximately $1 billion in net proceeds from the most recent sale, and our remaining stake is now 3.2%. From an accounting perspective, we will no longer account for this under the equity method but rather recognizing dividends as the only income as of the dividend record date. We will adjust out mark-to-market quarterly remeasurements of the stake, in line with the gains that we have been obtained after each sell-down. These adjustments will be recorded in a new P&L line item, which will be below interest expenses.\nIn terms of net EPS impact for 2023, purely on the basis of the different accounting treatment, we expect a headwind of approximately $0.03. I want to reiterate that this is merely accounting-driven and not changing the essence of the investment itself. The gain on this sale, which is approximately $0.5 billion, will run through the same account that we have used for past year sales.\nFinally, albeit a subsequent event to the quarter, you might have noticed that we sold down also some stock for JDE Peet's. The transaction was equivalent to approximately $400 million through an equal combination of an outright sale and options at an all-in net discount of 2% to 3% versus the JDE stock price at the time of the transaction. options at maturity, which is about 6 months.\nBoth transactions put us in a good spot in terms of our leverage and debt profile. And together with the expected proceeds of developed market gap, pretty much balanced the outflows related to the acquisition of Clif and Ricolino.\nTurning to our outlook on Page 20. Given the strength of our Q1 results and the overall operating environment across our business, we are raising our full year outlook for revenue growth and EPS. We now expect top line growth of 10% plus versus our original outlook of 5% to 7%. EPS growth is expected to be 10% plus versus our previous outlook of high single-digit growth. In terms of the assumptions, inflation is still expected to increase double digit for 2023, driven by elevated costs in packaging, energy, ingredients and labor while lapping favorable hedges in 2022. In terms of interest expenses, we now expect $400 million for the year, given recent coffee transactions. We now expect $0.09 of EPS of headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.04 in our previous outlook.\nThe outlook revision reflects our increased confidence in another exceptionally strong year given the resilience of consumer consumption in our categories, more benign elasticities than we planned and share dynamics in half 2 as well as lower actual disruption and better environment in Europe. Having said that, we might have some more disruption for the remaining pricing, which will potentially affect Q2. Finally, continued strength in our emerging markets is what supports our improved guidance. This current outlook does not consider a material deterioration of geopolitical environment surrounding some areas of our business.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVP of IR, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nAs we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.\nToday, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another record year not only in size of the company but also in profit dollar growth. Our strong top line performance was driven by excellent pricing execution and continued volume strength, as consumers all over the world remain loyal to our iconic snacking brands. We delivered strong top line performance in both emerging and developed markets while continuing to exercise cost discipline.\nIn keeping with our strategy of achieving global snacking leadership, we continue investing in our brands and capabilities while strengthening our portfolio with important bolt-on acquisitions that increase our exposure to attractive and growing categories and profit pools.\nWe executed well against our long-term algorithm, returning $4 billion in capital to shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to invest in our people, building a deep and diverse team whose local roots and global insights enable us to stay a step ahead of rapidly changing customer and consumer tastes. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued investments and especially our great people position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2023 and beyond.\nAlong with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress towards our environmental, social and governance agenda. You recall from our investor update last spring that we have elevated sustainability as the fourth pillar of our growth acceleration strategy. That's because we firmly believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of our value creation with positive returns for all our stakeholders.\nLet me share a few highlights on Slide 5, sorry. First, we continued to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourcing cocoa and wheat, our 2 most critical ingredients. We launched the next chapter of Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program with another $600 million commitment, bringing our total investment to $1 billion. Cocoa Life is working to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa grows. Similarly, we will launch in the first quarter of 2023 an updated vision for our Harmony Wheat program focused on more sustainably sourcing wheat across the European Union.\nWe continued advancing our Light and Right packaging strategy. For example, our Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand now are wrapped in packaging with more than 30% recycled content. We also continue to make progress on tackling climate change. We expanded our use of renewable energy to reduce our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions. And in about 80% of farms in our Cocoa Life program in West Africa, we achieved near to no deforestation, reducing Scope 3 emissions.\nSince 2018, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by more than 20%. We also remain focused on advancing diversity, equity and inclusion because we firmly believe that diverse perspectives and viewpoints make our company stronger while helping us stay closer to our customers and consumers. As an example, we increased the gender and racial diversity of our Board of Directors with the appointment of industry-leading experts. We are proud of team Mondelez' continued success in making important impacts on these critical environmental, social and government issues while creating value for our shareholders and other key stakeholders.\nTurning to Slide 6. You can see that we had a record year despite challenging operating conditions. We view our strong performance in '22 as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to deliver for our stakeholders. Organic volume grew 2.7% for the year, on pace with recent years, demonstrating the continued strength of our resilient brands and categories even in an inflationary environment.\nOrganic net revenue grew by 12.3%, significantly lapping the prior 3 years' performance with broad-based growth across all regions. We also delivered record adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $1.4 billion. We are proud of our team's ability to offset major cost pressures to enable us to continue investing in the business, which will drive further growth acceleration. Accordingly, we increased A&C investment by double digits, helping to keep our brands top of mind for both consumers and customers.\nThese pricing, cost management and investing activities translated into strong operating income growth of more than $580 million. We remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, which fuels local-first commercial investment and execution will continue to consistently deliver attractive profit growth. We are especially confident that our unique growth strategy centered on acceleration and focus will enable us to continue to successfully navigate the dynamic global operating environment, differentiating us from many other food companies.\nOn Slide 7, you can see that, despite the volatile environment, we have the right setup and strategy to ensure we deliver against our growth algorithm. Momentum in emerging markets with particularly China and India showing strong results, combined with the resilience of our categories as evidenced by strong volume growth is helping us to offset the challenges that many companies are facing, such as global cost inflation, the energy crisis, recession concerns in Europe and supply chain volatility.\nOur consumer continues to hold up well across most geographies, prioritizing snacking and buying more volumes of our products despite significant price increases. Our U.S. supply chain is gradually getting back to normal after a long period of suboptimal customer service triggered by the 2021 strike and the subsequent overall supply chain volatility. We are continuing to implement appropriate incremental price increases across key markets, including Europe. We also continue to take appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs while continuing to advance our ongoing productivity initiatives.\nAll of the above allows us to increase our investment in brands and capabilities every year, which underpins our growth momentum. Our ability to deliver real dollar growth enables us to make sound and choiceful decisions that drive the business forward and position us well for continued future growth.\nSlide 8 shows that our performance in 2022 gives us confidence that we have not only the right growth plan but also the right execution to deliver it. Our core categories of chocolate and biscuits remain attractive and durable in both developed and emerging markets. We are accelerating our focus on these core categories because they have attractive growth and profitability characteristics and still a significant headroom in terms of penetration and per capita consumption.\nOur long-term vision is to generate 90% of revenue through these 2 core categories. We hit an exciting milestone in the biscuit category this year as Oreo surpassed $4 billion in global net revenue, further solidifying its position as the world's favorite cookie. Our acquisitions of Chipita and Clif Bar helped us expand our footprint in the growing baked snacks segment, while our acquisition of Ricolino helped us fill an important geographic white space, establishing a strong foothold in a priority emerging market of Mexico.\nWe also continue to expand our presence in high-growth channels, segments and price tiers. For example, Silk premium chocolate doubled its prior year penetration in India; while in emerging markets, we added more than 400,000 additional outlets. And we have significant runway ahead of us. These are just a few examples of the ways our teams remain relentlessly focused on delivering the growth and acceleration plan we outlined at our Investor Day last spring.\nAs Slide 9 indicates, we continue working hard to reshape our portfolio, which will accelerate our growth, and I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress in 2022. As we continue to drive focus on chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, our 9 strategic acquisitions since 2018 have enabled us to enter exciting adjacent spaces such as well-being and premium. They also have strengthened our presence in key geographies and expanded our trade coverage. Together, these acquisitions add nearly $3 billion in revenues and are all growing high single or double digits.\nStrong execution against our proven integration playbook enabled us to rapidly realize the value of the 3 acquisitions we closed in 2022. The Chipita business provides us an important platform to further accelerate growth in the attractive biscuits and baked snacks category. Similarly, Clif Bar expands our global snack bar business to more than $1 billion. Additionally, Ricolino, Mexico's leading confectionary company, doubles the size of our business and more than triples our routes to market in Mexico.\nAlong with successfully integrating these 3 businesses, we announced in late 2022 the sale of our developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle for an implied EBITDA multiple of about 15x. This divestiture will help fund these recent acquisitions and streamline our portfolio. We continue to have the Halls business, which has been performing well but still intend to divest it over time in a way that maximizes value.\nIn conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2022 was a record year. Our focus and portfolio reshaping strategy is working, and we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth in 2023 and beyond. By continuing to double down on the attractive chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories, investing in our iconic brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2022, we delivered unprecedentedly strong results, starting with double-digit top line growth through both volume and value, which in turn translated into strong gross profit dollar growth, allowing reinvestment in the business, solid earnings and cash flow. Growth was also broad-based in terms of regions, categories and brands. Revenue growth was 12.3% and 15.4% for the year and the quarter, respectively. Importantly, nearly 3 points of full year growth and 1.6 points of Q4 came from volume mix.\nEmerging markets increased 22% for the year and 24.7% for the quarter, with strong performance across a significant majority of countries, including Brazil, China, India, Russia, Mexico, the Western Andean countries and Southeast Asia. More than 7 points of full year growth in emerging markets was driven by volume mix, confirming the great momentum of these geographies.\nDeveloped markets grew 7% for the year and 10.5% for the quarter. Volume mix in developed markets was flat in Q4 as there were still some ongoing negotiations at the beginning of the quarter in the EU that resulted in customer disruption, which in turn offset some good momentum in countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia and others. Those negotiations are now fully closed, but we have just announced another pricing round in Europe.\nTurning to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Our chocolate and biscuit businesses both delivered double-digit growth, while gum and candy continue to recover with improved mobility. Biscuits grew 11.7% for the year and 18% for the quarter, supported by significant volume growth. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Tate's, Give & Go and Club Social were among the brands that performed very well.\nChocolate grew more than 10% for both the year and quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was virtually flat in Q4 due to customer disruption in Europe. Emerging markets posted exceptional double-digit growth for the year and the quarter. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta and Toblerone, all delivered robust growth. Gum and candy grew 25% for the year and the quarter. Brazil, Mexico and the Western Andean area all performed well.\nNow let's review market share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 40% of our revenue base, which includes 15 points of headwinds coming from the U.S. supply chain that, while improving, still weighs on the full year share performance. Chocolate held or gained share in 50% of our revenue base. This number includes a strong Christmas season with gains in several key countries but also reflects customer disruption in Europe. Retailer and consumer activities are now vastly restored in the region, but the price that we just announced might have a negative impact in the first 2 quarters of 2023 as far as share goes.\nOur biscuit business held or gained share in 25% of our revenue base. This includes 30 points of headwinds from the U.S. supply constraint and customer disruption in Europe. The U.S. made significant service level improvements in the back half of 2022, narrowing share losses, and we expect this trajectory to continue to improve in 2023.\nTurning to Page 14. For the year, we delivered strong double-digit OI dollar growth driven by a record-high increase in gross profit of nearly $1.4 billion. In Q4, we also saw strong double-digit OI and gross profit dollar growth.\nMoving to regional performance on Slide 15. Europe grew 7.4% for the year and 8.7% for the quarter. Thanks to strong execution, volume mix was flat for the year despite customer disruption in Q3 and Q4. Brand support remains a priority in the region, and we have continued to increase our A&C.\nOI dollars for the year were up 4.3% and 12.4% for the quarter and the year, respectively. Q4 profitability saw a return to growth due to an additional price increase and the emerging market performance within the segment.\nTo close on Europe, we continue to see more pronounced inflation in this region based on energy and other input costs. We also expect to see challenged margins in Q1 given our expectations of customer disruption. Although we saw a small uptick in elasticity for Q4, the European consumer has continued to hold up well, and the preference for snacking and trusted brands remain strong with elasticity levels below normal.\nNorth America grew 12.3% for the full year and 19.5% for the quarter. Higher pricing, robust volume mix and strength from our ventures such as Tate's and Give & Go fueled those increases. Volume mix was 0.8% for the year and 4.2% for the quarter.\nNorth America profit increased 18.7% for the year and 37.3% for the quarter due to strong pricing and healthy volume results. Besides the benefit of our pricing execution, the consumer remains resilient, and elasticity continues to be well below normal levels.\nAMEA grew 12.5% for the year and 13.6% for the quarter, with strong volume growth for both periods. India grew strong double digits for the year and quarter driven by both chocolate and biscuit. China increased high single digits for the year despite COVID restrictions in certain cities and posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Finally, Southeast Asia also delivered strong double-digit growth for both periods. AMEA increased dollars by 9.8% for the year and 8.8% for the quarter, continuing their virtual cycle.\nLatin America grew 31.9% for the year and 37.1% for the quarter, with robust volume mix growth coupled with strong price contribution. All key markets posted double-digit increases for the quarter. Latin America has had its strongest year ever in terms of OI delivery. In fact, OI dollars in Latin America grew 48.5% for the year and more than 45% for the quarter. Broad-based volume growth, pricing and ongoing improvement from the gum and candy categories drove these results.\nNext to EPS on Slide 16. Full year EPS grew 11.9% in constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by operating gains. And despite very significant currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS at reported ForEx by 3.5%.\nTurning to Slide 17. We delivered $3 billion of free cash flow for the full year, including a onetime expense of $300 million related to the Clif acquisition and buyout of its employee stock ownership plan.\nTurning to outlook on Page 19. For the current year, we expect to deliver on or in excess of our long-term algorithm for all variables. There might still be meaningful variability for the year, so we expect plus 5% to plus 7% organic net revenue growth, which stems from the higher pricing. We also expect on-algo adjusted EPS, up high single digits. Somewhat like 2022, we expect a slightly different shape related to the P&L with higher top line, strong profit dollar growth and lower-than-historical margin rates given elevated inflation and related pricing away in dollar terms.\nAs far as assumptions go, we are planning for another year of double-digit inflation with dollars higher than in '22. This inflation is driven by the continued elevated cost in packaging, energy, ingredients and labor. These input costs are also more pronounced in Europe and some select emerging markets. We also had favorable coverage versus the market in '22. And although spot rates have been easing in many cases, new hedges are coming at higher levels than what was incorporated in March of last year.\nWe are taking action with a flexible hedging program by using options to minimize risk and volatility whether commodity rise or fall significantly from current rates. That is to reassure you that in case of commodity price dislocations, we will still be in a position to hit our profit commitment while still investing for growth.\nIn terms of interest expenses, we expect an incremental $90 million for the line associated with the financing of recent acquisitions that we plan to repay later in the year with the developed gum divestiture proceeds. We are planning for a net increase in total pension costs of around $25 million as above-the-line service costs will be lower and below-the-line elements will be worse due to the rising interest rate.\nImportant to note that due to our strong funding levels, we do not have to make additional contributions to our plan. We will also benefit from the high OI dollar contribution from the acquisitions of Clif and Ricolino and their related synergies.\nIn terms of phasing, we expect Q1 to be lower from a margin rate perspective due to lower volumes in Europe associated with the expected customer disruptions and Chinese New Year phasing. Disruption in Europe might also continue into Q2. We are expecting $0.04 of EPS headwinds related to ForEx.\nWith respect to free cash flow, we expect another strong year with $3.3 billion plus, absent any significant onetime nonoperating items. In this outlook, we also expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today and a share repurchase of around $2 billion.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVP of IR, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nAs we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our Q3 2022 earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.\nToday, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will review our financial results and outlook. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we delivered another robust quarter with high quality top line growth, continued strength in both developed and emerging markets and strong profit dollar growth. This execution, combined with continued acceleration of our strategic initiatives, supports raising our full year revenue growth and adjusted EPS outlook.\nReinvesting in our business is one of the best ways we can deploy capital. And I'm happy to say that we continue to increase investments in our brands and capabilities that should reinforce and build upon our strong foundation. We also continue to make great progress in reshaping our portfolio with the full integration of our Chipita business as well as the closing of our acquisitions of Clif Bar and Ricolino. We remain confident that the strength of our brands and our proven strategy position us well to deliver attractive, sustainable growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Above all, we remain extremely confident in our people who remain relentlessly focused on delivering the right snacks for the right moment made the right way to consumers around the world.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. We are well positioned to deliver a strong full year '22 performance and long-term revenue growth. This quarter, our revenue growth was 12.1%, which means 11.2% growth year-to-date. The revenue was generated through continued volume growth as well as strong pricing necessary because of ongoing cost inflation, and it demonstrates the resilient demand for our brands. That revenue growth is fueling our gross profit, which is growing 12.8% for the quarter and 10.8% year-to-date.\nThis very strong gross profit growth is allowing us to increase our A&C investments high single digit, which in turn will help us to continue to drive sustainable top line and repeating the virtuous cycle. The strong gross profit growth also generated, after investments, operating income growth of 9.6% for the quarter and 10.6% year-to-date while delivering great free cash flow results.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, we delivered 12.1% organic net revenue growth in Q3. Volume remained solid relative to much of the sectors as consumers continue to choose our trusted and beloved brands even as we implement necessary pricing. We view our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date as further evidence that our long-term strategy continues to pay off. Since the launch of our new growth plan in 2018, we have consistently over-delivered on net revenue growth through a virtuous cycle of increasing investment, strong local execution and targeted incentives. We remain confident that this strategy will continue to deliver attractive growth in the quarters and years to come.\nLike many companies, as shown on Slide 7, we continue to navigate through a dynamic operating environment, driven by cost inflation, the energy crisis in Europe and supply chain volatility. Let's take a closer look at each of these dynamics and the steps we are taking to address them. First, we continue to face elevated input cost inflation, especially in the areas of energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. To offset these challenges, we have implemented appropriate price increases across key markets, including Europe.\nAdditionally, we have announced further pricing actions across numerous markets across the globe, including the United States, which takes effect in December '22, and we are preparing for '23 negotiations in other markets. We also continue to take appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs with greater flexibility while continuing to advance our ongoing productivity initiatives.\nSecond, in terms of energy inflation and continuity, we remain focused on risk management tools and alternative sources to help mitigate the impact. And third, we continue to manage through volatility in the supply chain, especially in the U.S. due to labor shortages at third party as well as a continuing shortage of trucking capacity and containers. We are prioritizing key SKUs to protect share and continue to make progress in improving manufacturing and warehouse capacity.\nTurning to our categories and the consumer on Page 8. Our latest research shows that snacking continues to play a central role in consumers' lives. And as a result, our core categories of chocolate and biscuits remain resilient. Consumers in developed markets continue to prioritize groceries over other forms of spending, and they continue to view our brands as affordable indulgences. Meanwhile, in emerging markets, consumer confidence remains strong with growing demand for our categories and continued loyalty to our iconic brands.\nBecause of this enduring brand loyalty, private label share is either flat or down in the vast majority of our markets. Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories. With the return to school, we are seeing growth in products popular for school lunches like biscuit multipacks here in the U.S. We're also seeing continued growth in chocolate bars, treat sizes, gifting and seasonal shapes in Europe.\nLooking forward to the Christmas season, the majority of European consumers say they plan to spend the same amount over the holidays, if not more, as in 2021. They also say they plan to spend more money at home and on gifting with less money spent on dining out and entertainment. These category dynamics combined with the enduring strength of our trusted and beloved brands give us confidence that we will continue to successfully navigate inflationary periods like today.\nMoving to our efforts around portfolio reshaping on Slide 9. I'm pleased to share that we are continuing to advance our strategy of strengthening our leadership in core categories through our acquisition and divestment approach complemented by strong integration playbook. Over the summer, we completed the integration of Chipita, a high-growth European leader in packaged croissants and baked snacks. Chipita provides us an important platform to further accelerate growth in the attractive biscuits and baked snacks category.\nMore recently, we closed our acquisition of Clif Bar & Company, expanding our global snack bar business to more than $1 billion, anchored by the marquee brand widely loved for taste and sustainability. This business is up low double digits on a year-to-date basis and we are excited to take this great brand to the next level. And just today, we closed our acquisition of Ricolino, Mexico's leading confectionary company, doubling the size of our business and more than tripling our routes to market in the high-priority Mexican market.\nThese are just the latest steps in our ongoing commitment to accelerate focus on our core categories, filling geographical white spaces, expanding our presence in high-growth channels and growing our presence in key segments and price tiers. We're confident that this focus will allow us to drive sustained growth accretive to our algorithm across the portfolio.\nAs we continue to accelerate our focus on growth, we remain committed to doing our part to drive positive change at scale. At our investor update earlier this year, we announced that we have elevated sustainability to become the fourth pillar of our company's long-term growth strategy. Within this framework, you can see on Slide 10 that we recently launched the next chapter of Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program.\nCocoa Life already has delivered strong results. Over the past decade, farmer net incomes have increased about 15% in Ghana and about 33% in Côte d'Ivoire. Children are better protected with more robust monitoring and remediation system, and we're helping to prevent deforestation by educating farmers about optimal farming practices. But cocoa farmers and their communities still face big systemic challenges. That's why we're investing another $600 million, bringing our total investments to $1 billion with an aim to source 100% of our cocoa volume through Cocoa Life farmers by 2030.\nWhile we are excited about the promise of these investments, we continue to call for more collaborative efforts and collective actions to drive greater impact, including new private-public collaborations. We are proud of our leadership in helping to make cocoa right, and we'll keep you updated on our progress.\nFinally, before I hand over to Luca for more details on our financials, I would like to make -- sorry, to take a moment to share some updates to our leadership team. First, I would like to congratulate Sandra MacQuillan, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, on her well-deserved retirement. Since joining Mondelez in 2019, Sandra has brought focus and clarity to our supply chain organization, with a people-first leadership style and an unrelenting commitment to doing it right from shelf to field. We thank her for her tremendous contributions.\nFrank Cervi has assumed the role of Chief Supply Chain Operations Officer, reporting directly to me. Frank is a proven leader, bringing more than 30 years of global supply chain experience to the table. He has a strong drive for executional excellence, tackling big challenges and pursuing continuous improvement. His recent roles within Mondelez, including, most recently, leading supply chain strategy, position him well for continued success.\nAdditionally, after a successful 34-year career in research and development, Rob Hargrove, our Chief R&D Officer, will be retiring January 2023. During his tenure with Mondelez, Rob successfully transformed the R&D function from a complex blend of category and geographic activities to a well-connected, technically rigorous global community. We thank him for his many years of dedication and accomplishments.\nWith Rob's retirement, we welcome Daniel Ramos as our new Chief Research and Development Officer, reporting directly to me effective November 8. Daniel is a seasoned global executive with more than 25 years of R&D and consumer-centric innovation expertise. He joins us from The Estée Lauder Companies where he had a strong focus on advancing sustainable packaging initiatives.\nOne final piece of leadership news, Javier Polit, our Chief Digital and Information Officer, is now serving on our Mondelez leadership team, providing enhanced strategic oversight as we advance our commitment to becoming the digital snacks leaders. Since joining the company almost 3 years ago, Javier has elevated our technology initiatives and infrastructure at both the global and business unit levels. Javier will continue to report to Luca. With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results were strong from volume, revenue, profit dollar growth to cash flow generation. In addition, growth was broad-based across categories and brands. We delivered revenue growth of more than 12% with 1 point of growth driven by volume/mix. Emerging markets were a clear highlight for the quarter with broad-based trends on both top and bottom lines. Emerging markets net revenue grew more than 24% in the quarter, with 8 points of that growth coming from volume/mix. Developed markets grew 5.2%. Volume/mix was down 3 points, entirely as a result of customer disruptions in Europe related to pricing negotiation, nearly all of which has since been resolved.\nTurning to portfolio performance on Slide 13. Our chocolate and biscuit franchises continue to demonstrate their resilience and deliver strong results while ongoing improvements in mobility helped fuel robust gum and candy performance. Biscuits grew 11.5% for the quarter, with nearly 1 point coming from volume, albeit mix was negative as we suffered from customer disruption in Europe. Emerging markets again grew strong double digit, while developed markets increased high single digit. Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, Triscuit and Club Social were among brands that deliver outstanding growth.\nChocolate grew more than 9%, of which 1.3 points were driven by volume/mix, with increases in both emerging and developed markets. Emerging markets posted exceptional growth of strong double digit. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Toblerone, Lacta and Bis all grew double digits. Gum & Candy grew more than 22%. Brazil, Mexico, Western Andean and Middle East, North Africa, all performed very well.\nNow let's review our market share performance on Slide 14. We held or gained share in 45% of our revenue base, which includes 20 points of headwind coming from U.S. supply chain constraints. We are seeing gradual improvements in share and service levels as we closed the quarter and early into the fourth quarter. And in fact, share in the U.S. should turn positive for the last few readings of the year, and we should enter next year with a favorable trajectory.\nChocolate performed well with 65% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. This number is still reflective of our good execution in the category and our ongoing investment, but some headwinds are expected, given the customer disruption in Europe. Our biscuit business held or gained share in 35% of our revenue base. This includes 35 points of headwinds from the U.S. supply chain.\nNow turning to Page 15. In Q3, we posted gross profit dollar growth of plus 13% and plus 10% for EBIT. Year-to-date, we have delivered nearly $900 million in absolute gross profit dollar growth, a record high for our business. This dollar growth enables us to continue investing in brand-building to drive our virtuous cycle of growth. Although organic top line and profit dollar growth are key focus areas, cost excellence remains an important part of our DNA and an enabler in this environment. To that end, we continue to make good progress around digitizing the enterprise and realizing efficiencies, reducing nonessential overhead spend and driving simplification.\nTurning to regional performance on Slide 16. Europe grew 5.2% during the quarter. This includes nearly 5 points of volume/mix decline entirely linked to customer disruptions from a round of pricing negotiations during Q3. Importantly, as I already said, we have successfully implemented virtually all of the price planned. We continue to support our brands with meaningful investments in the region to ensure consumers stay loyal to our categories and franchises. OI dollar for the quarter declined by 7.4%, driven by customer volume disruption and ongoing commodity pressure. Now that pricing has been implemented, we expect margin recovery for Europe in Q4.\nNorth America grew 12% in Q3, driven by higher pricing in biscuits, strong candy growth and robust increases from our ventures businesses, particularly Tate's and Give & Go. Volume/mix was roughly flat. North America OI increased by more than 20% during the quarter due to higher pricing that was implemented in Q2 as well as some benefits related to the factory closings last year and the addition of Clif. AMEA grew 14.6% for the quarter with strong volume/mix growth of 8.5 points and broad-based growth across all of our business units in the region.\nIndia grew strong double digit for the quarter, driven by both chocolate and biscuits. China increased high single digits despite COVID restrictions in certain cities, while Southeast Asia delivered robust double-digit growth across all snacking categories and Australia grew mid-single digit. AMEA increased OI dollars by 17.2% for the quarter as volume leverage and pricing were partially offset by commodity and transportation inflation.\nLatin America grew 31.6% with mid-single-digit volume/mix growth. Similar to Q2, this trend was extensive with double-digit increases across every single category. Brazil, Mexico, Western Andean business unit all posted double-digit increases for the quarter. OI dollars in Latin America grew nearly 50% for the quarter. This increase was driven by broad-based volume growth, pricing and ongoing improvements from the Gum & Candy categories.\nNext to EPS on Slide 17. Q3 EPS grew 15.7% at constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by operating gains. And despite significant currency headwinds, we grew reported dollars by nearly 6% in the quarter and 4% on a year-to-date basis.\nTurning to Slide 18. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.9 billion, including a onetime expense of $300 million related to the Clif acquisition and buyout of the non-vested employee stock ownership plan. This was part of the originally disclosed purchase price, but as it relates to the ease up for employees and deemed compensation, it is reflected in cash flow. This strong free cash flow performance has enabled us to return $3.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchases and dividends.\nTurning to our outlook on Page 20. We continue to see positive momentum in the business as a result of our strong position within attractive categories, significant brand support and consistent execution. For the time being, our categories are resilient and continue to see lower elasticities than historical levels. Given the strength of our performance through the first 3 quarters, the successful implementation of pricing in Europe and the overall health of demand trends in our business, we now expect, for the full year: organic net revenue to grow 10%-plus versus our prior outlook of 8%-plus; adjusted EPS to increase 10%-plus versus our previous outlook of mid- to high single digit; and free cash flow of $3 billion-plus, which includes the $300 million of expenses related to the Clif ease-up, which would indicate stronger underlying results.\nWe continue to expect broad-based growth in our core categories and markets. We also expect a significant contribution from pricing, and we continue to plan for double-digit cost inflation. We have just announced another round of pricing in the U.S. to reflect continued inflation and positive impact of our commodities coverage in 2022 seizing current spot levels in 2023. While we successfully concluded our European pricing with disruption below our anticipated levels, inflation continues to be a concern in Europe, particularly with energy, that despite some EU-driven measures is still a significant headwind.\nEnergies has broad repercussions, both on pack cost and other raw materials. We expect another round of pricing in Europe as we enter next year. Our EPS outlook also now factors in $0.26 of headwinds related to ForEx impact. $0.19 of this amount have already been included in our first 3 quarters. At current ForEx levels and outlook, EPS in reported dollars would be positive year-on-year, which shows the resilience of our business. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVP of IR, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nOperator, we're ready for the first question.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nOperator?",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVP of IR, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nAs we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the presentation.\nIn today's call, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will take you through our financial results and our outlook. We will close with Q&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4.\nI'm pleased to share that we have delivered a strong first half of the year with robust volume growth and solid pricing execution that supports raising our full year revenue growth outlook to 8% plus. Our core chocolate and biscuit businesses continue to demonstrate volume and pricing resilience as consumers around the world continue to seek out our trusted and iconic brands to meet their snacking needs.\nAnd although we may see a more mixed consumer sentiment in the near term given the macro environment, we expect the consumers to consume more at home and be more selective in the brands they buy, which we believe to be a net positive for (inaudible). We also continue to effectively navigate a dynamic operating environment. Input cost inflation remains challenging. And although we may see commodity inflation beginning to ease, we expect other costs like wages to show significant inflation.\nOur strong track record in having cost efficiency and simplification positions us well to mitigate the impact of these inflationary factors. At the same time, our consistent results enable us to maintain our course in driving a virtuous cycle where strong net revenue and gross profit (inaudible) to continuously invest in our brands, distribution capabilities and acquisitions.\nWe also continue to make great progress in reshaping our portfolio. A great example of that is our agreement to acquire Clif Bar, which will improve our position in the attractive and fast-growing snack bar category. I'll share some additional context on the exciting (inaudible) in a few minutes.\nAlong with the Clif acquisition, we announced plans to divest our developed market Gum & Halls businesses, allowing us to focus our portfolio and further invest in our faster-growing businesses of chocolate and biscuits. We remain confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy and our increasing investments position us well to deliver attractive sustainable growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nAbove all, I am extremely confident in our people, who continue to demonstrate exceptional passion and dedication to serving our consumers despite ongoing challenges with inflation, (inaudible) and periodic (inaudible) in COVID conditions.\nDay in and day out are 80,000-plus makers and bakers who strive to help people snack right. We respect and honor our colleagues around the world, and we truly believe that team Mondelez is a very (inaudible) [theme] in the consumer packaged goods industry.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. The strength of our brands, increasing investments, volume growth and significant pricing actions are sustaining top line momentum and solid profitability despite substantial inflation. We grew revenue this quarter by 13.1% and 10.7% for the first half of the year. We delivered gross profit growth of 9.7% due to healthy volume growth and pricing actions.\nOur A&C investments have increased double digits as to gain or hold share across more than half our revenue base and positioning us well for future periods. An example of our commitment to brand investment is the renovation of Milka to make this leading chocolate brand the most tender and creamy ever.\nThis program includes an upgraded taste profile, creamier (inaudible) and distinctive packaging, celebrating the brand's Alpine soul. This initiative represents our largest chocolate brand renovation in 25 years. Illustration of the campaign is featured on our earnings presentation coverage page.\nWe are supporting the launch with a fully integrated 18-month marketing and advertising support program starting in H2 '22. And last, we increased operating income by 8.5% for the quarter and 11.2% (inaudible) first half while delivering great free cash flow results.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, we delivered 10 points growth during the first half of the year. We view this strong performance as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to pay off. In late 2018, we launched a new growth plan focused on gross profit dollar growth, local first commercial execution, a virtuous cycle of increasing investment and a new approach to (inaudible) incentives. We are (inaudible) that this approach will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth.\nImportantly, we are also delivering strong volume, which is important to (inaudible). It is a proof that consumers are eating more of our products every day and an indication of sustainable long-term growth.\nLike many companies, as shown on Slide 7, we are experiencing a dynamic operating environment driven by global cost inflation, supply chain volatility and currency headwinds. Let's take a closer look at each of these dynamics and the steps we are taking to address them.\nFirst, we continue to (inaudible) elevated input cost inflation especially in the areas of energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. To offset these challenges, we recently announced further pricing actions across key markets and continue to (inaudible) appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs along with ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives.\nSecond, we continue to manage through volatility in the supply chain, especially in the United States due to labor shortages at third parties as well as the continuing gap in demand and supply of trucking capacity containers. Although we do have more work to do, we are making progress against our plans to unlock manufacturing warehouse capacity, improve service levels and implement new measures to support employee retention.\nThird, we are working through the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar particularly against the (inaudible) and the British pound by focusing on what we can control. This includes mitigating our translation exposure through currency hedges and net investment hedges. Delivering a (inaudible) real dollar earnings is an ongoing focus. And though we may see some significant currency (inaudible) in the short term, we have delivered robust real dollar earnings growth over the past several years.\nTurning to our categories and the consumer on Page 8. Our annual state of snacking survey shows that consumers increasingly prefer snacking over traditional meals. And because snacking plays such an important role in consumers' lives, our core categories of chocolate and biscuits historically have (inaudible) resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions.\nThis trend continues to play out around the world despite an overall drop in consumer confidence. While developed (inaudible) consumers express growing frustration with rising prices for a broad range of goods and services, they continue to perceive chocolate and biscuits as affordable indulgences and an important pick-me-up. In fact, almost 40% of U.K. shoppers said that chocolate is a necessity and remains one of the best value snack products.\nDue to (inaudible) consumer loyalty, category volume growth and penetration is holding up well in most of our key developed (inaudible). Elasticity have notched up slightly but remained low compared to historical benchmarks. Private label is either flat or down in the vast majority of our markets, and shoppers say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories.\nMeantime, in emerging markets, consumer confidence remains relatively strong, recovering to almost pre-COVID levels. And our core category shows solid volume and penetration growth despite price increases. Compared to developed markets, emerging market consumers are less likely to reduce overall consumption of our categories or switch when faced with price increases.\nInstead, they are more (inaudible) switch stores to find deals on their favorite brands or look for different sizes. Overall, we remain confident that the strength of our beloved and trusted brands will continue to help us navigate inflationary periods like the one we (inaudible) today.\nMoving to our efforts around portfolio reshape on Slide 9. I'd like to share a bit more color on our recently announced agreement to acquire Clif Bar. Clif is a leader in high growth, well-being snack bars. The company's on-trend brands including CLIF, LUNA and CLIF Kids, a great addition to our global snacking portfolio, and they are differentiated (inaudible) page.\nEach of these brands is strong and healthy. Pretty high (inaudible) advocacy and loyalty. Clif also enjoys high brand loyalty among the 18 to 24 age group. The brand also performs well on key taste (inaudible) a critical differentiation across age groups in a category where many products (inaudible) so well.\nClif is also widely recognized as a leader in well-being and sustainable snacking. The company's purpose and culture are well aligned with our purpose of empowering people to snack right. We look forward to working with the passionate, dedicated Clif team to advance our (inaudible).\nOn Slide 10, you can see that we have moved from a small bar business in 2018 to about $300 million last year with the addition of Perfect Snacks and Grenade and to a $1 billion-plus global snack bar platform factoring Clif. This gives us an attractive position in a $16 billion market with revenues roughly split between U.S. and international. As a significant 700 million-plus presence in the U.S., protein and energy space, which is expected to continue to grow well over the coming years as a diverse range of consumers increasingly count snack bars as meal replacements, energy or a better way of snacking.\nSlide 11 shows that the Clif Bar acquisition offers an opportunity for us to (inaudible) business through our marketing expertise, operational excellence and financial discipline to create significant value. There are clear and substantial cost synergies, which include leveraging our experience with logistics and warehousing, reducing waste in existing (inaudible) in marketing and advertising to optimize A&C spend.\nIn terms of growth, we see substantial opportunities to increase household penetration and distribution in alternative (inaudible) and e-commerce as well as existing outlets. There is also an opportunity to unlock growth through revenue growth management and enhanced in-store excellence. And beyond the U.S., there are clear opportunities to drive international growth.\nWe are excited about the announcement to acquire the Clif business and the top and bottom line growth opportunities that lie ahead. We also see material upside to the returns versus our low cost of capital.\nMoving to Slide 12. Clif is just the latest example of our continuing efforts to reshape our portfolio through strategic M&A that increases our exposure to incremental fast-growing snacking segment. Since we announced our growth strategy in 2018, we have completed or announced 9 acquisitions that strengthen and complement our portfolio and fill key gaps, adding more than $2.8 billion in annual revenues and averaging growth in the high single digits.\nSo (inaudible) 2022, in addition to announcing the Clif transaction, we have closed and integrated our acquisition of Chipita, a high-growth European leader in croissants and baked (inaudible). And announced an agreement to acquire Ricolino, Mexico's leading confectionery company for Grupo Bimbo. These strategic acquisitions will complement and build on our substantial M&A progress in 2021, which brought us Grenade, a leading U.K. performance nutrition company; Gourmet Food Holdings, a leading Australian premium biscuit and cracker company; and Hu, a well-being snacking company in (inaudible).\nThese acquisitions have been regional in nature that can largely be managed by local teams. This includes the recent Chipita acquisition, which we successfully and rapidly traded at the end of Q2. We are confident that executing our strong patient playbook will allow us to drive sustained growth, accretive to our algorithm across the portfolio.\nWith that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our second quarter performance was once again strong with above expectations, outcomes across all P&L line (inaudible) cash. We delivered revenue growth of plus 19% with 5 points coming from volume/mix, showing the (inaudible) approach to supporting our brands and investing in capabilities, exploit our long runway of opportunities is paying off. Emerging market (inaudible) to show significant strength, posting an increase of more than 22% with great momentum across all our major business units. Importantly, volume/mix drove more than 10 points of this.\nDeveloped market grew plus 8.1% for the second quarter with trends in both (inaudible) and North America as demand (inaudible). Volume/mix was also positive in developed market, with approximately 4 points of volume in Europe. While U.S (inaudible) most likely negative given supply chain constraints.\nYou can see our portfolio performance on Slide 15. Chocolate and biscuits continue to exhibit strong and durability as (inaudible) making CapEx. Additionally, Gum & Candy continue to improve as global mobility increases coming out of the pandemic. Biscuits grew 10.4% for the quarter, with nearly 2 points coming from volume/mix. Emerging markets grew strong double digits, while developed markets increased high single digits. (inaudible) delivered strong increases includes Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, (inaudible), LU biscuits.\nChocolate grew more than [15%], with increases in both developed and emerging markets, including digit growth in Europe. Chocolate was driven by robust volume growth of plus 9% as consumers continue (inaudible) brands as an affordable indulgence. Both global and local product (inaudible) well, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, overall (inaudible). Gum & Candy grew nearly 26% (inaudible) Mexico, Middle East, North Africa all delivered strong growth.\nNow let's review our market share performance (inaudible) 16. We had (inaudible) in 55% revenue base during the first half with 20 points of headwind due to the service challenges in the U.S. We expect to see gradual improvement in the second half of the year. Our chocolate category performed well with 75% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. Our biscuits category had a gain share in 40% of our revenue (inaudible) 40 points of headwinds from supply chain constraints in North America. We are already seeing some improvements in service (inaudible) and share, but we expect (inaudible) improvement (inaudible) visible as the year progresses.\nNow on Page 17. We delivered high single-digit growth, both in terms of gross and operating profit. Importantly, the overall gross profit dollars delivery allowed us to reinvest in A&C by double digits in the quarter and obtain EBIT gains versus last year.\nTurning to regional performance on Slide 18. Europe grew 10.8% during the quarter, supported by great execution and strong growth across mass grocery as well as convenience away from home and travel retail channels. Results were driven by nearly 6% volume/mix. While dollar for the quarter declined a little over 1% by significant commodity pressure as well as the impact of the Ukraine war. The implementation of pricing will allow us to return to profit growth. Importantly, we continue to invest in A&C.\nNorth America grew 9.2% in Q2, driven by higher pricing in biscuits as well as double-digit Gum & Candy growth. Volume/mix was down 1% as a result of continued supply chain constraints. North America OI increased by 6.3% during the quarter due to higher (inaudible) that was announced in early (inaudible).\nAMEA grew 13.2% for the quarter, with strong volume/mix growth of 8.7 points, showing continued momentum in the (inaudible). India grew almost 30% in the quarter, driven by chocolate and biscuit. China increased high single digits despite restrictions in certain (inaudible). And Southeast Asia delivered single-digit growth with double-digit growth in [biscuits] and chocolate. AMEA increased OI dollars by 7.9% for the quarter as volume-driven profit was partially offset by commodities, transportation inflation and reinvestment in A&C.\nLatin America grew 33%, with double-digit volume/mix growth. Category strength was broad-based, small digit increases across the board. Brazil, Mexico and our Western Andean business unit all posted very strong double-digit increases similar to last quarter. (inaudible) dollars in Latin America increased more than 70% for the quarter. These increases were driven by broad-based volume-driven (inaudible) effective pricing to our [GM] actions and (inaudible) and candy sales.\nNow EPS on Slide 19. Q2 EPS grew 9.1% at constant currency. This growth was high quality as it was primarily driven by top line-related operating gains.\nOn Page 20. We remain focused on driving attractive top and bottom line performance, including real dollar earnings growth. Clearly, this is a challenging year in terms of exceptional currency headwinds for us and for our industry. By executing against our strategy and focusing on what we can control, our performance over the past 3 years has been quite strong, both on an absolute and relative basis. These results are even more impressive if you consider we invested materially in our brands and capabilities. Going forward, we will continue to take actions to drive strong profit dollar growth in constant and real dollars.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital return on Slide 21. We delivered first half free cash flow of $1.6 billion during the first half as a result of our strong growth and profitability. We also returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the same period. Our ongoing confidence in the business and cash generation enabled us to also announce a 10% increase to our cash dividend. Over the past 3 years, we have increased our dividend by more than 35%.\nBefore I cover our outlook, I wanted to make a comment on our focus now and going forward as it relates to the current environment. We have and will continue to take action to navigate some of the near-term dynamics around the inflation and supply chain constraints. How (inaudible) we remain true to our strategy and making the right decisions to drive attractive, profitable and sustainable growth for the long term. That means we remain committed to significantly investing behind our brands, driving volumes, generating healthy profit dollar growth and (inaudible) our market share. We believe this disciplined (inaudible) will create lasting and differentiated value for our consumers, customers and shareholders.\nWe also had a clear focus on strong earnings growth in constant real terms dollars. We have done this over the past 3 years despite a strong dollar. Although this year is shaping up to be more challenging, we believe we are well positioned to attract real dollar earnings in the years to come.\nNow let me provide some color on our revised 2022 outlook on Slide 24. Given our strong first half results, we now expect 8% plus top line growth. This revised top line outlook factors in a number of considerations, including the negative full year impact anticipated from the Ukraine war, including revenue losses related to products that previously were manufactured in the country and exported into Europe. This can be quantified in approximately 1 percentage point of equivalent revenue growth.\nSecond, some elements of customer disruption in Europe as a result of the second wave of price increases. While we have already been able to agree on most of the planned price increases in Europe, there are still some customers and countries where negotiations are underway. The size of customer disruption is difficult to predict, but we have factored into our guidance a certain impact, which is expected to be more pronounced in the third quarter.\nFinally, although elasticities have been at low levels through (inaudible), we are planning for them to return closer to historical levels in the second half as consumers continue to navigate inflationary trends and increased pricing across most markets.\nOur EPS outlook of mid- to high single digits is unchanged. And risk adjusted for additional inflation resulting from the Ukraine war, some customer disruption with respect to pricing and higher levels of elasticity. However, given the strength of our first half results and depending on the outcome of our pricing negotiations in Europe, we might finish in the upper part of this range.\nAs far as cost inflation goes, our expectations for low double-digit cost inflation for full year 2022 are confirmed. This earnings outlook also reflects $0.04 of EPS headwind from our stopped Ukraine operations. Additionally, this outlook reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our brands (inaudible) in media, not only during this period of elevated pricing, but importantly, to drive long-term growth.\nOur EPS outlook also now factors in $0.22 of (inaudible) related to ForEx impact. $0.12 of this amount has already been (inaudible) in our first (inaudible) results. With respect to free cash flow, our view is unchanged. We continue to expect $3 billion.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVP of IR, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, -Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nAs we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.\nIn today's call, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will take you through our financial results and outlook. We will close with Q&A.\nBefore turning it over to Dirk, a reminder that we have an investor update on May 10, and that will begin 9:00 Eastern, 8:00 Central, where Dirk, Luca and other senior leaders will talk more about the evolution of our strategy. More details will be on our IR website soon. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we have delivered an excellent start to the year, with robust volume growth, solid pricing, strong gross profit dollar growth and high cash delivery. Strong demand for snacks fueled broad-based growth all around the world, with the chocolate and biscuit categories continuing to demonstrate resilience. And price elasticity remaining below historical levels.\nWe also continue to effectively navigate a dynamic environment, characterized by global input cost inflation as well as lingering disruptions in the supply chain, labor and transportation. Throughout the quarter, we succeeded in mitigating these challenges through ongoing cost discipline and strategic pricing actions. At the same time, we continue to invest to support our brands, our distribution, our capabilities and acquisitions. We remain confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy and our continued investment position us well to deliver attractive, sustainable growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nIt is especially important to note that we remain extremely confident in our people the very best in the CPG industry. Each and every day, our makers and bakers around the world remain focused on delivering high-quality, great-tasting snacks to enrich the lives of consumers. No matter how the external environment shifts from one quarter to the next, are diverse and dedicated teams continue to deliver the brands our consumers love.\nTurning to Slide 5. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. The strength of our brands, our continuously increasing investments and significant pricing actions are sustaining top line momentum and solid profitability and position us well for another strong year in 2022. Our first quarter results show that we are off to a strong start. We grew revenue this quarter by 8.6%. We delivered gross profit growth of 9.9% due to higher pricing and robust volume. Our A&C investments have increased high single digits, and we gained our health share across half of our revenue base.\nWe increased operating income by 13.5% and delivered $1 billion in free cash flow. We view these results as a healthy indicator of our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, we are now averaging a 4.7% quarterly revenue growth rate since 2019. We feel good about this strong and consistent track record. In the second half of 2018, we shifted our paradigm on how to generate elevated growth by focusing on gross profit dollar growth, local first commercial execution, a virtuous cycle of always increasing investments and a new approach to incentives. We are confident that this approach will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth. We also believe this performance demonstrates not only the strength of our execution, but the attractiveness and durability of our core categories of chocolate and biscuit.\nAgainst that backdrop, I'm now on Slide 7, we are excited to provide some additional details on our recently announced acquisition of Ricolino, the #1 sugar confectionery and #4 chocolate player in our priority market of Mexico. This strategic acquisition will enable us to double our size in Mexico, a key priority market for us and Latin America's second largest market after Brazil. Ricolino has a broad portfolio of iconic, widely loved chocolate and candy brands include Ricolino, Vero, La Corona and Coronado.\nIn addition to the taste-of-the-nation brands, the organization's robust route-to-market infrastructure, which has more than 2,100 DSD routes that serve more than 440,000 traditional trade outlets, will enable us to rapidly expand our share in biscuits and chocolate. We also will benefit from 4 new manufacturing facilities with strong production capabilities. We expect this acquisition to rapidly drive value. Ricolino has been growing at an 8% CAGR with solid profitability over the past 5 years and currently delivers more than $500 million in net revenue. Its high strategic fit transforms our business with now 75% of revenues coming from core snacking categories and great opportunities for both revenue and cost synergies.\nLike other companies, as shown on Slide 8, we are experiencing a dynamic operating environment driven by global cost inflation and supply chain volatility. We condemn the war in Ukraine, which is not only causing great human suffering, but adds to an already very difficult cost and supply chain environment. Let's take a closer look at each of these dynamics and the steps we are taking to address them.\nFirst, we continue to face elevated input cost inflation, especially in the areas of energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. To offset these challenges, we recently announced further pricing actions across key markets. Additionally, our commodity costs are about 85% hedged for the year and near fully hedged in key areas. We are also continuing to accelerate productivity and throughput initiatives.\nSecond, we continue to manage through volatility in the supply chain, especially in the U.S., due to labor shortages at third parties as well as a continuing gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity and containers. To offset these challenges, we are continuing to improve our manufacturing and warehouse capacity, prioritizing key SKUs and implementing new measures to support employee retention.\nAnd third, we are working through numerous challenges related to the ongoing war in Ukraine. I would now like to spend a few minutes addressing our actions to care for and protect our people, as well as our operations in the region. First and foremost, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and all those around the world with family, friends and loved ones who have been impacted. The current situation is devastating, and we condemn this senseless violence.\nWe have taken a number of important steps to protect our colleagues, including strong financial support, border crossing assistance and help with finding housing. As part of these steps, we are continuing to pay our employees in Ukraine. Additionally, we are stepping up our commitment to relief efforts, dedicating so far 10 million to humanitarian support and food security. This includes donations to international and local aid organizations focused on supporting all people in Ukraine, but also with a specific focus on the communities where we have plans. On top of financial donations, our teams are providing on-the-ground help. For instance, we have helped transfer more than 100 children from Ukraine to Turkey, secured diesel generators to help provide power to critical public facilities and we are making food available in Ukraine, including product donations and working with distributors.\nOur 2 manufacturing operations in Ukraine have been shut down since the war began. Unfortunately, our site in Trostyanets has suffered significant damage due to the substantial military action in the area. Our site in Vyshhorod also remains closed. Thankfully, none of our employees were injured at either facilities. It is too early to provide you with potential next steps for the facilities, but we will work to make these facilities operational when the local situation allows. In terms of our business in Russia, as a food company, we have scaled back all nonessential activities, including stopping all new capital investments, any planned product launches and line extensions, commercial sponsorships and advertising. We are focused on local production of shelf-stable packaged snacks that are staples in people's daily lives. We also continue to provide support to our colleagues.\nWith that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our first quarter performance was strong from top to bottom to cash flow. We delivered revenue growth of 8.6%, with nearly 4 points of that growth coming from volume mix. Emerging markets continue to show great strength, posting an increase of more than 16%, with strengths across all our major business units. Importantly, volume mix dropped nearly 10 points of this growth, with notable performances from Brazil, India, China and Mexico. Developed markets grew 4.2% for the first quarter, with strength in both Europe and North America as demand remains strong. As for emerging market also, our developed market volume mix was positive, but pricing drove a good portion of that growth.\nTurning to our portfolio performance on Slide 11. Chocolate and biscuits continue to demonstrate strong growth and drive our business. Gum and candy also increased significantly as many areas are at or above prepandemic levels. Biscuits grew 6.7% for the quarter, with more than 2 points coming from volume mix. Similarly to Q4, emerging markets were a significant engine of growth in this category. Brazil, Mexico, India, Southeast Asia all grew double digit, while China posted high single-digit growth. Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, LU and [Tate's] are among those brands that delivered double-digit increases. Chocolate grew more than 8% for the quarter, with increases in both developed and emerging markets. Both global and local brands grew well, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone, Lacta and Bis. Gum and candy continued to show improvement with growth of 27% related to mobility increases. China, Brazil and Mexico were among some of the larger gum businesses posting strong performances.\nNow let's review our market share performance on Slide 12. We held or gained share in approximately 50% of our revenue base during the quarter, with approximately 25 points of headwind due to the inventory situation in the U.S. and related out of stock. Our chocolate category continued to do well, with 70% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. While our biscuit category held or gained share in 40% of our revenue base, the impact driven by lower inventory levels in North America following the Q3 strike and continued labor shortages at third-party manufacturers is worth 40 points of headwind. We expect these dynamics to improve as we move into the second half of the year. A few of the more notable areas of share gains in Q1 include China, India, Brazil, Mexico, U.K. and France Biscuit; U.K., Brazil and South Africa chocolate; and China gum. As we move into Q2, we expect our chocolate share to improve in several key markets in Europe and EMEA due to Easter timing where our portfolio is especially strong.\nNow turning to Page 13. For the quarter, profitability was strong due to higher pricing, strong volume leverage and the benefit of hedges related to currency and commodities.\nTurning to regional performance on Slide 14. Europe grew 4.9% during the quarter, supported by great execution, a strong Easter performance and continued recovery in the convenience away-from-home and travel retail channels. Our results were driven by 3.4 points of volume growth with strong increases in many markets, including the U.K. as well as Central and Eastern Europe. In chocolate, we delivered our best Easter ever with strong sell-in and sellout for the U.K. and Germany. Biscuits also delivered strong mid-single-digit growth. OI dollar growth for the quarter was more than 10%, driven by continued volume leverage, pricing and strong cost control as well as favorable commodity ForEx hedges.\nNorth America grew 7.7% in Q1, driven by higher pricing in biscuits as well as double-digit gum and candy growth. Volume mix was slightly positive, despite lower service levels related to third-party labor constraints. North America OI increased by 13.6% during the quarter due to higher pricing. We announced an additional mid-single-digit pricing increase in the U.S. that will become effective early May. EMEA grew 8.9% for the quarter with strong volume growth of 6.4%, showing continued strength across much of the region. India grew double digits for the quarter and continues to execute well and reinvest for the future. We continue to extend our leadership position in chocolate while the growth of our biscuit business continues to outpace larger competitors in the region.\nChina grew high single digits for the quarter, driven by continued share and gains in both biscuits and gum, despite several challenges due to COVID restrictions. Southeast Asia delivered high single-digit growth, with strength in biscuit, chocolate and beverages. EMEA increased OI dollars by 5.8% for the quarter as volume-driven profit was partially offset by commodities and transportation inflation. Latin America grew more than 25% for the quarter, with strong growth across all categories, driven by both strong pricing and volume mix gains. Brazil, Mexico and our Western Andean business unit all posted double-digit increases this quarter.\nAdjusted OI dollars for Latin America increased more than 30% for the quarter. These increases were driven by broad-based volume growth across core snacking categories, effective pricing through RGM actions and the mix impact of higher gum and candy sales.\nMoving to EPS. Q1 EPS grew 13.9% at constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by top line-driven operating gains.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital return on Slide 16. We delivered Q1 free cash flow of $1 billion, driven by strong operating results and further improvements in our cash conversion cycle. We also returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nLet me make a few comments with respect to the Ukraine. We stopped all business in Ukraine as the war began, including our 2 plants in the country that produce products for both Ukraine and broader Europe. In total, this represents about $320 million in revenues on a yearly basis. As a result of this business stoppage, we expect asset write-offs and onetime costs of approximately $143 million, which will be excluded from our adjusted results. For the remainder of 2022, we expect about $200 million in revenue headwinds from the loss of revenue in Ukraine as well as losses related to finished goods that our Ukraine plant produce for other countries within Europe, where we do not have supply alternative yet. The lost revenue is expected to translate into $0.03 lower EPS.\nNow let me provide some color on our revised 2022 outlook on Slide 19. We now expect 4%-plus top line growth. This factors in the $200 million or roughly 1 point of negative impact currently anticipated from the Ukraine war, in addition to our expectations that we will return to more historical levels of elasticity later this year. We continue to expect pricing to be a larger driver of top line growth given its impact in Q1, and we are also announcing price increases across a number of markets for the rest of the year tied to inflation. We now expect input cost inflation in the low double-digit range for 2022 versus our prior view of approximately 8%, despite our coverage is approaching 90% for the year. The revised view of inflation reflects the war in the Ukraine and the related step-up in cost pressure to our commodity basket, including energy, wheat, oil and packaging.\nAs I said, we also expect additional pricing in a number of markets connected to this inflation, and these actions could cause an increase in elasticity versus what we are seeing today. As a result, we have planned accordingly. As we gave you guidance for 2022, we had some headroom. So we still feel we have an opportunity to hit high single-digit EPS. But the situation is very volatile. And given these dynamics, we believe it is prudent to call a range of EPS growth between mid-single to high single digit. This also factors in ongoing investment to support our brands and working media increases that, in some cases, might be increased, given good business momentum to protect versus elasticity driven by incremental price increases.\nOur outlook also now factors in $0.17 of headwind related to ForEx impact. $0.06 of this amount was included in our first quarter results. With respect to free cash flow, our view is unchanged as we continue to expect another year of $3 billion-plus.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by the Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nShep Dunlap\n\nVP of IR, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance.

We will close with Q&A. Before turning it over to Dirk, I would like to remind you of 2 upcoming investor events. First, we will present virtually on February 22 at CAGNY, focusing on our EMEA region; and second, please save the date for a Mondelez Investor Day on May 10.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dirk.\n\nDirk Van de Put\n\nChairman & CEO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shep, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I am starting off at Slide 4. 2021 marked another year of strong top and bottom line results. Growth was driven equally by volume and pricing as we leverage the strength of our brands and execution capabilities. We continued to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm, returning nearly $4 billion in capital to shareholders, while investing in our growth initiatives, positioning us well to deliver strong performance in 2022 and beyond.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact both consumer behavior and the broader operating environment. Against this backdrop, over the past 2 years, consumers continue to choose our trusted and beloved brands for both comfort and sustenance, at home and on the go. We have delivered on this strong underlying demand across our brands and geographies with continued strength in execution, activation and innovation. As a result, our cumulative market share remains higher than pre-COVID levels.\nAt the same time, we are continuing to operate in a dynamic environment, characterized by global input cost inflation alongside supply chain, labor and transportation disruption. We are effectively mitigating these challenges through ongoing cost discipline and strategic pricing actions. We also continue to execute well against our strategic growth priorities, investing in our brands, capabilities and sustainability initiatives while expanding our portfolio with the addition of several growth accretive acquisitions, Hu, Grenade, Gourmet Food and Chipita, which closed earlier this month. These additions increased our exposure to broader snacking categories and growing profit pools.\nAlong with our financial performance, we made progress in other areas. We continue to advance our ESG goals, setting ambitious new targets for achieving net zero by 2050, and we continue to accelerate our DEI agenda. And none of this would be possible without our people, the best in the CPG industry. We're proud of the way our teams continue to focus on delivering great products to our consumers as pandemic conditions continue to impact both our work lives and our personal lives.\nI am especially grateful to our frontline teams, whose hard work and dedication, delights families all over the world. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy and our continued investments position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2022 and beyond.\nLet's take a closer look at the market and macro trends on Slide 5. With the recent rise of the Omicron variant, the rebound in mobility that we saw earlier in 2021 has slowed down in both developed and emerging markets, and is expected to remain 10% to 15% below pre-COVID levels in many markets. Time at home and eating at home look likely to remain elevated. In the U.S., for example, 60% of adults are not expecting to eat out more in 2022 than they did in 2021. This positions our core biscuits and chocolate portfolios well as they are skewed towards in-home consumption.\nThe pandemic continues to fuel the desire for comfort and indulgence, benefiting our categories and trusted brands. And overall, as we found in our state of snacking survey released last week, the tendency for daily snacking is up for a third consecutive year. And although 70% of global consumers report concerns about inflation, it has done little to date to change their grocery shopping behavior. This is consistent with the observed price elasticity, which has been much lower than historical levels as well as a continued share weakness for private label.\nLet me spend a moment on the current operating environment on Slide 6. Like other companies, we are experiencing cost inflation globally, particularly on transportation costs, dairy, edible oils and packaging. We have implemented material price increases, ensures we are significantly hedged across key commodities, and we are continuing to drive productivity measures. We also continue to manage through significant volatility in the supply chain due to labor shortages at third parties as well as a continuing gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity in containers, in places like U.S. and the U.K.\nIn addition, the U.S. strike in Q3, although resolved, impacted our production output and inventory levels in the quarter. Additionally, COVID-19 continues to cause disruption in consumer mobility in certain geographies, impacting our gum business and on-the-go products. This currently affects a small portion of emerging markets. Additionally, the rise of the Omicron variant is driving high levels of absenteeism in certain markets, while limiting recovery mobility. We are focused on reactivating part of our COVID playbook from the early pandemic days and also looking to further simplify our operations to offset this pressure. And although challenging, we are managing effectively through each of these dynamics.\nWe implement our revenue growth management levers and continue to invest in our brands, while taking extensive measures to lighten the supply chain disruption. By applying the lessons learned from earlier waves of the pandemic and maintaining our focus on execution, we are confident that we remain well positioned to deliver our growth targets.\nTurning to Slide 7. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. Strong volume momentum, combined with brand investments and strategic pricing options, position us well to consistently deliver profitable top and bottom line growth as well as strong return of capital to our shareholders. We grew revenue by 5.2% in 2021, lapping 3.7% growth in 2020. Volume was once again a big contributor to this growth, which demonstrates the fundamental strength and health of our business.\nDespite the ongoing impact of cost inflation and supply chain volatility, we delivered gross profit growth of 3.6%. Our working media investments have increased double digit versus last year on the back of a double-digit increase in 2020. Combined with our advantaged portfolio of brands and our execution activation capabilities, we gained or held share across 75% of our revenue on a 2-year cumulative basis. We increased operating income by 5.8% and delivered $3.2 billion in free cash flow. We view these results as a healthy indicator of our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm.\nAs you can see on Slide 8, we are now averaging a 4.2% quarterly growth rate since the launch of our strategy in September 2018. We're proud of our strong and consistent track record over this time. We continue to focus on profit dollar growth, local first commercial execution, high return investments and aligned incentives, we are confident that we can continue to consistently deliver attractive growth.\nOn Slide 9, you can see some highlights of our successful execution against our long-term growth drivers. These include delivering our strongest Christmas sales on record in Europe, growing double digit versus 2020 and 2019, led by Cadbury in U.K. and Milka in Germany. It also includes continuing to expand distribution in emerging markets, adding 300,000 stores in China and more than 200,000 stores in India. It includes investing to sustain growth in digital commerce, which grew 29% on a reported basis, lapping 75% growth in 2020.\nDigital commerce now accounts for approximately 6% of revenue, up from 3% in 2019. And it also includes expanding our presence in high-growth segments where we are underrepresented, including well-being, where we launched breakthrough innovations on key brands like Oreo Zero Sugar in China as well as Cadbury Plant Bar and Plant Based Philadelphia in the U.K. As consumer demand for well-being options rises, each of these innovations has a clear potential to expand to additional geographies.\nWe also grew our presence in the premium biscuit space, with double-digit growth led by Tate's, which we successfully transitioned to direct store delivery. Additionally, we expanded our presence in close-in adjacencies, such as baked snacks with the successful integration of Give & Go. By realizing revenue and cost synergies, we grew that business double digit in 2021. We also expanded our presence in snack bars with the acquisition of Grenade in the U.K.\nSwitching to Slide 10. We continue to further enhance and strengthen our portfolio in 2021, expanding our exposure to the growing profit pools in chocolate and biscuits as well as adjacent categories and the well-being and premium segments. We acquired 4 high-growth strategic assets. Chipita baked snacks in Europe, which just closed in January; Grenade well-being snack bars in the U.K.; Gourmet Food premium crackers in Australia; and Hu premium well-being snacks in the U.S. These acquisitions are worth $800 million in annual revenue, and they are well positioned to collectively deliver high single-digit growth for years to come. This takes our total number of acquisitions to 7 since 2018 and contributing over $1.5 billion of revenue.\nWe also earned $1.5 billion in net proceeds from selling down on our beverage assets in [2021], enabling further investment in our brands and growth drivers. Additionally, we are in the process of completing a strategic review of our developed market gum business. We expect to complete that review and have more information to share with you at our May 10 Investor Day.\n2021 was a strong year, and we are well positioned for another year of strong shareholder returns in 2022 and beyond. By staying close to our consumers, executing our proven strategy and taking the appropriate actions to navigate input cost inflation and supply chain volatility, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come.\nWith that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials.\n\nLuca Zaramella\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our full year and fourth quarter performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, volume, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered revenue growth for the year and quarter of 5.2% and 5.4%, respectively. Importantly, half of this performance was underpinned by volume. Emerging markets increased 12% for the year and 11% for the quarter, with strong performance across significant majority of countries, especially the BRICS.\nDespite a small group of countries, specifically in Southeast Asia, continuing to face COVID-related challenges, overall, we are encouraged about the outlook for our EMs in the near and long term. Developed markets grew 1.6% for the year, coming off an exceptional 2020 and 2.5% for the quarter off a strong comparison. As with our emerging markets, we are encouraged by the sustained performance, particularly in our key (inaudible) categories.\nOn Slide 13, you can see our portfolio performance. Chocolate and biscuits remain attractive and durable categories with very strong results, both pre-pandemic during the pandemic and importantly as we enter 2022. In addition, improved mobility has yielded growth in gum and candy versus 2020, approaching a return to pre-pandemic levels in many markets and back to growth versus 2019 in China. Biscuits grew 3% for the year and 3.2% for the quarter. EMs were the big driver of performance, with majority of our EMEA and [LAA] business delivering double-digit or high single-digit growth. This underscores the large long-term opportunity for our EM biscuit businesses as we continue to make investments in A&C portfolio growth and distribution expansion.\nBoth global and local jewels brand, including Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Barni and Club Social delivered strong growth. Chocolate grew more than 10% for the year and 8% for the quarter. With significant growth across both developed and emerging markets through both our global and local brands, chocolate is a great category to be. And as in biscuits, we continue to make investments in our brands and capabilities to continue to drive its performance for the years to come. Gum & Candy posted 7% growth for the year and more than 11% growth for the quarter as increased mobility resulted in a return to growth in several key markets, especially within Latin America.\nNow let's review our market share performance on Slide 14. We continue to see good share performance on a 2-year cumulative basis, as we prioritize A&C investments and execute well in most markets. We held or gained share in approximately 75% of our revenue base on a 2-year stack. Our biscuits and chocolate categories continue to do well, with 80% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. Overall, share gains versus 2019 were broad-based, with all regions growing share over a 2-year period.\nA few of the more notable areas of share gains over this time include China, Russia, India, Brazil and Mexico biscuit; U.K., Russia and Australian chocolate; and China gum. As we move into Q1, we expect softer share performance, driven by our North American segment as the combination of supply chain constraints from third parties and labor shortages will pressure stocks and service levels.\nWhile the immediate effect of the strike is behind us, we have entered 2022 with low stocks, and we are working to rebuild inventory levels, which takes time in this environment, particularly as demand continues to be strong. We expect a gradual improvement of the situation as the year progresses.\nNow turning to Page 15. For the year, we delivered strong [OI] dollar growth of almost 6%, driven by solid gross profit dollar increases and reduced overheads. For the quarter, profitability was pressured primarily due to the lag between commodities and ForEx-related inflation and implementation of pricing actions, specifically in North America, where price increases became effective at the beginning of January.\nTurning to regional performance on Slide 16. Europe grew 5% for the year and 6.5% for the quarter, supported by strong execution and activation and continued recovery in the convenience away from home and travel retail channels. Our Q4 results were driven by some growth across major markets, including the U.K., Germany and Russia, underpinned by solid share gains. In chocolate, we delivered record results for the Christmas season, growing double digit against both 2020 and 2019. Biscuits and meals categories also delivered good results, while dollar growth for the year was high single digits driven by continued volume leverage, cost control and strong overhead management. Looking ahead in this region, we expect muted profitability in Q1, with improvement beginning in the second quarter as price increases in a number of countries take effect.\nNorth America declined by 0.6% for the year and 0.3% for Q4, lapping very strong high single-digit growth in the previous year. This performance includes healthy growth from our ventures portfolio, softening in the quarter and second half were also driven by supply chain constraints and low inventory levels due to the strike and third-party labor constraints. North America OI declined minus 10.4% for the year and minus 20% for the quarter due to inflationary pressure and supply chain constraints. As mentioned earlier, we expect sequential improvement as pricing actions go into effect in Q1.\nEMEA grew 7.3% for the year and 5.8% for the quarter, showing continued strength across most of the region. India grew double digits for the year and continues to execute well and reinvest for the future. We continue to extend our leadership position in chocolate, while the growth of our biscuit business continues to outpace larger competitors in the region.\nChina grew low double digit for the year and high single digits for the quarter, driven by continued share gains in both biscuits and gum. Australia and New Zealand also did well, with solid performances in the year and in the quarter in chocolate and biscuits. AMEA increased OI dollars by more than 13% for the year due to strong volume leverage, productivity and overhead management while also increasing working media by double digits. Q4 growth was more muted due to commodity inflation. As in other regions, pricing actions to RGM are being implemented as of Q1.\nLatin America turned in strong growth for the year of 20.4% and 19.7% for the quarter, with overall share gains for 2021. Brazil delivered strong double-digit growth for the year and quarter. Mexico grew high single digits for both the year and the quarter and our Western Andean business grew high single digits for the year and mid-teens for the quarter. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America increased high double digits for the year and more than 40% for the quarter. These increases were driven by broad-based growth across core snacking categories, effective pricing and the volume and mix impact of higher gum and candy. Inflationary pressure remains challenging, but we believe both our GM and volume growth will enable us to largely offset this dynamic in 2022.\nMoving to EPS. Full year EPS grew 9% at constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by top line driven operating gains.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3.2 billion, which included $300 million higher tax payments year-over-year, some related to our coffee JVs, IPOs and selldowns. We continue to feel confident about our free cash flow trajectory as we move forward. And for the year, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nNow let me provide some color on our 2022 outlook on Slide 20. We expect to deliver against our long-term growth algorithm that we see as a performance floor, particularly as revenue goes. As you are hearing across all sectors, we anticipate another year of material cost inflation, which in percentage terms is expected to increase high single digits versus 2021. As such, pricing will be a larger top line contributor than in the previous years, but we do expect volume growth to also be a positive factor.\nIn this regard, a few more points. Our superior portfolio of brands and the consistent investments we have made and will continue to make in working media, marketing and sales out-to-market and RGM capabilities position us well for sustained growth and profitability in this higher inflation environment. We believe we can continue being an effective driver of category value and volume growth specifically in biscuits and chocolate. Our focus is not changing as we aim at growing profit dollars and dollar growth underpins our sustainable algorithm, cash flow and capital return. We had a history of cost excellence, which we expect to remain the case for 2022 and going forward.\nOur algorithm continues to be predicated on brand building and capabilities in sales and marketing also in 2022. All included for the year, we expect mid-single-digit to high dollar growth and high single-digit EPS growth. Earnings phasing will reflect the current inflationary environment and the sequential introduction of pricing. We expect improved year-over-year gross profit dollar growth as pricing is fully realized and as we implement additional RGM strategies. But we do still expect some pressure in Q1 and partially in Q2.\nFor Q1 specifically, we still expect to face larger supply chain headwinds in North America related to third-party partners and low inventory from last year's strike that should improve as the year progresses. With respect to free cash flow, we expect another year of $3 billion plus. In this outlook, we also expect an ETR in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today. Interest expense of approximately $325 million and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

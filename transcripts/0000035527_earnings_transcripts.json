[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Curoe, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call.\nPlease review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 17, 2025, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them.\nFollowing prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. At Fifth Third, we believe that Great Bakes distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments or rather by how they navigate on certain ones. Our operating priorities are stability, profitability and growth in that order. We seek to achieve them by assessing over the detail on our day-to-day operations while simultaneously investing for the long term.\nAs you are aware, last week, we announced the merger of Fifth Third and Comerica. Our M&A framework has been consistent. First, that M&A is not a strategy unto itself, but rather a means to achieve stated strategic objectives. Second, that the cash earn back, IRR and NPV of synergies must be superior to organic alternatives to justify higher execution risk. And third, that the outcome must be a company that is better and not just bigger. We believe this is one of those rare combinations that satisfies all 3 criteria.\nFifth Third's stand-alone momentum in the revenue and expense synergies from Comerica should produce a well-diversified, even more profitable company with even better long-term growth.\nShifting to third quarter earnings. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 or $0.93, excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release. Reported and core results include the impact of nearly $200 million of provision expense associated with the fraud at Tricolor, which marred otherwise excellent quarter of operating results across NII, fees, expenses, and strategic growth. Average loans increased 6% year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter where year-over-year loan growth accelerated.\nAverage demand deposits were up 3% year-over-year, led by 6% consumer DDA growth. Adjusted revenues also rose 6%, underpinned by 7% improvement in net interest income and 5% growth in fees. Adjusted PPNR increased 11%, producing 330 basis points of positive operating leverage. Even with the impact of the large fraud, our profitability remains strong. On an adjusted basis, our ROA was 1.25%, our ROTCE was 17.7%, and our efficiency ratio was 54.1%.\nIn credit, commercial nonperforming assets declined 14% and criticized assets decreased 4%, to the lowest level in over 3 years. Lastly, tangible book value per share grew 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in a quarter in which we repurchased $300 million of stock and raised our common dividend by 8%.\nTurning to our growth strategies. Our investments in the Southeast and expanding our middle market sales force and in building high-growth recurring fee businesses continue to demonstrate strong results. We added 13 branches in the Southeast during the third quarter, including our first in Alabama, and we expect to open 27 more before the end of the year. Consumer households across the Southeast increased by 7% year-over-year more than 4x the rate of underlying market growth.\nOur deposit pricing remained disciplined with the total cost of retail deposits in the Southeast averaging 193 basis points in the quarter. We'll leverage the same proven de novo playbook, marketing tactics and differentiated digital offerings to drive retail deposit growth as we add 150 branches to Comerica's Texas footprint. Together, we'll have a presence in 17 of the fastest-growing large U.S. metro areas.\nIn our regions, our focus on middle market and wealth management is delivering new quality relationships, granular loan growth and recurring fees. In the third quarter, middle market RM headcount increased 8% year-over-year. New client acquisition increased 40% and average middle market loans increased 6%. In Wealth and Asset Management, advisor headcount rose 10% year-over-year, while fees climbed 11% and assets under management reached $77 billion in the quarter. Post close, we will rely on the same recruiting disciplines, investment capacity and one bank sales approach to help Comerica accelerate the growth of their crown jewel middle market franchise.\nIn our CIB verticals, Franchise Finance had another standout quarter. Over the past year, we have served as the lead arranger on 24 transactions totaling $3.9 billion, including 8 in the third quarter alone. Over the past 2 years, the Franchise Finance team has generated more than $40 million in annual commercial payments fees and $34 million in capital markets fees. We are excited to add Comerica's strong verticals to our existing expertise including in National Dealer Services, Environmental Services and Tech and Life Sciences, among others.\nIn commercial payments, fee growth reaccelerated to 3% sequentially in the third quarter. Newline increased revenue by 31% year-over-year and grew deposits by more than $1 billion. We expect Newline to sustain its growth as transactional activity ramps from the rollout of Strike Treasury and many other category definement payments customers who build on Newline's APIs. We're also seeing strong early activity from our acquisition of DTS Connect. Since the announcement, we have launched pilots with the most profitable quick service restaurant in the industry and the 1,200 location chain of convenience stores and also executed the first preordered branch change order at a major bank with over 2,000 branches.\nOn Direct Express, our merger with Comerica should simplify the transition for its 3.4 million program participants. We also anticipate additional growth opportunities stemming from the President's executive order, mandating the transition to electronic payments for all federal disbursements.\nLastly, we continue to deploy technology and lean manufacturing principles to produce savings and boost scalability. From our peak staffing level in early 2019, total headcount at Fifth Third is down 8%, while adjusted revenues are up 20%. The investments we've made will help us to efficiently scale the business and achieve our synergy targets as we integrate Comerica.\nBefore Bryan provides further detail on our outlook, I'd like to revisit the commitments we made at the beginning of the year, to deliver record NII regardless of the rate environment. and to produce 150 to 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the full year. We will deliver both. Looking to 2026 and beyond, there is so much to be excited about at Fifth Third. Among these, the tailwind from our investments in the Southeast, along with 60 additional branches to be opened next year, the sustained excellence of our J.D. Power award-winning digital experience and differentiated payments products, incredible new colleagues, geographies and capabilities at Comerica becoming part of our company.\nI'm grateful to all of the people whose hard work has put us in a position to take these steps. To the colleagues of both Fifth Third and Comerica, who will work so hard in the coming months to make our partnership a success and in particular, to our clients who entrust us with their well-being.\nWith that, Bryan will provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Third quarter results reflect disciplined execution of our strategic priorities. Expanding in the Southeast, scaling payments in Newline and maintaining operational efficiency while delivering strong performance in a rapidly changing environment. Adjusted revenue was $2.3 billion, our highest since 2022. NII grew 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially and net interest margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter.\nOur balance sheet continues to benefit from our balanced business mix through diversified loan origination platforms, fixed rate asset repricing tailwinds and broad funding sources supporting proactive liability management. Our fee businesses, led by wealth, commercial payments and capital markets, delivered adjusted growth of 5% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. This revenue performance, along with ongoing expense discipline, led to an 11% increase in pre-provision net revenue and 330 basis points of positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of last year.\nAs Tim mentioned, tangible book value per share, including the impact of AOCI, grew 3% from the second quarter despite only an 8 basis point decrease in the 10-year treasury rate, unrealized losses on our AFS portfolio improved 9% sequentially, underscoring the benefits of our bullet and locked-out securities. These positions provide certainty of cash flows and should continue to support tangible book value growth as they pull to par.\nNow diving further into the income statement and balance sheet performance. Net interest margin expanded 23 basis points over last year and 1 basis point sequentially. Year-over-year, average loans are up 6%, and excluding CRE categories, average balances are up 7%. Repricing benefits on fixed rate assets and disciplined management of liability costs continue to contribute to the strong NII performance. As Tim noted, relationship manager headcount is up 8%, and average middle market loans grew 6% over the last year. Third quarter middle market production rebounded sharply, up around 50% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.\nProduction levels are stable to improving in 11 of 14 regions, with the strongest performance in Central Ohio, Georgia, Texas and the Carolinas, Provide, our fintech lending platform, for Practice Finance continues to drive growth, with balances up nearly $1 billion over the last year. This growth in middle market C&I and Provide helps offset paydowns in our CIB and CRE portfolios, where average loan balances declined modestly as clients access bond and permanent financing markets during the quarter. This capital markets activity was a contributor to our strong fee performance during the quarter.\nProduction in our corporate banking verticals also rebounded this quarter, up 24% over 2Q. Pipelines for Middle Market and Corporate Banking remain strong heading into year-end. Commercial line utilization held steady throughout the quarter and ended in the mid-36% area. In total, end-of-period commercial loans are up 5% over last year. Consumer loans grew 2% on an average basis and 1% on a period-end basis from the prior quarter. We once again saw growth in nearly every major consumer lending category, led by continued strength in auto and home equity lending.\nShifting to deposits. Average core deposits increased 1% sequentially driven by DDA and money market growth. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew 1% sequentially and 3% over the prior year, led by consumer DDA growth of 6% as we continue to drive strong household growth through a de novo investment. Overall, consumer household growth remained strong at 3% over the last year, led by the 7% growth in the Southeast.\nProactive balance sheet management has allowed us to maintain our strong liquidity position while reducing our overall funding costs. We remain focused on granular insured deposits, growing average consumer and small business deposits by 1% sequentially. Consumer and payments linked deposit growth has given us the flexibility to manage down wholesale funding, which declined 3% sequentially. This favorable mix shift lowered the cost of interest-bearing liabilities by 1 basis point.\nOur Southeast de novo investments continue to deliver high-quality, low-cost retail deposits. Locations opened between 2022 and 2024 are significantly outperforming expectations with deposits per branch at month 12, averaging over $25 million, outpacing our model targets. And as Tim mentioned, our total cost of deposits in the Southeast is only 1.93%, generating 200-plus basis points of spread relative to Fed funds. We remain on track to open 50 branches this year, with 23 opened year-to-date. We have secured approximately 85% of the locations for the additional 200 Southeast branches that we announced last November. We ended the quarter with full category 1 LCR compliance at 126% and our loan-to-core deposit ratio was 75%, down 1% from the prior quarter.\nMoving on to fees. Adjusted noninterest income, excluding security gains and Visa swap impacts, grew 7% sequentially and 5% over the last year. Wealth fees rose by 11% over the last year on $8 billion of AUM growth and strong retail brokerage activity. Capital markets fees rebounded, up 28% sequentially and 4% over the last year driven by higher activity in loan syndications and M&A advisories. Commercial payment fees increased $5 million or 3% sequentially, including a $2 million negative impact from higher earnings credits on demand deposit growth. This fee performance was driven by core treasury management and Newline-related gross fees.\nNewline-related deposits hit $3.9 billion, up $1 billion from a year ago. The securities gains of $10 million were from the mark-to-market impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is offset in compensation expense.\nMoving to expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 3% compared to the year ago quarter and 2% sequentially, reflecting continued strategic investments in technology, branches and sales personnel. Even with the headcount additions associated with these investments, overall headcount was down 1% versus last year as our value stream programs continue to drive savings through automation and process redesign. By year-end, we anticipate $200 million of run rate -- annualized run rate savings associated with our value stream programs.\nShifting to credit. The net charge-off ratio was 109 basis points for the quarter, which includes $178 million in net charge-offs from Tricolor. NPAs declined 10% sequentially as expected and the NPA ratio decreased to 65 basis points. Broad-based credit trends remain stable across industries and geographies. Excluding Tricolor, commercial charge-offs were 51 basis points compared to 38 basis points in the prior quarter. This increase is due to the resolution of certain nonperforming loans for which specific reserves had been previously established.\nCommercial nonperforming loans decreased 14% sequentially and 30% since the first quarter. Consumer charge-offs were 52 basis points in the quarter, down 4 basis points, which is the lowest level over the last 2 years. The sequential decrease is primarily due to improvement in solar lending charge-offs which were down 39 basis points sequentially as expected. The broad consumer portfolio remains healthy with nonaccrual and over 90 delinquency rates stable or improving across loan categories.\nProvision expense included a $142 million reduction in our allowance for credit losses, reflecting improvement in Moody's macroeconomic scenarios and a reduction in specific reserves. Even with the scenario improvements, our baseline and downside cases assume unemployment reaching 4.8% and 8.4% in 2026, respectively. We made no changes to our scenario weightings during the quarter.\nACL as a percentage of our portfolio loans and leases decreased 13 basis points to 1.96%. The ACL as a percentage of nonperforming assets increased to 32% in due to the decrease in NPAs.\nMoving to capital. CET1 ended at 10.54% consistent with our near-term target of 10.5%. The pro forma CET1 ratio including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.8%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized losses as 62% of the fixed rate securities in our AFS portfolio are in bolder lockout structures which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations.\nMoving to our current outlook. We expect NII to be stable to up 1% from the third quarter due to loan and core deposit growth. This outlook assumes two 25 basis point rate cuts during the fourth quarter. We expect average total loan balances to be up 1% due to normal seasonal growth, strong C&I pipelines and continued broad-based momentum in consumer lending. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 2% to 3% due to seasonal strength in capital markets and continued commercial payments growth.\nFourth quarter adjusted noninterest expense is expected to be up 2% due to the opening of 27 financial centers in the Southeast and incentive compensation related to the growth in capital markets fees. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be up nearly 5% and PPNR to grow 7% to 8%.\nMoving to credit. Fourth quarter net charge-offs are expected to be around 40 basis points. Finally, turning to capital. We will be pausing share repurchases until the close of the Comerica acquisition, which is currently expected around the end of the first quarter of 2026.\nIn summary, we expect to maintain our momentum as we end the year and achieved record NII, positive operating leverage and strong returns in an uncertain environment, all while continuing to invest for the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A."

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Curoe, Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Curoe. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman and CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation.\nThese materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results. as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 17, 2025, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate on certain ones. In the period of tariff negotiations, cross currents and interest rates and significant regulatory change, Fifth Third continues to deliver excellent profitability, strong credit trends and accelerating revenue growth. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.88 or $0.90 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, exceeding consensus estimates.\nAdjusted revenues grew by 6% year-over-year led by 7% growth in NII. Adjusted PPNR increased 10%, and we delivered 250 basis points of positive operating leverage, our third consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage. Our key profitability metrics continue to be very strong and among the best of all peers who have reported thus far. Our adjusted return on assets was 1.2%, our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 18% and our efficiency ratio was 55.5%.\nOur credit metrics were strong and improved as we said they would. At 45 basis points, Net charge-offs were at the bottom of our guidance range and improved over the prior year. NPAs declined 11% sequentially, led by an 18% decline in commercial NPAs. Early-stage delinquencies declined again and are near historical lows. As a result of our strong financial performance and the positioning of our balance sheet, tangible book value per share increased by 18% over the prior year come by 5% sequentially.\nThe strategic investments we have made over the past several years drove our results in the quarter. In a quarter where even C&I loan demand and the soft housing market made loan growth tepid for the industry, our diversified loan origination platforms produced average loan growth of 5% over the prior year. We grew loans in C&I, CRE, leasing, mortgage, home equity, auto and both our Provide and dividend fintech platforms.\nInvestments we have made continue to support strong loan growth in future quarters. Commercial relationship manager headcount increased by 11% year-over-year, and Provide had record production in the first half of the year. In our home equity business, we were #2 market share in our footprint and first half production growth was third best in the country. Both Provide and home equity are examples of the benefits we have achieved from digitally enabled lending channels, combined with One Bank collaboration. Our investments in the Southeast also continue to produce strong results across business lines.\nOur Consumer Bank grew net new households by 6% over the prior year in the Southeast. The granular deposit growth those households provide has provided flexibility to continue to manage deposit costs even as the Fed paused on rate cuts. In the second quarter, our average cost of consumer and small business deposits in the Southeast was 191 basis points. a 250 basis points plus spread to Fed funds. We have added 10 branches year-to-date in the Southeast, and we'll open another 40 before year-end, bringing us to nearly 400 branches across all our Southeast markets.\nIn Commercial Banking, our Southeast regions have contributed more than half of total middle market loan growth over the past year, with North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama producing the strongest results. New middle market relationship production has also accelerated across the Southeast, where our teams have added 50% more new quality relationships year-to-date than they did over the same period last year.\nIn Wealth Management, our Southeast markets grew assets under management by 16% year-over-year to nearly $16 billion in total AUM. Adviser headcount is up about 15% in the same markets, which should support future growth. We also continue to see benefits from our investments in innovative tech-enabled products. In Consumer, J.D. Power recently recognized the Fifth Third mobile app as #1 in user satisfaction among regional banks. And we also launched an initiative to provide 3 wills to every Fifth Third customer through an exclusive partnership with Fintech Trust and well. We will begin to embed AI-enabled functionality into our mobile app in the second half of this year, which should further improve the user experience and reduce volumes and higher cost service channels.\nIn commercial payments, our investments in our new line embedded payments platform led to 30% revenue growth compared to last year and an increase of more than $1 billion in commercial deposits connected to new line services. We continue to win more business from existing clients and to see transaction migration from legacy ACH to modern instant payments risks. During the quarter, rippling selected New line to be their payments infrastructure provider, joining our existing roster of blue-chip fintech customers.\nIn my annual letter to shareholders this year, I reminded readers that the global economy is a complex adaptive system than the complex systems react to change in unexpected ways. These days, we are witnessing a lot of change in a short window of time. While we continue to be hopeful about the prospects for the second half of the year, we are also positioned to perform well in a broad range of environments. Our business mix is naturally resilient. Our balance sheet is defensively positioned and we have the flexibility to react quickly as conditions change. Bryan will provide more detail on our outlook, but I want to emphasize that we do not need a change in the interest rate environment or a material change in market activity to continue to produce strong profitability and organic growth.\nWe are raising our full year guidance on NII given the strong first half performance. We remain very confident in achieving record NII in 2025, even if there are 0 rate cuts for the remainder of the year. We will deliver 150 to 200 basis points of full year positive operating leverage even if the capital markets do not recover, given the strong first half performance and the expense levers we have at our disposal.\nWe will resume share repurchases in the third quarter. Our capital priorities continue to be funding organic growth paying a strong dividend and share repurchases in that order. Our operating priorities will also remain unchanged: stability, profitability and growth in that order.\nBefore I hand it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for your dedication to your clients. Your commitment to getting 1% better every day is why Fifth Third was recently recognized by USA TODAY as a top workplace and by Forbes as best employers for new graph, and I love being part of your team.\nWith that, Bryan will provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook for the second half of the year.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our second quarter results again reflected the strength and momentum of our company. On an adjusted basis, revenue increased 6% year-over-year and 5% on a sequential basis. Our stable and growing NII remains a strong contributor to our performance. We continue to realize the benefits of our diversified balance sheet and business mix through sustained loan growth, fixed rate asset repricing and the flexibility to execute proactive liability management.\nOur revenue performance, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, resulted in a 10% increase in pre-provision net revenue and 250 basis points of positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis compared to the second quarter of last year. Tangible book value per share, inclusive of the impact of AOCI, grew 18% from the prior year and 5% versus the first quarter. Our investment portfolio philosophy to focus on bullet and locked out securities in order to have certainty of cash flows continues to pay off. The unrealized loss in our AFS portfolio improved 6% sequentially and despite the 10-year treasury rate being a few basis points higher than the prior quarter end. The ACI burn down will continue to benefit tangible book value per share growth as these positions pulled a par. Now diving further into the income statement. Net interest income grew 7% from the prior year and 4% sequentially. Net interest margin expanded 9 basis points sequentially.\nThe broad-based loan growth, continued repricing benefits and deposit cost improvements all contributed to this performance. NII was also favorably impacted by the payoff of the nonperforming loan which contributed $14 million to NII and 3 basis points to NIM in the quarter. Excluding that payoff impact, NII still grew by 6% from the prior year and 3% sequentially. The which is at the high end of our guided range. This interest realization is an example of our proactive credit management, working with our clients to achieve loss minimization through the workout process.\nAs Tim highlighted, our diversified lending platforms continue to support strong balance sheet performance. Average portfolio loans grew 1% sequentially, while period-end loans were stable despite a decrease in commercial utilization. Consumer loans were up 3% on a period-end basis and 2% on an average basis from the prior quarter. On a period-end basis, we saw growth in every major consumer lending category, led by continued strength in our secured lending products, such as auto and home equity lending.\nCommercial loans increased 1% on an average basis and declined 1% on a period-end basis. As I highlighted in early June, Line utilization peaked around April month end at 37.5%. Post-April, we have seen a gradual decrease to 36.5% as of June 30. Approximately 40% of the decrease in line utilization was driven by growth and commitments. In addition to the utilization trend, period-end loans were impacted by a $400 million sequential decrease in commercial construction balances as projects were refinanced into the permanent market. Economic uncertainty impacted client confidence and resulted in the lowest quarter of commercial loan production over the last year.\nThere were some bright spots with continued strong production in Chicago, the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama. While utilization has impacted balances, commitments continue to grow. Middle market pipelines have also rebounded during the quarter as our third quarter pipeline is up almost 50% from the prior quarter.\nShifting to deposits. Average core deposits were stable sequentially and as an increase in demand deposits was largely offset by a decrease in interest checking. Our strong liquidity profile continues to provide us with the flexibility to actively manage our overall funding costs while executing tactics to grow granular insured deposits. As a result of these efforts, interest-bearing deposit costs were down 3 basis points sequentially and 65 basis points over the last year while we have continued to grow consumer and small business deposits, which are up 1% versus the prior year.\nCompared to the first quarter, demand deposit balances were up 3% on an average and end-of-period basis, this strong core deposit performance has allowed us to pay down over $4 billion of higher cost nonrelationship broker time deposits over the last 2 years.\nWe will continue to prioritize high-quality, low-cost retail deposits, particularly in the Southeast with our de novo investments. The most recent vintages of de novos are significantly outperforming expectations. Branches built between 2022 and 2024 are averaging over $25 million in deposit balances within the first 12 months after opening, significantly outpacing our original expectations. We remain on pace to open 50 branches this year with 10 opened in the first half.\nWe have now secured approximately 80% of the locations for the additional 200 Southeast branches that we announced in November of last year. Our deposit success, along with investment portfolio positioning has allowed us to maintain strong balance sheet liquidity while growing loans and managing deposit costs. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 120% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 76%, up 1% from the prior quarter.\nMoving on to fees. Reported noninterest income was up 8% year-over-year. These results were impacted by security gains and the impact of certain items detailed on Page 4 of the release. Excluding the impact of the security gains and the other items, adjusted noninterest income for the quarter increased 3% compared to the same quarter last year, led by growth in wealth fees, which grew 4% over the prior year due to AUM growth of $8 billion and consumer banking fees, which were up 6%.\nCommercial payment fees decreased $2 million due to lower commercial card spend activity and higher earnings credits from increased demand deposit balances offsetting the increase in gross fee equivalent. Our embedded payments business, New line continued its strong growth with fees up 30%. Deposits attached to new line services increased to $3.7 billion, up $1.1 billion compared to a year ago period.\nCapital markets fees were down 3% from the prior year, primarily due to the continued slowdown in M&A advisory revenue. Bond underwriting and loan syndication activity was strong during June, and client appetite for transactional activity during stable market periods remains robust. The security gains of $16 million were from the mark-to-market impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is offset in compensation expense.\nMoving to expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense was up 4% compared to the year ago quarter and decreased 4% sequentially. The sequential comparison is impacted by seasonal items in the first quarter associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. The previously mentioned deferred compensation mark-to-market increased expenses by $16 million for the quarter. Excluding the impact of the deferred comp mark-to-market in the quarter and in prior periods, expenses were down 5% sequentially and and increased 3% compared to the prior year.\nThe year-over-year increase in expense is due to continued investments in technology, branches and sales personnel partially being offset by the ongoing savings generated by our value stream efficiency programs.\nShifting to credit. The net charge-off ratio was 45 basis points at the lower end of our expectations for the quarter and down 1 basis point sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 38 basis points, up 3 basis points sequentially and Consumer charge-offs were 56 basis points, down 7 basis points, primarily due to seasonal improvement in credit performance in auto and credit card. Our NPAs declined 11% sequentially, as expected, led by an 18% decrease in commercial nonperformers. The NPA ratio decreased 9 basis points sequentially to 72 basis points. Broad-based credit trends remain stable across industries and geographies despite the market and economic volatility.\nOur provision expense for the quarter included a $34 million build in our allowance for credit losses. This build was primarily attributable to the deterioration in the Moody's macroeconomic scenarios, which now project a 0.5% increase in their baseline unemployment rate projection, which is up to 4.7% by 2027. The scenario-driven increases were partially offset by improvement in the overall risk profile of the portfolio, as indicated by the reduction in NPA. This increase in reserve build was slightly less than we expected in early June as utilization trends and commercial construction paydowns impacted period-end loan balances.\nThe reserve build increased our ACL coverage ratio by 2 basis points to 2.09%. We made no changes to our scenario weightings during the quarter.\nMoving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, an increase of 13 basis points and consistent with our near-term target of 10.5%. Our pro forma CET1 ratio including the AOCI impact of securities is 8.6%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We anticipate continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio given that approximately 63% of the fixed rate securities in our AFS portfolio are in bullet or locked out structures, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations.\nMoving to our current outlook. With the continued momentum from the second quarter, we remain confident in our ability to achieve record NII and full year positive operating leverage approaching 2%. We now expect full year NII to increase to 5.5% to 6.5%, up from our earlier guide. This outlook uses the forward curve at the start of July, which assumes 25 basis point rate cuts in September, October and December.\nDue to the resiliency of our balance sheet, we expect to achieve record NII and our updated full year guide with no further loan growth and no rate cuts. Full year average total loans are expected to be up 5% compared to 2024, with the increase primarily driven by C&I and auto lending production. Our cash position, securities portfolio and commercial line utilization should remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2025.\nFull year adjusted noninterest income is expected to be up 1% to 2% as the muted capital market trends are offset by continued growth in other fee categories. We now expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up 2% to 2.5% compared to 2024. We will continue to execute our growth plans with Southeast branch builds and sales force additions in middle market, commercial payments and wealth. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be up 4% to 4.5% and PPNR to grow around 7%.\nMoving to credit. We are tightening the range for full year net charge-offs to 43 to 47 basis points. The timing of charge-offs for individual credits may impact a particular quarter, but the midpoint of our full year expectations remains consistent with our beginning of the year guide.\nMoving to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect NII to be up 1% from the second quarter due to the benefits from fixed rate asset repricing and day count. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% due to strengthening C&I pipelines and continued broad-based momentum in consumer loans. Excluding the impact of the security gains, we expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 4%.\nThird quarter adjusted noninterest expense is expected to be up 1% compared to the second quarter as we continue to invest. We expect third quarter charge-offs to again be in the 45 to 49 basis point range.\nTurning to capital. We will continue to target our CET1 ratio at 10.5%. Based on our current projections for balance sheet growth, we expect to repurchase $400 million to $500 million of stock during the remainder of 2025. We continue to prioritize organic loan growth over share repurchases in order to deliver the best long-term returns for our shareholders.\nIn summary, we expect to maintain our momentum in the second half of the year and achieve record NII, positive operating leverage and strong returns in an uncertain environment, all while continuing to invest for the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nThanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. And then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A."

My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2025 Fifth Third Bancorp Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].\nAfter the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Curoe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of April 17, 2025, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. .\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe -- great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they navigate benign environments, but rather by how they navigate on certain ones. I say this at the start of every investor communication, but it is particularly relevant today. I'm very pleased with our performance this past quarter and confident that we are positioned to deliver stability, profitability and growth in that order in the many potential scenarios that could play out over the remainder of the year.\nThis morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.71 or $0.73 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, exceeding consensus estimates. We grew PPNR by 5% year-over-year and achieved an adjusted return on equity of 11.2%. We grew tangible book value per share 15% over the prior year despite the 10-year treasury rate being unchanged. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our return on assets, return on equity and efficiency ratio remain among the best of our peers. In the quarter, we sustained our positive momentum on loan growth, net interest margins, net charge-off rate and operating leverage.\nTotal loans grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong middle market C&I production, a pickup in leasing activity and balanced growth across consumer secured lending categories. Our charge-off rate was stable following sequential improvement over the second half of last year. Core deposits were stable, even with our continued progress on deposit costs, supported by 2% total household growth and 5% growth in the Southeast. NII grew faster than our balance sheet grew at 4% over the prior year as net interest margins expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter. despite market-related impacts to our capital markets business, adjusted fees, excluding securities gains and losses, were up 1% versus the prior year. Commercial Payments grew 6%, driven by new line in our managed services offerings and Wealth and Asset Management revenue grew 7%, supported by 10% growth in AUM.\nContinued progress on our value streams and disciplined expense management held expenses [indiscernible] the prior year. and we again delivered positive operating leverage. We are pleased that our first quarter results reflected the strength of our franchise. But today, we are focused on what is in front of us as opposed to what is behind. In my annual letter to shareholders in February, I wrote that the global economy is a complex adaptive system and the complex systems react to change in unexpected ways. Despite our best efforts to understand the implications Today, we cannot predict what the final tariff policies will look like, much less with the second order effects on economic activity, fiscal policy and monetary policy will be.\nWhat we [ need ] to do is to ensure that our business mix is more naturally resilient run our balance sheet defensively, and retain optionality so that we can react quickly as conditions change. If C&I loan demand softens in the second half of the year, we have more avenues than most to manage our balance sheet. Our diverse national and origination platforms give us flexibility on how to generate loan growth. And our multiyear investments in Southeast branches and growth in commercial payments will continue to produce granular operational deposit funding. We believe credit concentration limits boost resiliency and the quality of client selection. And as a result, we are well diversified across asset classes, industries and regions. We are clear-eyed about risks when they emerge and have been consistent about moving proactively to ensure charge-offs are well reserved before they materialize.\nAt 2.7% and ACL coverage ratio is among the highest of all our peers. On fee income, our focus on diversification and recurring versus transactional revenue sources should help to mitigate the potential for continued capital markets disruption. 5 different fee categories each contributed more than 10% of total fee income in the first quarter. Finally, we manage our business day to day in a fashion that maximizes optionality. We've done multiple paths to achieving our revenue targets model a broad range of scenarios, including low growth, stagflation and recession scenarios and where options to deliver sustainable profitability.\nWe always plan to keep a tight lid on expenses because it is easier to invest more in the stronger-than-expected environment than it is to cut in a weaker-than-expected environment. Bryan will provide more detail on our outlook for the remainder of the year, but I would like to have a few points. First, we expect to achieve record NII within our existing guidance rates even if there are no rate cuts and no further loan growth. Second, we can deliver full year positive operating leverage even if the capital markets do not recover, given the expense levers we have at our disposal. Third, if the forward curve is realized, we expect to grow tangible book value per share by 10% for the full year from AOCI accretion alone, in addition to the growth we will generate from earnings. Last, our capital priorities continue to be funding organic growth, paying a strong dividend and share repurchases in that order.\nBefore I hand it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for all you do and for your dedication to our clients. Your commitment to getting 1% better every day is the reason Fifth Third was recently recognized by Aptosphere as 1 of the world's most ethical companies by Fortune as 1 of America's most innovative companies. by Euromoney as the best U.S. private bank and by J.D. Power as #1 in retail customer satisfaction in Florida for the second consecutive year. I love being part of your team. With that, Bryan will provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results demonstrated the ongoing strength and momentum of our company. Adjusted revenue increased 3% year-over-year as our well-positioned balance sheet led to continued margin expansion driven by robust loan growth, continued fixed rate asset repricing and proactive liability management. The revenue performance, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, resulted in a 5% increase in pre-provision net revenue and 175 basis points of positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis compared to the first quarter of last year.\nOur core deposit funded balance sheet and diversified revenue sources provide us with flexibility and resiliency to deliver stable for the cycle results. Our strong profitability allowed us to maintain our CET1 ratio at 10.5%, consistent with our near-term target while growing our period-end loans by $2.4 billion. executing a $225 million share repurchase and absorbing the 7 basis point impact from the final CECL phase-in. As Tim mentioned, the tangible book value per share, inclusive of the impact of AOCI, grew 15% from the prior year despite the 10-year treasury rate being effectively unchanged.\nThe strategy in our investment portfolio to focus on investments with known cash flows through bullet and locked out securities will continue to contribute to tangible book value per share growth as these positions [indiscernible] . Net interest income continued its positive momentum with NII flat sequentially despite 2 fewer days in the quarter and net interest margin expanded by 6 basis points. Proactive balance sheet management resulted in a 20 basis point reduction and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities sequentially. These actions, along with the continued loan growth and the repricing benefit on fixed rate assets more than offset the decrease in yield on our floating rate assets.\nLoan growth also continued positive momentum in the first quarter. Average loans increased by 3%, the largest sequential growth in nearly 3 years and period-end loan growth grew by 2%. The Commercial loans grew 3% on a period-end basis and 4% on an average basis compared to the fourth quarter, driven by continued strength in production and middle market lending across our regions, led by Western Michigan, Georgia and Cincinnati. Utilization improved by about 1 point to 37% sequentially. Utilization has continued to increase slowly during the first half of April. Consumer loans were up 1% on a period-end basis and 2% on an average basis from the prior quarter, led by continued strength in secured lending products such as auto and home equity lending.\nShifting to deposits. Average core deposits decreased 2% sequentially, driven primarily [indiscernible] seasonality in commercial. Our strong liquidity profile continues to provide us the flexibility to actively manage our overall funding costs. Interest-bearing core deposit costs were 2.39% in the first quarter, down 25 basis points from the fourth quarter representing a core deposit beta in the low 60s. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits improved slightly to 25% during the quarter. Demand balances were down 1% on an average basis and flat on a period-end basis compared to the prior quarter.\nWe believe this balance level will be relatively stable over the near term. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 127% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 75%, up 2% from the prior quarter. Our focus remains on prudently managing total funding costs while maintaining a strong liquidity position. Our investments in Southeast branches will add momentum in gathering low-cost, stable retail deposits. This approach will continue to provide us with the flexibility needed to manage uncertainty and to deliver a record 2025 NII despite the volatile environment.\nMoving on to fees. Highlighted on Page 2 of our release, our reported results were impacted by the valuation of the Visa total return swap. Excluding the impacts of the swap and securities gains and losses, adjusted noninterest income for the first quarter increased 1% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by growth in wealth and commercial payments. In wealth, fees grew 7% over the prior year to $172 million due to $6 billion of AUM growth and increased transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities. Commercial payments increased 6% year-over-year to $153 million, driven by net fee equivalent growth, which was up 8%.\nManaged services and new line provided over half of this growth. Capital markets fees declined by 7% from the year ago period, primarily due to a slowdown in loan syndications and M&A advisory revenue given the increased volatility and economic uncertainty. -- the securities losses of $9 million included a loss of $4 million from the mark-to-market impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is offset in compensation expense. Moving to expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense was flat compared to the year ago quarter and increased 7% sequentially, slightly below our prior expectations. As is always the case in the first quarter, -- the sequential comparison is impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and timing of payroll taxes.\nThe previously mentioned deferred compensation mark-to-market reduced expenses by $4 million for the quarter compared to a $7 million benefit in the prior quarter and an $11 million increase to expenses in the year ago quarter. Excluding the impact of the deferred comp mark-to-market, Year-over-year expenses increased 1% as revenue-related compensation expense and ongoing savings generated by our value stream efficiency programs offset our continued investments in technology, branches and sales personnel.\nShifting to credit. The net charge-off ratio was 46 basis points at the lower end of our expectations for the quarter and flat sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 35 basis points, up 3 basis points sequentially. The Consumer charge-offs were 63 basis points, down 5 basis points, primarily due to seasonal improvement in credit performance in auto. Our NPA ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially to 81 basis points primarily driven by 2 ABL credits in our C&I portfolio. The CRE portfolio continues to perform well with total CRE NPAs declining from 46 basis points to 38 basis points. including only 7 basis points of NPA in our nonowner-occupied portfolio. In solar lending, our NPAs decreased by over 50% primarily due to our work to support customers where installers have gone out of business.\nFor these borrowers, we assisted them in getting their solar installation projects completed, and these loans are now current with sustained payment history. For the second quarter in a row, commercial criticized assets decreased with the $20 million reduction bringing criticized levels to their lowest level in the past 5 quarters. Additionally, Early-stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due increased just 6 basis points and remained near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. Our portfolio remains diversified across industries and geographies. Despite some increases in NPAs, given the impact of the rate environment and economic uncertainty, -- we have not seen broad-based weakening trends in individual industries or geographies.\nOur provision expense for the quarter resulted in a $38 million build in our allowance for credit losses. This build was primarily attributable to continued growth in period-end loans and a deterioration in Moody's macroeconomic scenarios. These increases were partially offset by improvement in the overall risk profile of the portfolio as indicated by the reduction in criticized assets and the previously mentioned reduction in NPAs in our solar lending portfolio. Our ACL coverage ratio was 2.07% and down 1 basis point sequentially. We made no changes to our scenario weightings during the quarter.\nMoving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.5%, and exceeding our buffered minimum of 7.7% and consistent with our near-term target. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.3% up 52 basis points year-over-year. We anticipate continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, given that approximately 63% of the fixed rate securities in our AFS portfolio, are in bullet or lockout structures, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations.\nAs Tim said, assuming the forward curve is realized, tangible book value per share should grow by about 10% for the full year before considering any future earnings as the AOCI related to the securities losses will accrue back into equity. During the quarter, our $225 million share repurchase reduced our share count by 5.2 million shares. Moving to our current outlook. Despite the uncertain environment, we remain confident in our ability to achieve record NII and full year positive operating leverage. We expect full year NII to increase 5% to 6% and consistent with our guide in January. The outlook uses the forward curve at the start of April, which assumes a 25 basis point rate cuts in June, September and December. Due to the resiliency of our balance sheet, we would expect to achieve record NII and achieve our full year guide with no further loan growth and no interest rate cuts.\nGiven our quarter-end loan balances, we now expect full year average total loans to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2024, with the increase primarily driven by loan production and line utilization in C&I combined with the continued growth in auto loans. We are assuming that the cash position, securities portfolio and commercial revolver utilization all remain relatively stable through the remainder of 2025. Full year adjusted noninterest income is expected to be up 1% to 3% as continued economic uncertainty has slowed down capital markets activity.\nWealth and Asset Management revenues are also impacted by the recent sell-off in equities. Commercial payments revenue is growing as expected and its technology-led product offerings continue to ramp from growth and new relationships. As a result of lower customer activity, we expect to manage full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up just 2% to 3% compared to 2024. We -- our expense outlook assumes no change to the accelerated branch openings in the high-growth Southeast markets and continuing Salesforce additions in middle market, commercial payments and wealth to increase our production capacity to support our strategic growth objectives. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be up 4% to 5% and PPNR to grow in the 6% to 7% range. and positive operating leverage of 150 to 200 basis points.\nMoving to credit. We still expect 2025 net charge-offs to be in the 40 to 49 basis point range. The timing of charge-offs for individual credits may impact a particular quarter, but our full year expectations remain consistent with our January guide. Given economic uncertainty and volatility in projected economic scenarios, we will no longer be guiding on provision bills. Moving to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect NII to be up 2% to 3% from the first quarter due to the benefits of loan growth, fixed rate asset repricing, day count and the continued management of interest-bearing liabilities costs. We expect average total loan balances to increase 1% due to the full quarter impact of the C&I production in the first quarter and continued momentum in auto.\nExcluding the impact of securities losses, we expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 2% to 6% sequentially. The wider range is due to increased economic uncertainty impacting wealth and capital markets revenue. We expect strength in Consumer Banking due to seasonally higher card spend. Second quarter adjusted noninterest expense is expected to be down 5% compared to the first quarter due to the seasonal impact from the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes in the first quarter. We expect continued investments in technology and marketing. We expect second quarter charge-offs to again be in the 45 to 49 basis point range.\nFinally, we continue to believe granular organic loan growth represents the best use of capital to generate strong returns for our shareholders. Based on our current projected balance sheet growth, we expect to repurchase $400 million to $500 million of stock during the remainder of 2025, likely in the second half of the year. We will continue to target our CET1 ratio at 10.5% and the ultimate amount and timing of future share repurchases will be dependent on realized loan growth.\nIn summary, with our resilient balance sheet, diversified revenue streams and disciplined expense and credit risk management, we expect 2025 to achieve record NII, positive operating leverage and strong returns for our shareholders as we continue to invest for the long term. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nThanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Curoe, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Brian Preston, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call.\nPlease review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 21, 2025, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Brian, we will open up the call for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate on certain ones. We achieved this through a diversified business mix, defensive balance sheet positioning and by obsessing over the details in day-to-day operations while investing for the long term.\nThis morning, we reported earnings per share or $0.90 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, including the guidance we provided in our third quarter earnings call. We achieved an adjusted return on equity of 13.7%, the highest among all peers who have reported thus far.\nRevenues for the quarter grew 2% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Core adjusted PPNR exceeded $1 billion for the first time in several quarters, and our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 54.7%.\nThe fourth quarter capped the year was the industry outlook for interest rates, loan growth, regulation and capital markets activity all changed significantly. Despite this, we delivered strong and predictable results. Our full year return on assets of 1.17% return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, of 14%, an efficiency ratio of 57.1%, all finished among the top in our peer group.\nWe were 1 of only a few banks to achieve full year guidance for NII, fees, expenses, PPNR and net charge-offs that was provided back in January. Our NIM inflected in the first quarter as we said it would. NII inflected in the second quarter as we said it would. We returned to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, as we said we would. We resumed share repurchases in the second quarter and raised our dividend in the third quarter. In total for the year, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, while also increasing our CET1 ratio by more than 20 basis points.\nCompetitive barriers are exceedingly difficult to build in the banking business. The only way we know how to build them is to invest continuously in a limited number of strategies over a sustained period of time. Our growth strategies are well known and have been consistent for several years now. Their impact is evidenced in our 2024 results and reflected in the third-party accolades that we received during the year.\nOur investments to expand our Southeast branch footprint and in our differentiated momentum banking platform continue to drive outsized growth in granular low-cost deposits. For the second consecutive year, Fifth Third was #1 among all large banks and year-over-year retail deposit growth measured on a cap deposit basis.\nWe generated year-over-year household growth of 2.3% and punctuated by 6% growth in the Southeast, and we also won J.D. Power's Retail Banking Satisfaction award for the Florida region. The 31 de novo branch locations we opened in 2024 and the 60 new branches we expect to open in the Southeast in 2025, should set us up well to continue to gain market share.\nOn lending, our investments to generate granular diversified loan originations without compromising on pricing or risk gaining momentum throughout the year and contributed to a strong finish. On a sequential end-of-period basis, we grew loans 3% or a bit more than 1% faster than the HA. Growth was balanced between consumer and commercial and across product categories, including from our through-the-cycle commitment to the auto business, strong C&I production from the middle market and key CIB verticals and continued growth from providing dividends in tech platforms.\nIn the middle market, we expanded our relationship manager head count by 25% in the Southeast and [indiscernible] our expansion markets over the course of 2024. Fourth quarter middle market loan production reached a 3-year high, increasing over 50% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year, and we also saw a modest uptick in utilization.\nOur C&I pipelines in middle market are at record levels heading into 2025, and we expect to add another 5% to 10% to RM head count over the course of the year. On fees, our commercial payments business grew fee revenues by 8% in 2024, and we processed $17 trillion in volume. Our managed services offerings and Newline led the way on growth and nearly 40% of all new commercial payments relationships have no credit attached. In addition, Care sheet, Global Finance and this week and Fintech all recognize new line with awards for technology innovation. The ramp from new and expanded relationships won during the year, including Stripe and Trustee, will give us a head start on the strong 2025.\nIn Wealth and Asset Management, total assets under management grew 17% year-over-year, up roughly $10 billion to $69 billion in total AUM. Our Fifth Third Private Bank, Fifth Third Securities and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors business units all delivered strong performance, and we were recognized for the sixth consecutive year as Best Private Bank by Global Finance.\nLast, we continued to make good progress on modernizing our operating platform. We completed general ledger and clearing platform conversions during the year and launched term deposits on a modern cloud core. Our cross-functional lean value streams have achieved more than $150 million in annualized savings and head count declined 1% year-over-year. These initiatives continue to improve execution quality and provide funding for the investments in our growth strategies.\nLooking ahead to 2025, there are many reasons to feel optimistic about the banking sector. The underlying economy is solid and most business owners are more optimistic about 2025 than they were about 2024. The combination of front-end rates above 0 and some steepness in the yield curve is a more constructive setup than we have had in quite some time.\nWe may also be on the cusp of a shift in the direction and regulation, which could unlock new opportunities. With that said, recent history is a good reminder that things can shift very quickly. The modern economy is the most complex adaptive system the world has ever seen, and complex systems react to change in unexpected ways.\nSomewhat well, we are pleased with the positioning of our company. We remain confident in achieving record NII in 2025 and delivering full year positive operating leverage across a range of interest rate environments. Our credit portfolio remains well diversified and proactively managed and the risks are well understood. We will continue to focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order and to stay balanced in our positioning, while investing with the long term in mind.\nBefore I turn it over to Brian, I want to say thank you to our employees for the way you support our customers and our communities and for your commitment to getting 1% better every day. You make our company the special place it is.\nWith that, Brian will provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook for 2025.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated the ongoing strength and momentum of our company. With a resilient balance sheet and diversified income streams, we achieved 3% sequential growth in adjusted revenue. That revenue performance, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, resulted in a 5% sequential pre-provision net revenue increase in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis.\nAs Tim mentioned, our strong profitability allowed us to return over $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2024, including the $300 million share repurchase executed in the fourth quarter. We delivered $3 billion of sequential growth in end-of-period loans and maintained our CET1 ratio consistent with our near-term operating target of 10.5%.\nIn addition to the $630 million in stock we were purchased in 2024, our tangible book value per share, inclusive of the impact of AOCI increased 6% from the previous year despite the 10-year treasury increasing nearly 70 basis points. The strategy in our investment portfolio to focus on investments with known cash flows through the bullet and locked out securities will continue to benefit us as these positions pull to par. Even with the increase in rates, the securities we maintained and available for sale realized an improvement in their unrealized loss position since the end of last year.\nHighlighted on Page 2 of our release, our reported results were impacted by certain items. These include costs related to the Visa-MasterCard interchange litigation and a contribution to our foundation, partially offset by benefits related to an updated estimate for the FDIC special assessment and the resolution of a prior period state tax item.\nNet interest income for the quarter continued its positive momentum, increasing 1% sequentially to $1.4 billion with net interest margin improving 7 basis points. Proactive balance sheet management resulted in a 35 basis point reduction in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. These actions, along with the loan growth and the continued repricing benefit on fixed rate assets more than offset the decrease in yield on our floating rate assets.\nLoan growth accelerated in December, resulting in a strong period end loan growth of 3%, with average loans increasing 1% sequentially. Period-end commercial loans were up 3%, and average balances were relatively stable. We saw broad-based strength in production across our middle market footprint, led by our Chicago, Indiana, Carolinas and Georgia regions, as well as a rebound in our corporate banking verticals. Utilization improved the point, some of which we expect as normal year-end seasonality.\nAverage and period-end consumer loans were up 2% from the prior quarter, reflecting increases in indirect auto and residential mortgages. Both asset classes also saw sequential increases in yield due to the continued front book back book repricing benefits on these fixed rate portfolios.\nShifting to deposits. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher interest checking balances in commercial. This core deposit performance, combined with the flexibility provided by our elevated cash position, allowed us to meet our expected down rate beta targets and further reduce higher-cost short-term wholesale borrowings. Interest-bearing core deposits peaked at 2.9% in August, and were down to 2.49% in the month of December, representing a core deposit beta in the upper 50s.\nTotal core deposits have increased by $1.6 billion over that same horizon. As always, our focus remains on prudently managing total funding costs while maintaining a strong liquidity position. We are very pleased with the 38 basis point sequential decrease in interest-bearing liability costs. Our balanced approach will continue to provide us with flexibility need to continue our NII growth trajectory to a record 2025, as we head into another uncertain rate environment.\nDemand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits remained at 24% during the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Balances were stable on both an end-of-period and average basis compared to the third quarter. We believe this balance level will be maintained as short-term rates are likely to be relatively stable over the near term. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 125% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 73%, up 2% from the prior quarter.\nMoving to fees. During the fourth quarter, we updated the noninterest income captions on our income statement to better align disclosures to our most significant business activities, which includes the addition of commercial payments and capital markets line items. The appendix of our presentation provides more detail on the caption changes. Excluding the impacts of the securities gains and losses and the Visa total return swap, adjusted noninterest income in the fourth quarter increased 5% compared to the same quarter last year.\nCapital markets, wealth and commercial payments all delivered strong fee results, driven by our sustained strategic growth investments in products and sales personnel. Capital Markets grew 16% over the prior year, with increases in loan syndications, debt capital markets and M&A advisory revenue. We continue to see activity below prior year levels in our customer hedging and institutional brokerage fees.\nIn wealth, fees grew 11% over the prior year to $163 million due to AUM growth and increased transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities. The new commercial pay caption includes TAM fees and earnings credits that were previously included in service charges on deposits, and commercial card and sponsorship revenue that was previously reported in card and processing revenue.\nCompared to the prior year, commercial payments revenue increased 7%, driven by treasury management net fee equivalent growth, which was up 11%. We continue to acquire new clients and treasury management products in our managed services and in new line.\nThe securities losses of $8 million were primarily from the mark-to-market impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is offset in compensation expense. Moving to expenses. Excluding the items noted on Page 2 of our release, our adjusted noninterest expense was up 1% from the year ago quarter and decreased 1% sequentially. The previously mentioned deferred compensation mark reduced expenses by $7 million for the quarter compared to expense increases of $10 million and $13 million in the prior and year ago quarters, respectively.\nExcluding the impact of the deferred comp mark, Year-over-year expense growth was 2% and sequential expense growth was 1%. While investments in technology, branches and sales personnel have and will continue to drive expense increases, these costs continue to be partially funded through the savings generated by our value stream efficiency programs.\nShifting to credit. The net charge-off ratio was 46 basis points in line with our expectations for the quarter and down 2 basis points sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 32 basis points, down 8 basis points. Consumer charge-offs were up 6 basis points, which primarily reflects the normal seasonal fourth quarter uptick we see in our indirect auto and card portfolios as well as the continued seasoning of the 2022 vintages in our solar and RV portfolios. Consistent with broader industry data, the 2022 consumer vintage appears to be a modest underperformer relative to other origination periods.\nEarly stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due, increased only 1 basis point and remained near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. Our NPA ratio increased 9 basis points [indiscernible] to 71 basis points. Commercial NPAs contributed $122 million to the increase from the prior quarter and consumer NPAs were up only $15 million.\nWithin Commercial, our CRE portfolio continues to perform well with no net charge-offs during the quarter and a stable NPA ratio of 46 basis points. Additionally, total commercial criticized assets decreased by $435 million, an 8% reduction during the quarter.\nOur provision expense for the quarter resulted in a $43 million build in our allowance for credit losses. This build was primarily attributable to the strong growth in period-end loans and a modest deterioration in the Moody's macroeconomic scenarios. Our ACL coverage ratio was 2.08%, down 1 basis point from the third quarter. We made no changes to our scenario weightings during the quarter.\nMoving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.5%, significantly exceeding our buffered minimum of 7.7% and consistent with our near-term target. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.1%, up 32 basis points year-over-year. We anticipate continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, given that approximately 60% of the fixed rate securities in our AFS portfolio are in bullet or lockout structures, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations.\nAssuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 18% of the AOCI related to the securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 5% before considering any future earnings. During the quarter, our $300 million share repurchase reduced our share count by 6.7 million shares.\nMoving to our current outlook. We entered 2025 with strong momentum and a resilient balance sheet and remain confident in our ability to achieve record NII and full year positive operating leverage. We expect full year NII to increase 5% to 6%. This outlook uses the forward curve at the start of January, which assumes a 25 basis point rate cuts in March and October. We would not change our NII guidance for 2025, even if we assume that no cuts will occur.\nWe expect full year average total loans to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2024, with the increase primarily driven by the broad-based improvement in C&I combined with continued growth in auto loans. We are assuming that the cash position, securities portfolio and commercial revolver utilization all remain relatively stable throughout 2025.\nFull year adjusted noninterest income is expected to be up 3% to 6%, reflecting continued revenue growth in commercial payments, capital markets and wealth and asset management. partially offset by the continued runoff of the operating lease business, muted mortgage originations given the rate environment and the year-over-year impact of the final TRA revenue occurring in 2024.\nWe expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2024. Our expense outlook assumes accelerated branch openings in high-growth Southeast markets and continued sales force additions in middle market, commercial payments and wealth to increase our production capacity to support our strategic growth initiatives. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be up 4% to 6%, PPNR to grow in the 6% to 7% range and positive operating leverage closer to 2%.\nMoving to credit. We expect 2025 net charge-offs to be between 40 and 49 basis points. Assuming no changes in macroeconomic forecasts, we expect the provision to build between $50 million and $100 million due to loan growth.\nMoving to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect NII to be flat with the fourth quarter of 2024 as the benefits of loan growth, fixed rate asset repricing and the continued reduction in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities should offset the impact of 2 fewer days. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% in the first quarter due to continued momentum in C&I and auto.\nExcluding the impact of the TRA, we expect noninterest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter, mainly due to normal seasonality in card spend, capital markets activity and other commercial banking revenue. First quarter adjusted noninterest expense is expected to be up 8% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes.\nExcluding the seasonal items of approximately $100 million, expenses would be flat in the first quarter. We expect first quarter charge-offs to be in the 45 to 49 basis point range and expect the ACL build will be $10 million to $25 million due to loan growth.\nFinally, we expect to execute $225 million in share repurchases in the first quarter with future quarter share repurchases dependent on the level of loan growth. We will continue to target our CET1 ratio around 10.5% and while we await more clarity around the future of the capital rules and other regulations.\nIn summary, with our resilient balance sheet, diversified revenue streams and disciplined expense and credit risk management, 2025 is set to be a year of continuing long-term investments, record NII, positive operating leverage and strong returns for our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call for Q&A.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nThanks, Brian. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator, please open the call for Q&A."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2024 Fifth Third Bancorp Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Matt Curo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Brian Preston will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Shrek, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. .\nPlease review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results. as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Brian, we will open up the call for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they perform in benign environments but rather how they navigate challenging ones. In that context, I'm very pleased with how we are executing as a company in what continues to be an uncertain economic and interest rate backdrop.\nOur focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order have produced consistent predictable results and strong profitability since the bank failures last spring, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in line with or better than our original expectations for the full year in 2024. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.81 or $0.86 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, which exceeded the guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call. Our resilient balance sheet, diversified fee revenues and expense discipline continued to produce strong profitability.\nOur adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.1% and and adjusted return on assets of 1.22% over the last 12 months, ranked as the best of all peers who have reported so far and the most stable when compared to the same period last year. The second quarter marked the first sequential growth in NII since 2022, and NIM improved for the second consecutive quarter. That trajectory, along with the benefits we are seeing from strategic investments and continued expense discipline should allow us to return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of this year and carry over into next year. Strategically, our investments in the Southeast and middle market expansion markets in commercial payments and in wealth and asset management continue to produce strong growth and market share gains. We grew consumer households by 3% year-over-year in the second quarter, punctuated by 6% growth in our Southeast markets. Middle market loan production and new quality relationships were the strongest in Indiana, the Carolinas, Texas and California.\nIn our industry verticals, production was strongest where federal government spending has had an outsized benefit including in aerospace and defense contractors and with manufacturing and infrastructure construction firms. Commercial Payments revenue grew 12% year-over-year, driven by our investments in our software-enabled managed services and New Line, our embedded payments business. Commercial Payments is a scale business for us.\nIn the first half of 2024 alone, we processed more than $8 trillion in volume, and nearly half of all new treasury management relationships we added year-to-date were payments led and have no credit extended. Wealth and Asset Management fee revenues grew 11% year-over-year and total assets under management grew to $65 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. First Third Securities, the Private Bank and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors, the RIA platform we launched in 2022, all generated strong performance. Digital Banker and Global Private Banker recognized us again as the best private bank for high net worth clients for the third consecutive year.\nTurning to capital. Our strong profitability allowed us to resume share repurchases during the quarter, while also increasing our CET1 ratio to 10.6%. The Federal Reserve stress test results highlighted our strong capital levels, consistent profitability and simple yet well-diversified business model. Importantly, we maintain the capacity to increase our dividend, support organic growth and continued share repurchases.\nAs we look ahead to the rest of the year, we remain cautious due to the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could unfold. As a result, we will remain disciplined and will not chase loan growth at the expense of our return targets. We continue to maintain flexibility by staying liquid neutrally positioned and broadly diversified all while investing in the long term.\nBefore I hand it over to Brian to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to express my gratitude to our employees for the consistent hard work, innovation and passion for service that you bring to our customers. This morning, Euromoney named us the best super regional bank in the U.S. as part of their 2024 awards for excellence, I'm honored to be part of your team. With\nthat, Bryan, over to you.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our second quarter results were strong, reflecting our balance sheet strength, diversified revenue streams and disciplined approach to expense and credit risk management. For more than a year, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment.\nThis approach has proven effective as the market's expectations on rate cuts changed dramatically from the start of 2024. Despite this change in rate outlook, our NII has been consistent with the performance trajectory we discussed back in December, increasing sequentially during the second quarter from the first quarter bottoming, and NIM has increased for 2 consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter low.\nAdditionally, our full year 2024 NII outlook remains unchanged. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remained strong and stable which allowed us to resume share repurchases early and grow our CET1 ratio to 10.6%, up 13 basis points. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, our reported results were impacted by certain items including the valuation of the Visa total return swap, an update to the FDIC special assessment and the impact of certain legal settlements and customer remediation. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net interest income for the quarter increased 1% from the prior quarter to $1.4 billion, and adjusted net interest margin improved 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Increased yields on new loan production contributed to this improvement and offset the impact of increased interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were well managed and increased only 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter.\nWhile total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, led by our indirect auto business. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, and primarily reflecting the increase in indirect auto originations, offset by a decrease in other consumer loan balances. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 1% due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers.\nPeriod-end commercial revolver utilization remained at 36%, consistent with the prior quarter. Middle market loan production increased 2% compared to the prior quarter driven by strong performance in our Southeast markets, primarily in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida as well as continued success in Indiana, Texas and California. The pipeline for the second half of the year is improving, and we are continuing to invest in our middle-market banking teams, including our recently announced expansion in the Alabama market.\nHowever, we remain cautious on commercial loan growth expectations in the second half of the year. as customer demand for credit remains muted. Our investment in analytics continues to help us optimize deposit outcomes demonstrated by our strong deposit growth in 2023 and prudent management of deposit costs in 2024. Our strong track record of liquidity management, combined with data-driven analytics will aid in maintaining pricing discipline and optimizing liability costs.\nAverage core deposits were flat sequentially, driven by higher CDs and consumer savings and money market balances, offset by lower interest checking and commercial demand balances. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs with the Fed on hold and preparing for potential rate cuts later this year. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially, while both commercial and wealth deposits decreased 2%. The Southeast branch investments are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 25% as of the end of the second quarter, stable with the prior quarter. as migration of DDA balances continues to slow.\nConsistent with our prior expectations for a higher for longer rate environment, we expect DDA mix to fall below 25% during the third quarter and stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 137% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 72%. We are well positioned to continue to grow net interest income, and our balance sheet provides flexibility to navigate the evolving economic and interest rate conditions. Moving on to fees.\nExcluding the impact of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted noninterest income decreased $32 million or 4% compared to the year ago quarter. This year-over-year decrease is attributable to a $34 million private equity gain recognized in the second quarter of 2023. Within our businesses, commercial payments and wealth and asset management fees continued to deliver strong results, both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our continued strategic growth investments in products and sales personnel.\nThese areas are not only fast growing, but are sizable contributors to fee income and profitability today given our strength and scale in these businesses. We expect these businesses to continue to deliver strong revenue growth. Our market-sensitive businesses, such as mortgage and commercial customer hedging have been impacted by the higher rate environment, the reduced demand for credit and reduced market volatility.\nThe combined impact for these businesses was a $20 million decrease versus the prior year. Leasing business revenue was down $9 million versus the prior year due to our decision to deemphasize operating leases, but it is offset by a $9 million decrease in leasing business expense. The securities gains of $3 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. While we have continued to invest on expense discipline and the ongoing befits from the process automation efforts. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased 7% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal items during the first quarter related to compensation awards and payroll taxes.\nMoving to credit. Consistent with our guidance, the net charge-off ratio was 49 basis points, up 11 basis points sequentially, driven by 2 commercial credits for which we had previously established specific reserves. Consumer charge-offs were 57 basis points, a reduction of 10 basis points sequentially, primarily due to improvement in our indirect consumer secured portfolio. Other credit metrics showed strong sequential improvement, with the ratio of early-stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due, decreasing 3 basis points to 26 basis points, which is near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade.\nNPAs decreased by $100 million or 13% during the quarter, and the NPA ratio decreased 9 basis points to 55 basis points. In commercial, our credit discipline is grounded in generating and maintaining granular, high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region or industry. We continue to see no material signs of broad-based industry or geographic weakness and believe potential future commercial credit losses will be idiosyncratic in nature. In Consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures. We have maintained our conservative underwriting policies, and we'll continue to evaluate our positioning as economic conditions change.\nOur ACL coverage ratio decreased 4 basis points to 2.08% and included a $47 million reserve release driven by the previously mentioned specific reserves. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6% and significantly exceeding our new buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. As we assess our capital priorities, we believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level.\nDuring the quarter, we completed $125 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 3.5 million shares. Our pro forma CD21 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 80%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that 61% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. .\nAssuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 10% before considering any future earnings. 62% of the securities-related AOCI will accrete back to equity by the end of 2028.\nMoving to our current outlook. While the rate environment and customer credit demand have played out differently than we were expecting at the start of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in line with or better than our original expectations for the full year. We expect full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%, consistent with our guidance from January.\nThis outlook assumes the forward curve as of early July, which projected 2 rate cuts in the second half of the year, September and December. We also believe we can deliver this NI outcome with no interest rate cuts and no loan growth in the second half of 2024. Given the year-to-date trends in customer activity, we now expect full year average total loans to be down 3% compared to 2023. Average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be stable to up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with similar performance in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Customer demand is the primary driver of this change given the interest rate environment and other economic uncertainties. If there's more economic optimism in the second half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth in line or better than market growth.\nWe are forecasting fourth quarter average core deposit growth of 2% to 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our forecast also assumes commercial revolver utilization and our cash and other short-term investments remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be stable to down 1% in 2024, reflecting the impact of weaker than previously expected credit demand and customer hedging activities.\nWe expect strong growth in commercial payments and wealth and asset management revenue to continue. In response to this expectation of lower customer activity in the second half, we expect to manage full year adjusted noninterest expense stable to 2023 levels. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales additions in middle market, commercial payments and wealth. We will open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher-growth markets and have already closed a similar number of branches in 2024. Our outlook still projects an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year. For full year 2024, the net charge-off outlook remains in the 35 to 45 basis point range. While we expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth and mix in the second half of 2024. We expect the second half build to be less than the first half of 2024 release.\nTherefore, we expect full year provision to be a 0 to $10 million release, assuming no change to credit quality of the portfolio or projected economic conditions. Moving to our quarterly outlook. We expect NII and NIM growth to continue in both the third and fourth quarter. We expect NII in the third quarter to be up 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the continued benefit of our fixed rate asset repricing.\nOur current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 295 basis points in the second quarter of 2024, and to increase just 4 basis points sequentially, if we see no rate cuts. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the second quarter, we expect modest middle market auto and solar production to offset continued low credit demand from corporate banking customers.\nWe expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter, largely reflecting strength in commercial payments and wealth and asset management and a modest increase in commercial banking revenue. We expect third quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 1% compared to the second quarter due to the impact of the previously discussed investments in branches, technology and sales personnel.\nThird quarter net charge-offs are projected to be in the 40 to 45 basis point range. As mentioned in the full year outlook, loan growth and mix are expected to drive a provision build, which should be around $25 million in the third quarter. assuming no change to the economic outlook. The trajectory of our income statement performance should deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter 2024 and a net interest income exit rate for the year that positions us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we expect to execute share repurchases of $200 million per quarter in the second half of 2024, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue streams, we are positioned to generate sustained top quartile profitability and deliver long-term value for our shareholders, customers, communities and employees.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\n[Operator Instructions]"

My name is Elie, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to hand over the call to Matt Curoe. You may now begin the conference.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fifth Third's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Brian Preston will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation.\nThese materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of April 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Brian, we will open up the call for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. .\nIn that sense, the uncertainty we face in the current environment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate that our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order will produce consistently strong some might even say boring financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.70 or $0.76 excluding the Visa MasterCard settlement litigation charges and the additional FDIC special assessment. All major income statement captions were in line with or better than the guidance that we provided in our January earnings call. Our adjusted return on equity and return on assets are the highest of all peers who have reported thus far and the most stable when compared to results from the first quarter of 2023.\nWe grew period-end deposits compared to the prior quarter and generated an annualized consumer household growth of 3%, punctuated by 7% growth in our Southeast markets. Since 2018, we have built more than 100 de novo branches in the Southeast. As a portfolio, they are exceeding our expectations, having achieved 112% of their household growth goals and 132% of the deposit goals built into the business cases.\nFlorida is our top-performing de novo market with deposit dollars at 195% in gold. J.D. Power also recently named Fifth Third #1 for retail banking customer satisfaction in the Florida market. Importantly, net interest margins improved in the quarter driven by stabilizing deposit costs, with interest-bearing deposit costs increasing only 1 basis point sequentially. Consistent with our guidance last year, the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the low point for NIM, and we believe the first quarter of 2024 will mark the low point for NII.\nWhile end-of-period loan balances were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint with Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas achieving the strongest results. Our footprint continues to benefit in an outsized way from federal incentives to bolster investments in domestic manufacturing and energy infrastructure. The Midwest and Southeast have received more investment per capita than other U.S. regions in industries as diverse as multimodal logistics, semiconductors, batteries and pet food.\nTreasury Management and Wealth and Asset Management were the strongest contributors to fee income, driven by the strategic investments we have been making in both areas. Treasury management revenue grew 11% year-over-year driven by our software-enabled managed services payments offerings and Newline, our embedded payments business.\nOver 1/3 of the new treasury management relationships added in the quarter were payments led and had no credit extended. Wealth and Asset Management fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year, highlighted by strong growth in Fifth Third Wealth Advisors. The RIA platform we launched in 2022, which recently crossed $1 billion in assets under management. Our credit performance remained stable, highlighted by continued strength in our commercial real estate portfolio. We posted another quarter of 0 net charge-offs in CRE and have less than $3 million of NPAs in our nonowner-occupied portfolio. While we expect that broader credit trends will continue to normalize, our emphasis on client selection and credit discipline helps to ensure that we have a well-diversified portfolio, not overly concentrated in any asset class industry or geography.\nExpenses are well controlled. Adjusted for discrete items highlighted in the release, expenses declined 1% year-over-year driven by savings realized through process automation and our focus on value streams. Expense discipline is what has allowed us to make the long-term investments in our business necessary to generate superior returns and operating leverage through the cycle.\nLooking forward to the rest of the year, we remain cautious given the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could materialize. Depending on how you read the most recent data, inflation is either sticky at 3% slowly moving down to 2% or moving back up past 4%. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated and deficit spending, green energy investments and the domestication of supply chains are all inherently inflationary in the medium term. We believe the best way to manage an uncertain times is to stay liquid, stay neutrally positioned and stay broadly diversified while investing with the long term in mind. That is what we intend to do.\nI want to thank our employees. Your [indiscernible] heart and dedication are why we've been recognized thus far in 2024 as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune, one of the best brands for customer service by Forbes and one of the world's most ethical companies by [ Espisphere ]. Thank you for keeping our shareholders, customers and communities at the center of everything we do.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our first quarter results and our current outlook for 2024.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our first quarter results were a strong start to the year, reflecting our balance sheet strength, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified fee revenue streams. We saw new household growth accelerate and new quality relationships in commercial [ posted ] gains.\nFor over a year, we have highlighted the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. Our first quarter results evidenced the strength of our current position which should produce strong and stable returns across a wide range of economic outcomes. This approach has served us well as rate cut expectations are pushed out.\nAs Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong as we have the highest ROA and ROE and among the best efficiency ratios of our peers that have reported to date in a quarter in which we have outsized seasonal compensation expenses. On a year-over-year basis, we were the most stable for both ROA and ROE and among the most stable for NII and the efficiency ratio.\nOur consistent and strong earnings added 15 basis points to CET1 during the quarter, inclusive of absorbing 8 basis points impact from the CECL phase-in. Turning to the income statement. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion and consistent with our expectations. Interest-bearing deposit costs were well managed and increased only 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter.\nThe balance sheet continues to be reflective of defensive positioning with optionality to navigate the changing economic and interest rate environments. Net interest margin improved 1 basis point for the quarter, increased yields on new production of fixed rate consumer loans and day count benefits contribute to the growth and were partially offset by the deposit balance migration from demand to interest-bearing accounts.\nThis increase in NIM is the first sequential improvement since the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impacts of secured gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted noninterest income decreased 1% from a year ago quarter due to lower revenue in commercial banking, leasing and mortgage, partially offset by strong growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management fees, where both saw double-digit revenue growth over the prior year.\nThe securities gains of $10 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased 1% compared to the year ago quarter due to our continued focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from our process automation efforts. While expenses are down versus the prior year, we continue to invest in opening new branches and increased marketing spend to drive household growth. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 8% sequentially as expected due to seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes in addition to $15 million of expense from the previously mentioned nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Moving to the balance sheet.\nTotal average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 2% due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers and the average balance impact of last year's RWA diet, which reduced both total commitments and loan balances during the second half of 2023. Middle market loans increased during the quarter as we drive for more granularity and our winning private bank relationships. As Tim discussed, we saw solid middle-market loan growth across our footprint. Period-end commercial revolver utilization was 36%, a 1% increase from the prior quarter, also driven by middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially due to the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations, given the rate environment, offset by growth from solar energy installation loans and indirect auto originations.\nAverage core deposits decreased 1% sequentially, driven primarily by normal seasonality within our business. Decreases in DDA balances and CDs were partially offset by increases in interest checking. By segment, average consumer deposits decreased 1% sequentially, while both commercial and wealth deposits were flat.\nConsumer deposits rebounded towards the end of the quarter to finish slightly higher than at the start of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the results of our multiyear Southeast branch investments, which are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. DDA as a percent of core deposits was 25% as of the end of the first quarter compared to 26% in the prior quarter. Migration of DDA balances continued during the first quarter, and we expect that trend to carry on in 2024, but at a slower pace than in prior quarters. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 135%, and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%. The strong funding profile continues to provide us with great flexibility.\nMoving to credit. Asset quality trends remain well behaved and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 38 basis points, which was up 6 basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. The ratio of early-stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points sequentially to 29 bps. The NPA ratio increased 5 basis points to 64 basis points. We have maintained our credit discipline by generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region or industry.\nIn consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. We continue to see the expected normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we assessed forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm-specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress.\nMoving to the ACL. Our reserve coverage ratio remained unchanged at 2.12% and included a $16 million reserve release driven by lower end-of-period loan balances and modest improvements in the economic scenarios. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings.\nMoving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.4%, and we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. As a reminder, at the beginning of the quarter, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held to maturity. This represented 1/4 of our AFS portfolio and was done when the 5- and 10-year treasury rates were below 4%. The move reduced AOCI volatility to capital due to our investment portfolio by around 50% during the first quarter.\nOur pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the AFS securities portfolio is 7.8%. We expect improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that 60% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 62% by the end of 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out. Moving to our current outlook.\nWe expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, consistent with our prior expectations. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2023 RWA diet on average balances as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher interest rate environment. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 with both commercial and consumer balances up low single digits by the end of 2024.\nWe are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remains stable. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be stable. We expect softness in commercial due to uncertainty on the interest rate and economic outlooks to be offset by consumer loan growth, which is expected to be up due to solar and auto originations. Our retail household growth and commercial payments growth remained robust in the first quarter, and those outcomes will drive deposit growth in 2024. However, we are mindful of potential economic and market headwinds for monetary policy.\nTherefore, we are forecasting full year average core deposit growth of only 2% to 3% compared to our 5% growth realized in 2023. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration has declined. If rates remain at current levels, we expect to see the DDA mix dip below 25% during the middle of the year.\nShifting to the income statement. Given the stabilization in our deposit costs and the benefit we are seeing from the repricing of our fixed rate loan book, we continue to expect the full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%. And as Tim mentioned, we expect the NII and NIM trough is behind us. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early April, which projected 3 total cuts. However, our balance sheet is neutrally positioned so that even with 0 cuts in 2024, we expect stability in our NII outlook. The primary risk to our NII performance would be a reacceleration of deposit competition.\nOur forecast also assumes our cash and other short-term investments, which ended the quarter at over $25 billion remained relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect NII in the second quarter to be stable to up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the benefit of our fixed rate loan repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 291 basis points in the first quarter of 2024, would increase about 6 basis points sequentially, if we see no rate cuts.\nWe expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting growth in treasury management, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue. We expect second quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up 2% to 4% compared to the first quarter. largely reflecting higher commercial banking revenue. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth.\nWe will also open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher-growth markets and close a similar number of branches in 2024. We expect second quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be down approximately 6% compared to the first quarter due to the seasonal compensation and benefits costs in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range.\nThis outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. We continue to expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. Our outlook for 2024 net charge-offs remains in the 35 to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize, with second quarter net charge-offs also in the 35 to 45 basis point range.\nWe expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth, assuming no change to the economic outlook. Loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $75 million to $100 million build for the full year, with the second quarter build being approximately $0 to $25 million. As we mentioned last quarter, our consistent and strong earnings provides us the flexibility to resume share repurchases of $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million in the third quarter, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue growth, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With\nthat, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A.\n\nMatt Curoe\n\nThanks, Brian. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call for Q&A. ."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Matt Curo, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fifth Third's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our Chairman, President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Brian Preston will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Operating Officer, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. .\nThese materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves based on how they navigate challenging and uncertain operating environment. 2023 was certainly a challenging year for the industry, but I am very pleased with how we measure up. Our defensive balance sheet positioning, strong execution and multiyear strategic investments produced top quartile profitability, the best core deposit growth and the best total shareholder return among all regional peers who did not participate in an FDIC-assisted transaction.\nWe generated an all-time record full year revenue of $8.7 billion. Deposits grew 5% compared to an industry-wide decline of 3%. Credit performance was strong with net charge-offs remaining below historical averages. And although it would be fish to expect it to repeat forever. In commercial real estate, we experienced 0 net charge-offs in 2023 and only 2 basis points of delinquent loans as of early January. These strong outcomes, combined with our multiyear expense discipline produced a full year adjusted return on assets of 1.25% and adjusted return on tangible common equity ex AOCI of 15.9% and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 55.9%, all among the best of our peers.\nWe also continue to take market share organically by growing our customer base and deepening relationships. We grew consumer households by 3% overall, punctuated by 6% growth in the Southeast. In commercial, we added a record number of new quality middle-market relationships, up 11% over the prior year. As a result, we grew or maintained our deposit market share position in all 40 of our largest MSAs. As we turn the page to 2024, we remain focused on differentiating Fifth Third based on the strength and consistency of our financial performance by prioritizing stability, profitability and growth in that order. Bryan will take you through the detail on the fourth quarter and our outlook for the year shortly. But before that, I would like to touch on a few points.\nThe first of these is the strength of our balance sheet. Our defensive positioning and decision to move quickly to adapt to proposed regulatory changes have put us in a position to play offense in 2024. Having achieved full category 1 LCR compliance on August 31 and maintained it since, our liquidity position is very strong. We completed our RWA diet in the fourth quarter and accreted nearly 50 basis points of CET1, putting us on pace to reach a 10.5% CET1 ratio by midyear 2024. Given our strong earnings profile and the significant rally in interest rates in December, our tangible book value per share grew nearly 30% during the fourth quarter.\nAt the beginning of January, we made $12.6 billion of securities to held to maturity, representing roughly 1/4 of our AFS portfolio. We expect this move will derisk potential AOCI volatility to capital by about 30% in the event that market rates rise again. If the economic outlook remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, no worse than the current NPR, these actions put us in a position to resume share repurchases of up to $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million as early as the beginning of the third quarter. Should the final rules prove less stringent than the initial proposals, we will have additional flexibility in deploying excess capital and liquidity to further improve profitability and position Fifth Third for growth.\nThe second point I'd like to highlight is profitability. Expense discipline and strong returns and positive operating leverage remain core areas of focus for Fifth Third. Supported by our technology modernization investments and a focus on leaning out key value streams, we reduced full-time equivalent employee head count by 4% from our peak in 2023 to the end of the year without the need for a company-wide expense program. The run rate benefits of these efforts put us in a position to sustain the peer-leading annualized expense growth that we have averaged for the past several years, even as we continue to invest for growth. While the carryover effect of the RWA diet makes it unfeasible for the full year, we do anticipate returning to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024.\nThe third point I'd like to highlight is about growth. Our strategies have been consistent, building out our Southeast markets, producing a strong fee to total revenue mix and leveraging software that differentiates our product offerings and improves productivity. These are multiyear investments that cannot be replicated easily by competitors through 1 to 2 years of hiring a few new branches or small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2023, we opened 37 new branches concentrated in the Southeast, bringing us to 107 opened over the past 5 years. We plan to open another 31 branches in the Southeast in 2024.\nAs a portfolio, these branches have continued to outperform our expectations on both household acquisition and deposit growth and should provide a tailwind for several years forward. We also continue to invest in treasury management, wealth and asset management and capital markets. All 3 of these businesses grew for us in 2023, and we expect mid- to high single-digit growth in each in 2024. In treasury management, our acquisitions of RISE and Big Data Healthcare and the launch of New Line, our embedded payments business should continue to support peer-leading performance.\nIn Wealth and Asset Management, Global Finance recently named our Private Bank as Best U.S. regional Private Bank for the fifth consecutive year and best private bank for entrepreneurs globally for the first time. In our Capital Markets business, we have seen more robust activity levels to start the year, including an M&A pipeline that is 1.5x the full year revenue target embedded in our guidance. Overall, we expect 2024 to be a solid year of improving revenue trends and continued expense discipline. Given what we believe to be a less certain outlook than the markets would imply, we are positioned to perform well under a range of economic and interest rate scenarios.\nBefore I hand it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for [indiscernible] to deliver great results in 2023 and for the job you do every day to take care of our customers and communities. You make our companies a special place it is. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and our current outlook for 2024.\n\nBryan D. Preston\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. 2023 was a very different year than what we were expecting 12 months ago. For Fifth Third, our success in outperforming this year was driven by our intentional actions to create and maintain flexibility for navigating uncertainty. As we enter 2024, we are very pleased with the results from 2023 and how we continue to be well positioned for a wide range of economic outcomes. We have optionality in our balance sheet and diversification of our business mix that will allow us to adapt to changing environments.\nAs Tim mentioned, achieving this positioning requires discipline and years of deliberate investments. Our full year financial performance in 2023 benefited from this long-term investment. Fifth Third delivered industry-leading deposit growth of 5%, record revenue of $8.7 billion and 100 basis points of capital accretion during the year, all while maintaining expense and credit discipline. We delivered another solid quarter to end the year. Adjusting for the FDIT special assessment and the other discrete items listed on Page 2 of our release, return on assets was 1.3%, ROTCE was 17% and and our efficiency ratio was 55%.\nAdditionally, we completed our risk-weighted asset diet in the fourth quarter, which reduced RWA by 3%, which was a little more than we previously estimated. The diet, combined with our strong earnings led to a nearly 50 basis point increase in CET1 during the quarter, which ended at 10.3%. This capital accretion, combined with the rally in market rates during the fourth quarter, resulted in our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact from unrealized losses on AFS securities increasing to 7.7% at year-end, well above the 7% minimum.\nNet interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion, which was consistent with our expectations. While NII continues to be impacted by the increasing cost of deposits due to higher market interest rates, we have been able to build a robust liquidity position by generating peer-leading core deposit growth. Our core interest-bearing deposit costs increased 24 basis points sequentially, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 54% in the fourth quarter. We believe maintaining significant liquidity on balance sheet as a prudent decision given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments.\nOur short-term investments, which are primarily comprised of our cash at the Fed, increased $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter on an average basis and drove all of the 13 basis point sequential decrease in NIM. Excluding the impact of securities gains losses and the Visa total return swap, adjusted noninterest income increased 3% sequentially due to the growth in commercial banking, mortgage, wealth and card on processing revenues as well as the normal fourth quarter impact of the TRA. The growth in commercial banking fees was driven by strong institutional brokerage and improved corporate bond fees, offset by lower lease remarketing revenue. Fourth quarter noninterest income was also impacted by the decision to eliminate our extended overdraft fee, which was a driver of the decrease in service charges on deposits.\nCompared to the prior year, noninterest income decreased 3%, primarily due to a $25 million reduction in TRA revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by the impact of the nonqualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, which is mostly offset in securities gains losses. Excluding the impact of the NQDC mark, which was a $17 million expense in the fourth quarter compared to a $5 million benefit in the prior quarter expenses were flat sequentially. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter expenses were down 1%, which reflects our ongoing commitment to expense discipline Ken mentioned earlier.\nMoving to the balance sheet. As expected, total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 2% sequentially, most significantly driven by the 3% decrease in average total commercial loans. Our corporate banking business experienced the biggest reductions due to the RWA diet. With period-end, corporate banking total commitments decreasing 6% and unused commitments decreasing 4%. The Period end, commercial revolver utilization rate was 35%, a 1% decrease from the prior quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional pullback in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in the residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance.\nAverage core deposits increased 3% sequentially, driven by the growth in interest checking, money market and customer CD balances. DDA migration is showing signs of deceleration with fourth quarter showing the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle, even when adjusting for normal seasonal strength at year-end. DDA as a percent of core deposits were 26% for the quarter compared to 28% in the prior quarter. In addition to the migration impact, this measure is negatively impacted by the strong interest-bearing core deposit growth from new consumer and commercial relationships. By segment, average commercial deposits increased 5% sequentially while both consumer and wealth deposits increased 1%.\nAs a result of our balance sheet positioning, RWA diet and success growing deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 72% at year-end, which continues to rank as the best compared to our regional peers. As Tim mentioned, we ended the year with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 129%. The strong funding profile provides us with great flexibility as we enter 2024.\nMoving to credit. Asset quality trends remained strong and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 32 basis points which was down 9 basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. 30- to 89-day delinquencies are flat compared to the end of 2022, the NPA ratio increased 8 basis points to 59 basis points, but remains below our 10-year average of 65 basis points. We will maintain our credit discipline, focusing on generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships.\nIn consumer, we remain focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. However, we are beginning and expect to continue to see normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years.\nFrom an overall credit risk management perspective, we continue to assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL, while our reserve coverage increased 1 basis point sequentially to 2.12%, the ACL balance decreased by $41 million due to lower period-end loans, which was the primary driver of the release. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings.\nOur capital build is pacing ahead of the expectations we set at the beginning of the RWA diet. We are highly confident in our ability to build our CET1 ratio to 10.5% by June 2024. As Tim mentioned, on January 3, we made the decision to hold $12.6 billion of securities until maturity, resulting in the reclassification to HTM during 2024. This decision reduces the risk of potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations under the proposed capital rules. We continue to expect improvement in the unrealized losses in our remaining AFS portfolio, resulting in approximately 32% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and and approximately 66% by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out.\nAfter the transfer to HTM, 65% of the remaining AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. We continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level for our capital. And as Tim mentioned, we expect to resume share repurchases during the second half of 2024, assuming the economic environment remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, consistent with the NPR.\nMoving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, with the decrease primarily driven by the impact of the RWA diet on commercial loans and indirect consumer as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher rate environment, partially offset by the continued growth of dividend and provide. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nCommercial balances are expected to be up low single digits by the end of 2024 and and dividend originations are projected between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the full year. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remained stable. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be down 1%, again, driven by the full quarter impact of the RWA diet. Both commercial and consumer loans should be down around 1%. Dividend finance originations are projected to be $400 million to $500 million in the first quarter. Total loan balances should be relatively stable throughout the first quarter.\nWe expect deposit growth to continue during 2024 with full year average core deposits increasing 2% to 3%. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration will be sensitive to the path of the Fed funds rate in 2024. If rates remain at current levels, we could see the DDA mix dip below 25% by the fourth quarter of 2024. However, we would expect to show a more stable composition if the more aggressive rate cut forecast were to be realized.\nShifting to the income statement. Given the impact of the RWA diet on average loan balances, and the impact of higher deposit costs, we expect full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%. Our forecast assumes our security portfolio remains relatively stable and our cash levels began a slow but steady decrease throughout 2024. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early January, which projected 6 total rate cuts. Given the uncertainty regarding the rate outlook, our balance sheet is positioned such that even with fewer rate cuts, such as the 3 cut scenario being projected by the FOMC, we would expect to see only a modest deterioration in our NII outlook and would still fall within our full year guidance of down 2% to 4%.\nWe expect NII in the first quarter to be down 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the lower average loan balances, a lower day count in the quarter and higher deposit costs. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 289 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023, increase 5 to 10 basis points in the first quarter, a deceleration from the 24 basis point increase experienced in the fourth quarter.\nWith rate cuts forecasted to begin in late March and continue through the end of the year, we would expect deposit costs to decrease throughout the remainder of 2024. Under this outlook, the terminal beta for the rising rate cycle would be in the mid-50s for interest-bearing core deposits. We continue to believe we are at our NIM trough in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, another quarter of outperformance in deposit growth resulting in a higher-than-expected cash position, while a good outcome could impact NIM by a few more basis points.\nBarring a significant change in economic outlook, we would expect NII to stabilize and then begin growing sequentially during the remainder of 2024. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, reflecting continued growth in treasury management revenue, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue partially offset by the full year impact of the elimination of our extended overdraft fee.\nWe expect mortgage origination will remain muted in 2024 and and net servicing revenue to decrease modestly as the servicing portfolio UPB continues to amortize lower. Adjusted other noninterest income, which excludes the impact of the Visa total return swap, is expected to decline by over 15% as TRA revenue will decrease from $22 million in 2023 to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we are not including any large onetime private equity gains in our forecast. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors.\nNormal seasonal items include lower capital markets activity and M&A activity partially offset by seasonal strength in wealth from tax planning. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid- to high single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth.\nwe will also close 29 branches in 2024 to offset costs associated with the 31 new branches opening in our high-growth Southeast markets. We expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 8% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding the seasonal items, expenses would be flat in the first quarter.\nIn total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. As Tim mentioned, we expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023.\nMoving to credit, we continue to expect 2024 net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize with first quarter net charge-offs in the 35 to 40 basis point range.\nAs we return to loan growth, we expect to resume provision builds. Assuming no change to the economic outlook, loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $100 million to $150 million of provision build for the year, with the first quarter being in the $0 to $25 million range. The provision build over the last 3 quarters of the year should be fairly even.\nIn summary, 2024 is expected to be a year of transition as we begin the shift to a rate cutting cycle with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nBefore we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. ."

My name is Rob, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nChris Doll, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jimmy Leonard, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, and also joined us with the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 19, 2023 and and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following the prepared remarks by Tim and Jimmy, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We believe that great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they perform in benign environments or rather by how they navigate challenging ones. That is why we focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order. It's also why I am so pleased that our key return and profitability metrics remain resilient despite the market-related headwinds that all banks are facing.\nEarlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 or $0.92 excluding a $0.01 impact from our Visa swap, reflecting strong PPNR results and favorable credit outcomes. We generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity ex AOCI of nearly 16%, which increased 50 basis points sequentially and a return on assets of 1.26%. We generated strong fee growth compared to the year ago quarter, supported by a more diverse range of fee income streams than peers and our investments in treasury management, capital markets and wealth management.\nOur third quarter total noninterest expense increased less than 2% compared to the year ago quarter, and we generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%. In the last 4 years, we have managed expenses to the lowest growth rate among peers despite also investing in growth by building more new branches, raising our minimum wage, modernizing our technology platforms and acquiring for fintech companies. Expense management at Fifth Third is a continuous process and not a program. Since March of this year, full-time equivalent employee head count is down 3.5%.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We generated 4% average deposit growth compared to the year ago quarter versus a 5% decline for the industry. New relationship growth remains strong. Consumer households grew more than 2%, led by 6% growth in the Southeast, a continuation of our multiyear growth base. New middle market relationships added year-to-date remain 25% ahead of last year's record base. Thanks to the release of the annual FDIC summary of deposits, the third quarter provides a unique opportunity to understand market share gains and losses on a metro area by metro area basis. This year, Fifth Third maintained or improved our market rank in every single one of our 40 largest MSAs.\nIn the Midwest, we maintained our #2 overall position behind JPMorgan Chase. In the Southeast, where we are just 4 years removed for opening our first next-gen branch, we have reached or are approaching target locational share in 8 of our original 11 focused markets. We intend to continue to open approximately 35 branches per year through 2028, at which time nearly 50% of our branches will be in Southeast markets. These market share gains are the byproduct of multiyear strategies that are not easily replicable by competitors. They include innovative operational deposit-oriented products like Momentum Banking, AI-driven customer acquisition strategies and the top quartile customer service model in addition to our investments in new branches.\nOur key credit metrics remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were in line with our July expectations in both early stage delinquencies and nonperforming assets improved sequentially. The ACL increased 3 basis points given slight changes to Moody's macroeconomic forecast.\nTurning to liquidity and capital. We made significant progress against our goal to adapt early to expected changes in the regulatory framework. Our focused efforts throughout the bank enabled us to end the quarter with $103 billion in total liquidity sources and to achieve full Category 1 LCR compliance at the end of both August and September. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our RWA optimization initiative. Total RWA declined 1% compared to the prior quarter. Our exercise should be complete by the end of the fourth quarter, so we can return to growing loans next year.\nWe created over 30 basis points of CET1 capital during the quarter, reflecting our strong earnings power while we also raised our quarterly dividend by 6%. With respect to the economy, while aggregate figures on spending and employment remains strong and market sentiment has shifted more in favor of a soft landing. We continue to be more cautious given concerning signals disguised beneath the aggregates. For example, while the most recent headline payroll numbers were strong, most, if not all, the job growth is a byproduct of more people working part-time jobs. Real average weekly earnings slipped every month during the quarter and the lower end of the consumer spectrum now maintains deposit balances below pre-COVID levels. Anecdotally, the last time Google searches for soft landing was this high was in May of 2008.\nBefore I turn it over, I want to say thank you to our employees for everything you do to take care of our customers, strengthen our communities and support one another. Your efforts are why Time Magazine recently recognized Fifth Third as one of the world's best companies, and why I am as confident as ever in Fifth Third's ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders.\nWith that, Jamie will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & Treasurer, Fifth Third Bank\n\nThank you, Tim, and thanks all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity levels ahead of pending regulations while also managing our business very efficiently. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%, reflecting ongoing expense discipline throughout the bank and the continued diversification and resilience of our fee revenue streams.\nNet interest income of approximately $1.45 billion decreased 1% sequentially. Our NII and NIM results reflect our proactive and continued defensive positioning given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which primarily represent our cash held at the Fed increased $5 billion on an average basis and increased $8 billion on an end-of-period basis to $19 billion. This increased level of cash was the primary driver of our 12 basis point NIM decline.\nAdjusted noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in capital markets and deposit service charge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue driven primarily by lower origination volumes. Our ability to produce strong capital markets revenue in a volatile market has become a key distinction for Fifth Third compared to many peers.\nAdjusted noninterest expense increased just 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in compensation and benefits, occupancy and technology expenses partially offset by continued expense discipline across the company.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially and due to softening customer demand and our RWA optimization efforts. Average C&I balances decreased 2% sequentially. As Tim mentioned, clients remain cautious with respect to their growth plans. Consequently, production was muted in corporate banking. Also, average CRE balances decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 36% increased 1% compared to last quarter, partially due to our exit of certain lower returning unused commercial commitments.\nOn a sequential basis, total corporate banking commitments and unused commitments decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, while total middle market commitments and unused commitments increased 5% and 7%, respectively. This trend highlights our capital optimization efforts while we continue to grow share in the middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional decline in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations, given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance.\nOur card balances increased just 1% this quarter, reflecting our conservative risk culture and focus on transactors. Balances have increased 3% relative to the year ago quarter compared to 11% for the industry. Average total deposits increased 3% sequentially as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were partially offset by a decline in demand deposits given the mix shift we have seen for several quarters. DDAs as a percent of core deposits were 28% for the quarter compared to 30% in the prior quarter. The 2-point decline was primarily due to the strong deposit growth in the denominator that Tim highlighted from our net new relationship growth in both Consumer and Commercial, which are obviously skewed to interest-bearing products in this environment.\nAs a result, we added more than $4 billion in core deposits during the quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the DDA migration continued to show signs of deceleration this quarter and marked the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially, and commercial deposits increased 4%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 2% and reflecting clients' alternative investment options.\nAs a result of our balance sheet positioning and success adding new deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 74% and at quarter end, which should be one of the best, if not the best, compared to our regional peers. We also achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance at 118% at quarter end.\nMoving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit has remained resilient. The net charge-off ratio of 41 basis points increased 12 basis points compared to the prior quarter as we expected, reflecting 2 credits, which had been fully reserved. Early stage delinquencies decreased 7% compared to the prior quarter, while loans 90 days past due, of just 2 basis points or a record low for Fifth Third.\nNonperforming loans decreased 9%. This quarter marked the lowest inflows of commercial NPLs since the second quarter of 2022. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we tightened underwriting standards during COVID, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet.\nIn Consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained conservative underwriting policies. In Commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Our criticized nonperforming and delinquent CRE loans have all improved sequentially and remain very well behaved.\nAnd within that, the same is true for our office exposures. For instance, criticized office loans represented just 5.4% of total office CRE, which improved 180 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we have 0 delinquencies and 0 charge-offs. We also decreased loan balances by 8% in the office book without any loan sales. These credit quality metrics are significantly better than peers who have reported their office exposure so far this quarter. While credit quality in the office portfolio has remained very strong, and we continue to believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We nevertheless continue to watch it closely given the environment.\nOur shared national credit portfolio also remains very strong from a credit quality perspective, with criticized assets, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs consistently lower than the overall commercial portfolio across a multiyear period. Our credit resilience highlights our proactive risk culture. We continue to closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress throughout the entire portfolio as well as the fallout from the ongoing labor strike in the auto manufacturing sector, where we think our exposures are very manageable.\nMoving to the ACL. Our reserves decreased $5 million, but the coverage ratio increased 3 basis points sequentially to 2.11% as the impact of lower period end loans was offset by a slightly worse overall base case economic outlook. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. Both the Moody's base scenario and the downside scenario used for the third quarter ACL assume a slightly worse average unemployment rate compared to the prior quarter. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each the upside and downside scenarios.\nMoving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 31 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 9.8%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation, combined with the impact of our RWA diet. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect improvement in our unrealized securities losses resulting in approximately 35% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 2/3 by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out.\nLooking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiative and our continued deferment of share buybacks. We anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year above 10%.\nMoving to our current outlook. We expect fourth quarter average total loan balances to decline 2% to 3% sequentially with consumer loans down 2% and commercial loans down 3%. The reflects our overall cautious economic outlook combined with one more quarter of our RWA diet as we are responding quickly to higher risk-adjusted return thresholds throughout the bank considering the economic and regulatory environments. We expect average deposits to be up slightly on a sequential basis. Within that, we expect core deposits to increase 1% due to our multiyear investments in the franchise to add households and primary commercial relationships, along with the benefit from seasonality. While we continue to expect modest migration from DDA into interest-bearing products in a higher for longer interest rate environment, specifically for the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of DDA to core deposits to remain relatively stable given those seasonal benefits.\nShifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter NII to be down approximately 1% to 2% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. Our NII guidance assumes no additional rate hikes and a cumulative beta, which includes CDs and excludes DDAs of 55% by the fourth quarter. Excluding brokered deposits that we have been using as a replacement for other wholesale funding, given the pricing considerations, our cumulative beta expectation continues to be 53%. This outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 15 to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nOur guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable through year-end. As a byproduct of our strong deposit growth, combined with our loan outlook and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $20 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. Given these balance trends, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to continue to move lower through the end of the year, which will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements, including remaining compliant with the full Category 1 LCR.\nWe expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to increase 1% to 2% compared to the third quarter. We expect revenues to remain resilient across most captions driven by our multiyear focus on growing a diverse portfolio of fee businesses that should perform well in different economic environments. We expect fourth quarter TRA revenue of $22 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter. Our guidance excludes the pending FDIC special assessment, which we currently estimate at $208 million for Fifth Third.\nWith respect to credit quality, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be 30 to 35 basis points. We do expect to gradually normalize from here. We continue to believe that are through the cycle, annual charge-offs will be in the 35 to 45 basis point range given the credit risk profile of the bank. Given our reduced loan outlook, we expect the change in the ACL for the fourth quarter to be stable to up $25 million, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers production from dividend finance of around $700 million in the fourth quarter, which as you know, carries a higher reserve level of around 9%.\nIn summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements while continuing to generate long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. ."

My name is Rob and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nChris Doll, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fifth Third Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the GAAP results and forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 20, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the quarter, I'd like to welcome our new Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck to the call. Greg has been a part of Fifth Third for 35 years, and during that time, you see more than a few credit cycles. He previously held leadership roles in both credit risk and the line of business, including serving as our Chief Commercial Credit Officer for several years and is our Head of Leasing, asset-based lending and structured finance. We're fortunate to have him as part of the Fifth Third executive team.\nDespite heightened market volatility over the past 4 months, Fifth Third has delivered consistent top quartile financial results while investing strategically to position the bank for the long term. Our operating priorities have been and continue to be stability, profitability and growth in that order. Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.87, excluding items noted in the release, a 10% increase compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 9%, reflecting our diverse fee sources and resilient balance sheet. Expenses increased 4%, excluding items noted in the release. And credit quality was strong with net charge-offs and early stage delinquencies remaining below normalized levels. Our key return metrics improved even as we increased our capital levels and credit reserves. We generated an adjusted return on assets of over 1.2% and adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, of 15.4% and an efficiency ratio below 55% for the quarter. These will be important bellwether metrics for all banks as we adapt to impending regulatory changes. Deposits continue to be in focus for the [Audio Gap] it end deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 2% year-over-year as compared to a 5% decline [Audio Gap]. Given the year-over-year decline in deposit system-wide, it's reasonable to ask how Fifth Third has continued to outperform. The answers are deliberate multiyear strategies to expand distribution in our Southeast markets to launch innovative operational deposit-oriented solutions like momentum banking and our treasury management offerings and our sustained focus on primary household growth. We have added over 70 de novo branches in our Southeast footprint since 2019, more than any other bank except JPMorgan. As a portfolio, these branches are outperforming their original business cases on deposit production with several producing at a rate of 200% to 300% of plan.\nIn consumer, we generated year-over-year net household growth of 3% once again this quarter, continuing a strong multiyear trend and punctuated by 7% year-on-year growth in the Southeast and continued success in our Momentum banking product. In commercial, we have added a record number of new quality middle-market relationships this year, up 30% from 2022. Our embedded payments business, Newline, has also been a strong catalyst for deposit growth. We expect the environment in the back half of the year to remain highly competitive for deposits. While we will continue to protect our house relationships and manage to a strong and stable liquidity profile, we will not match a rational pricing competition in a way that prioritizes headline growth over profitability.\nTurning to pending regulation. We are taking steps to adapt our balance sheet in anticipation of higher capital and liquidity requirements across the industry. We finished the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 9.5% having accreted around 90 basis points of capital from retained earnings over the course of the past year. We are balancing 3 capital priorities, continuing to build capital on an accelerated pace, supporting a dividend increase in the third quarter subject to Board approval and supporting clients to drive organic growth. We will continue to pause share repurchases until the final capital rules are published and new capital targets are established. We are also taking several actions to boost on balance sheet liquidity and optimize returns. -- in reducing our indirect auto lending origination volumes by approximately 15% through the exit of noncore states, trimming outsized lines and closely evaluating select areas of our corporate banking business.\nWhile we acknowledge the market's more optimistic outlook, we remain vigilant on the potential for a recession in 2024. Our commercial clients continue to perform well, but they are being cautious by slowing their growth plans. Many are closely watching the impact that regulation may have on credit availability and pricing. Consumers have held up well in aggregate, but there has been a divergence between homeowners who were able to lock in historically low mortgage rates and renters who have had to face persistent inflation in their largest monthly expense. Compared to 3 years ago, homeowners in our deposit base have maintained strong deposit balances, whereas renters deposit balances are down meaningfully.\nI want to thank our nearly 20,000 employees for their unwavering commitment to serving clients in our communities. Last year, you volunteered more than 117,000 hours to community organizations and you provided leadership to roughly 1,200 not-for-profit boards. Due to your hard work, we have already delivered nearly $30 billion of our 10-year $100 billion commitment to provide affordable housing, access to essential services and renewable energy. In June, we celebrated Fifth Third's 165th anniversary. Given the current pace of technological and regulatory change and the logical questions about market structure and competitive model to follow. It was an interesting time to reflect on our history and what it could tell us about this moment.\nSince Fifth Third's founding in 1858, the company has withstood a civil war, 2 World Wars, 2 global health pandemic and 33 recessions. The company adapted its business model to take advantage of technological innovations including the telephone, electric white bulbs, the automobile and the Internet. We were an early adopter of the wire and ACH Windows, anchored the rollout of the credit card networks in the Midwest, invented the network ATM and were 1 of the 15 initial launch bankers. We witnessed the creation of the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and have continued to thrive through many different regulatory regimes. I believe that companies that stand the test of time, develop a character of their own that extends beyond the people who work there.\nFifth Third's character is rooted in hard work, ingenuity and insistence on excellence and the sense of responsibility for the communities we serve. I'm as confident as in Fifth Third's positioning, our ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders. And frankly, I'm just thankful to be part of [indiscernible] steward the bank into the future.\nWith that, I'll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & Treasurer, Fifth Third Bank\n\nThank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of just below 55%, which is a 4-point improvement compared to the prior quarter. Our second quarter adjusted PPNR grew more than 8% compared to both the prior quarter and year ago quarter, driven by the continued diversification and growth of our fee revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management throughout the bank. .\nNet interest income primate $1.46 billion increased 9% year-over-year, did decline 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was the result of our deliberate actions to grow on balance sheet liquidity to support a defensive balance sheet position, given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook and tightening liquidity conditions.\nInterest-bearing deposit costs increased 54 basis points to 2.3%, which represents a cycle-to-date beta of 45% on interest-bearing deposits, which includes the impact of CDs. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, with increases in mortgage fee income and commercial banking revenue partially offset by a decline in deposit service charges due to the impact of earnings credits from higher market rates and the elimination of our consumer NSF fees in July of last year. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter as elevated compensation and benefits expense was driven by nonqualified deferred compensation costs, the minimum wage increase that went into effect in July of 2022 and continued investment in dividend finance. Additionally, expenses increased from higher technology and communications expense and the impact of the increased FDIC assessment that began in January. Excluding the impacts of nonqualified deferred compensation, which are offset by a gross up in securities gains, the FDIC assessment increase and incremental expense growth from dividend finance, Total underlying expenses increased approximately 4% compared to the year ago quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases were stable sequentially in both commercial and consumer portfolios due to our continued discipline with respect to client selection and optimizing returns and also reflecting softening demand. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 35% decreased 2% compared to last quarter. C&I balances were flat compared to the prior quarter as strong middle market loan production and muted payoffs were offset by the lower revolver utilization. Corporate banking production was also tempered due to our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment and lower customer demand.\nAverage total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances reflected growth from dividend finance, offset by declines in indirect auto and residential mortgage. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, consumer deposits increased 1% and commercial deposits decreased 1%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 12%, reflecting the impact of tax payments as well as clients' alternative investment options. June activity reflected continued momentum such that period-end total deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 2% since the end of last June compared to a 5% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Fed's H8 data.\nMoving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends were stable with our key credit metrics remaining below normalized levels. The net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points increased 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The NPA ratio of 54 basis points was up 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which represents 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained one of the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Within CRE, we have limited office exposure with a low and improving criticized asset ratio and almost no delinquencies.\nWe continue to watch office closely and believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We had deemphasized office even before the pandemic, and we are not currently pursuing new office CRE originations. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we have been and remain cautious in our economic outlook. We tightened underwriting standards during COVID, including stressing credits to an up 200-basis-point scenario off the forward curve, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet. Since we began tightening underwriting standards, roughly 90% of our commercial portfolio has been re-underwritten. Our criticized assets have been stable over the past several quarters. Across all loan categories, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress.\nMoving to the ACL. Our reserves increased $87 million, reflecting the impacts of dividend finance and Moody's macroeconomic forecast, which eroded slightly. The ACL ratio increased 9 basis points sequentially. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.3%, while the downside scenario incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios.\nMoving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 25 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at over 9.5%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 11% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect a meaningful improvement in our unrealized loss position, assuming the forward curve plays out, resulting in approximately 36% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2024 and approximately 50% by the end of 2025. Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiatives and by extending our share buyback pause. As Tim mentioned, we will postpone repurchases until we have more clarity on the regulatory environment in order to determine the new level of required capital dollars. Assuming we do not buy back shares through year-end, we would anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year at or above 10%.\nMoving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loan growth between 1% and 2%, which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment and our decision to proactively adapt our balance sheet to the new regulatory regime. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low single digits area compared to 2022, which implies a decline in the second half of the year relative to the first half. This outlook assumes the revolver utilization rate of 35% in the second quarter remained stable throughout the remainder of 2023. Our commercial loan outlook also assumes that we meaningfully reduced originations in certain areas of the commercial franchise, predominantly in the corporate bank to meet our higher risk-adjusted return thresholds, while continuing to increase the generation in our core middle market business, we expect total consumer loans to be stable to down slightly from reduced originations of the lower-yielding out-of-footprint auto and specialty lending channels, combined with portfolio residential mortgages, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. We currently expect to need approximately $4 billion in dividend loans for this year, which is a modest decrease from our previous expectations. We continue to expect to grow deposits in the back half of 2023, assuming stable or even slightly tighter market liquidity conditions Consistent with our track record over the past year of taking market share and maintaining high levels of core operating relationships in both consumer and commercial. Within that, we continue to expect migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from 30% in the second quarter to 27% by year-end as we discussed last month.\nFor the third quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to decline 1% to 2% sequentially with commercial down in the low single digits area and consumer stable to slightly down. We expect average deposits to be up 1% on a sequential basis, impacted by our strong finish to the second quarter, some seasonal uplift and the benefits of our multiyear investments in the franchise that Tim discussed earlier.\nShifting to the income statement. We estimate full year NII will increase 3% to 5%, consistent with comments from the mid-June investor conference. Our AI guidance assumes a cumulative beta of 53% by the fourth quarter, assuming an additional 25 basis point rate hike in July and no further rate movements in 2023. Our outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing around 40 basis points in the third quarter and another 15 basis points or so in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remained relatively stable between now and year-end. As a byproduct of strong deposit growth, combined with lower loan growth and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $15 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. We expect our loan-to-core deposit ratio to end the year in the mid-70s area. It will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory environments. We expect third quarter NII to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable in 2023, resulting from continued success, increasing market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities. with stronger gross treasury management, capital markets, wealth and asset management and mortgage servicing revenue to be offset by higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, subdued leasing remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees due to lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter.\nWe expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions, which we conservatively assume will be more than offset by a slight erosion in debt capital markets and mortgage revenue. reflecting the environmental headwinds as well as lower other noninterest income. We continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. If capital markets fees improve relative to our current expectations, we will likely land at the upper end of the range. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1, the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reductant in 2022 expenses but an increase in 2023 and full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up 3%.\nOur guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid- to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors in the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first half of the year, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4%. This would result in an efficiency ratio of around 56% for the full year. We expect full year total net charge-offs to continue to be in our previously stated 25 to 35 basis point range. However, as you would expect, with normalizing credit costs in this environment from record low levels, there may be a little lumpiness in C&I in the second half such that total Bancorp's third quarter losses are expected to be 35 to 45 basis points and then fourth quarter losses improving relative to the third quarter.\nGiven our reduced loan growth outlook, we expect a lower quarterly build to the ACL in the $25 million to $75 million range, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers strong production from dividend finance of around $750 million in the third quarter, which, as you know, carries a higher reserve level. In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue generating long-term sustainable value for our customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. ."

Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call.\nPlease review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding to the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of April 20, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The past 6 weeks have seen a great deal of volatility in the banking sector. Markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals and the term regional bank has been used to describe such a broad cross-section of business models that has lost any real descriptive value.\nWhile we at Fifth Third take any instability in our sector very seriously, there was no crisis inside our 4 walls. We've been running the company with the expectation for a higher for longer rate environment for many quarters now as we've consistently communicated in these calls and at investor conferences. As our first quarter results demonstrate, our balance sheet remains well fortified and our capacity to generate strong profitability through the cycle is strong.\nExcluding items noted in the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.83, a 20% increase compared to the year ago quarter. We generated 9 points of year-over-year positive operating leverage, driven by an 18% increase in revenue. During the quarter, we held average and period-end deposits flat sequentially despite the industry-wide impact of quantitative tightening and normal seasonal pressures. Our key credit metrics remain near historical lows, with net charge-offs of 26 basis points coming in at the low end of our guidance range.\nNPAs, NPLs and early-stage delinquency ratios remained below normalized levels and criticized assets decreased modestly during the quarter. Moreover, we accomplished all this while also being recognized by Ethisphere as one of only 2 U.S. banks on their world's most ethical companies list. We were named by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. And we saw our fintech platform provide named by Fast Company as one of the world's most innovative businesses.\nThe strong outcomes achieved this quarter and in particular, in the month of March, highlight the strength, granularity and well-balanced nature of our deposit franchise. In the weekend following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank alone, we opened more new commercial deposit accounts than we would in a typical month. Similarly, our consumer household growth accelerated after the March turmoil.\nOur commercial deposit franchise is led by our peer-leading treasury management business, where we rank in the top 10 nationally in most major commercial payment types. 88% of our commercial deposit balances are attached to relationships that utilize TM services today and the average age of our commercial deposit relationships is 24 years. These characteristics contribute strongly to stability regardless of balance size.\nOur consumer deposit base is granular with nearly 90% of total consumer deposits FDIC insured and is anchored by our flagship mass market momentum banking offering and strong branch presence in the markets we serve. Annual consumer household growth finished the quarter above 3%, led by our Southeast markets above 7%. During the quarter, we opened 5 branches in our Southeast markets on top of the 70 added in the past 3 years, and we expect to open an additional 30 branches by the end of 2023. All said, end-of-period total deposit balances ended the quarter above the level on March 8.\nLooking forward, while we face the same headwinds that all banks do from increased deposit competition, economic uncertainty and the potential for regulatory change, I am confident in Fifth Third's ability to achieve top quartile returns through the cycle with a focus on stability, profitability and growth. Our long-term discipline managing interest rate and liquidity risk positions us well to generate differentiated outcomes in a range of economic environment.\nFrom a credit risk perspective, our low CRE concentration in commercial and, in particular, in office CRE, along with our focus on homeowners and consumer, should prove to be significant advantages. Jamie will provide more information on our forward guidance, but the implied profitability and return metrics for our full year 2023 expectations are well ahead of our core 2019 results. Considering the uncertain environment, we have elected to pause share repurchases for the second quarter, and we'll evaluate resuming them in the second half of the year.\nLast but certainly not least, I want to thank our 20,000 employees for their hard work and dedication in supporting our customers, communities and shareholders. Your commitment to living our purpose and making sure we do the right thing every day is evident.\nWith that, I'll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & Treasurer, Fifth Third Bank\n\nThank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were strong despite the market volatility during the quarter. Average and period end total deposit balances were flat compared to the prior quarter. Average core deposits declined, in line with our earnings of down 1%.\nWe grew loans modestly during the quarter while adding new quality relationships in both commercial and net new households in consumer. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% in a seasonally challenged quarter, which is a 6-point improvement compared to the year ago quarter.\nOur first quarter core PPNR grew nearly 40% compared to last year, reflecting the diversification and growth of our revenue streams, combined with disciplined expense management.\nNet interest income of approximately $1.52 billion increased 27% year-over-year, but declined 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was impacted by our shift to a more defensive balance sheet position, given the volatile environment, the impact of lower day count, and seasonally strong investment portfolio income in the prior quarter.\nFee income exceeded our expectations despite the market-related headwinds and we remain disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest in our businesses. PPNR was impacted by the expenses associated with higher than expected fee income.\nOur NIM declined 6 basis points for the quarter, while interest-bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 176 basis points, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing deposit beta of 36% through the first quarter, which includes the impact of CDs.\nTotal adjusted noninterest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by strength in commercial banking and mortgage fee income, which more than offset a decline in deposit service charges due to the elimination of consumer NSF fees last year and the impact of higher earnings credits from higher market rates this year.\nGrowth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by increased loan syndication, fixed income sales and trading and M&A advisory revenue, partially offset by a decline in corporate bond fees. The improvement in mortgage revenue was driven by increased servicing fees and lower asset decay.\nAdjusted noninterest expense increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter, excluding the impact of nonqualified deferred compensation expenses from both periods. Expense growth was elevated due to the dividend finance acquisition in the second quarter of 2022 and growth in the provide franchise. Excluding the fintech growth impacts and the FDIC assessment, total expenses increased approximately 3% compared to the year ago quarter, as discipline throughout the bank, combined with automation initiatives were offset by compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, higher fee income and higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Commercial was led by C&I, where payoffs were muted and production was stable in our regional middle market banking business but down in our corporate bank. The subdued production in the corporate bank reflects our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment, combined with less robust demand. Compared to a year ago quarter, C&I loans, excluding PPP, have increased 13%.\nThe period-end commercial revolver utilization rate remained stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, led by dividend finance, while balances from the rest of our consumer captions remained relatively stable.\nAverage total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, wealth and asset management average balances increased sequentially, consumer was stable and commercial modestly declined, consistent with normal first quarter seasonality.\nPeriod-end total deposits were also flat compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 1% since the end of last June compared to a 4% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Fed's H8 data. We have included additional materials in our earnings presentation to highlight some of the key attributes of our high-quality deposit franchise that may be relevant in this environment.\nMoving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remained healthy, and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The ratio of early-stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 4 basis points sequentially to 26 basis points and remained about 2019 levels. The net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points increased 4 basis points sequentially and was at the low end of our guidance range. The NPA ratio of 51 basis points was up 2 basis points compared to a year ago.\nFrom a credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high-quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers.\nIn commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE at 14% of total loans. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leverage loan portfolio and office CRE.\nOffice loans of $1.6 billion represented just 1.3% of total loans with a criticized ratio of 8.2% and only 1 basis point of delinquencies, while the leverage loan portfolio has declined 65% since 2016 and is now less than $3 billion outstanding today. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable results through the cycle.\nMoving to the ACL. Our reserve change this quarter was a net increase of $37 million or a build of $86 million, excluding the onetime impact of adopting the accounting standard eliminating TDR accounting, which reduced the reserve by $49 million. Our build primarily reflected loan growth, notably from dividend finance loans, which contributed $88 million of the increase. The ACL ratio increased 1 basis point sequentially or 5 basis points, excluding the accounting change.\nAs you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4% while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios.\nMoving to capital. Our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable compared to last quarter, ending the first quarter at 9.25%. Our capital position reflects our strong earnings generation, offset by the impacts of returning capital in the form of dividends and repurchases, risk-weighted asset growth, primarily in consumer loans, and a 7 basis point decline from the CECL phase-in. Our tangible book value per share increased 11% sequentially, partially impacted by our AOCI position, which improved 17%. Tangible book value grew 7%, excluding AOCI compared to the year ago quarter.\nMoving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loan growth between 2% and 3%, which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low to mid-single digits area compared to 2022, which implies modest incremental growth from the first quarter through year-end given our outlook for a tempered lending environment in the second half of the year. We expect line utilization rates to remain stable.\nWe expect total consumer loan growth to also be modest as a strong increase from dividend finance will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage. We continue to expect approximately $4.5 billion in dividend loan production for the year, given the secular tailwinds and our investments in the business, combined with market share gains.\nWe expect deposits to be stable or grow from the first quarter average level as we progress throughout 2023, consistent with our strong customer acquisition trends. Within that, we expect continued migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from 32% today to 30% by year-end.\nFor the second quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially, with growth fairly balanced between commercial and consumer portfolios. We expect average deposits to also be stable to up 1% on a sequential basis.\nShifting to the income statement. We expect full year NII will increase 7% to 10%. As other banks have noted, industry-wide deposit pricing pressures intensified in the wake of the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures. Therefore, as shown in our presentation materials, we are providing NII guidance under a range of deposit betas, given potential diverging levels of intensity with respect to deposit competition going forward.\nThe upper end of our NII guidance assumes an approximate terminal beta of 43%, and the lower end assumes approximately a 49% terminal beta compared to our January expectation of 42%. The midpoint of our NII outlook translates to a 47% beta with total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 45 basis points or so in the second quarter and another 25 basis points in the second half of the year.\nOur outlook also considers the lag effects from previous rate hikes and continued DDA migration and assumes the Fed hikes 25 basis points in May and then hold short-term rates of 525 basis points for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances declined a couple of billion dollars between now and year-end and that we hold closer to $10 billion in excess cash for most of the year.\nAssuming we continue to defensively position the balance sheet for the remainder of the year by maintaining an elevated excess cash position, combined with continued intense deposit competition, we are assuming NIM will be in the 3.20% to 3.25% range for the year. We expect second quarter NII to be down approximately 1% sequentially, reflecting the deposit loan and cash dynamics I mentioned.\nWe expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable to up 1% in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees, wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be partially offset by higher earnings credit rates on TM, subdued lease remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees, reflecting lower TRA and private equity income this year.\nWe expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. We expect second quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most [ recaptions ] and that will be partially offset by a slowdown in debt capital markets revenue.\nWe continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1. The mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in 2022 expenses and the full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the dividend acquisition, FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up less than 3%.\nOur guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid- to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first quarter, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment.\nWe expect second quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, result in PPNR growth in the 9% to 10% range. This would result in an efficiency ratio below 55% for the full year. We expect second quarter PPNR to increase 10% to 11% compared to the first quarter and for second quarter efficiency ratio to be around 54%.\nWe continue to expect second quarter and full year 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. Given our expected period-end loan growth, including continued strong production from dividend finance, we continue to expect a quarterly build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios.\nIn summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A."

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nChris Doll, Head of Investor Relations at Fifth Third Bancorp, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston, have also joined the Q&A portion of the call.\nPlease review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 19, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nCEO, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to thank our employees for the job they did supporting our customers, communities and shareholders in 2022. You really held true to our core values and our vision to be the one bank people most value and trust.\nJUST Capital and CNBC recently released their annual study of America's Most Just Companies, a comprehensive ranking that recognizes companies who do right by all stakeholders as defined by the American public. Fifth Third ranked 23rd out of the roughly 1,000 companies covered in the study and was the highest ranked category for bank. It's a great achievement. Thank you for it.\nEarlier today, we reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The strength and quality of our franchise are evident in the numbers. We generated record full year revenue of $8.4 billion, up 6% over the prior year. We managed expenses down 1% year-over-year, producing positive operating leverage of 700 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 56%.\nNet charge-offs for the year were below 20 basis points. As a result, we achieved a full year return on tangible common equity ex AOCI of 16.5%, which places us in the top quartile of our peer group.\nJust as importantly, we did what we said we were going to do. We have a culture of accountability at Fifth Third, and it makes me proud that our full year results exceeded the guidance we provided you last January in every major caption, including total revenue, expenses and net charge-offs. As a result, PPNR increased 18% compared to our original guide of 7%.\nWe also made important progress on our growth strategies in 2022. We grew consumer households at a peer-leading organic growth rate of around 2.5% led by our Southeast markets at 7% and surpassed last year's record for new quality relationships in our commercial segment. We opened 18 new branches in the Southeast in 2022, bringing our 3-year total to over 70 new branches in those markets.\nDuring the year, we also made meaningful progress in our technology modernization initiatives and enhanced our peer-leading, digitally-enabled treasury management, managed services and our Momentum Banking product offerings. You may have seen that most recently, we extended Momentum's early pay feature to include income tax refunds.\nOur fintech platforms, Dividend Finance and Provide, continue to scale and achieve top national market shares with Dividend ranking third and Provide ranking second in their respective markets. Our fee-generating businesses are better diversified than most peers and continue to be a key focus for investment.\nStrong performance in our capital markets business related to helping client hedging activities, mortgage servicing and treasury management, all helped to offset market headwinds that all banks faced as did continued net AUM inflows in our Wealth Management business. During 2022, we remain focused on delivering stable long-term results instead of chasing short-term earnings.\nWe maintained our discipline in our credit underwriting with continued focus on granularity and diversification. The outcomes of this are evident in our NPA, NPL and early-stage delinquency ratios, all of which have remained well behaved and well below normalized levels.\nOur balance sheet management approach remains centered on providing strong and stable NII performance across various rate environments. We extended our advantage in our securities yield by waiting to deploy excess liquidity until we were able to earn positive real yields, and we added derivatives to provide hedge protection through 2031. These actions will provide significant long-term benefits in the event of a lower rate environment.\nWith respect to capital, given our strong PPNR growth and benign credit losses, we exceeded our target CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter and resumed share repurchases. Our capital priorities for 2023 are to maintain a 9.25% CET1 ratio and support organic balance sheet growth, pay a strong dividend and continue our share repurchase program.\nWe expect repurchases to steadily increase each quarter for a total of approximately $1 billion during the year. Jamie will provide you with the detail on our financial outlook for 2023, but it is a strong one that is consistent with our priorities of stability, profitability and organic growth.\nWe expect to produce another year of strong revenue growth and operating leverage with full year PPNR growth in the mid- to high teens, a return on tangible common equity ex AOCI exceeding 17% and an efficiency ratio below 53%. We will continue to invest in organic growth and efficiency initiatives.\nWe'll add another 30 to 35 branches in our Southeast markets, including our first 3 in Charleston, South Carolina and several more in the Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina corridor. We'll continue to increase investments in marketing and product innovation to accelerate household growth, and we'll invest in scaling Dividend and Provide.\nLastly, we'll make significant progress on our tech modernization journey and begin to realize savings and improve the client experience by leveraging these investments to drive automation into our most labor-intensive processes. You have my commitment that we will continue to make decisions with the long term in mind to invest where we can strengthen the value and resiliency of our franchise and to hold ourselves accountable for doing what we say we will do.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2023.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our quarterly and full year financial performance reflect focused execution and resiliency throughout the bank. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record revenue.\nNII was positively impacted by higher market rates as deposit repricing has lagged the repricing of our earning assets combined with the benefits of fixed rate asset generation at higher rates. Fee income has remained resilient despite the market-related headwinds, and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses.\nWe achieved a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of 56%, which improved throughout the year with the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio below 52%. Our fourth quarter PPNR grew 12% compared to last quarter and 40% compared to last year.\nNet interest income of approximately $1.6 billion was a record for the bank and increased 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our NIM expanded 13 basis points for the quarter, while interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 105 basis points, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 24% in the fourth quarter.\nTotal noninterest income increased 9% sequentially driven by our TRA revenue and commercial banking fees. That growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by higher M&A advisory revenue and client financial risk management revenue. And it was partially offset by softer results in mortgage banking origination fees.\nNoninterest expense increased just 1% compared to the year-ago quarter. This expense growth was driven by our acquisition of Dividend Finance during the year combined with continued investments in Provide, compensation associated with our minimum wage hike as well as higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Excluding the impacts of Dividend and Provide, total expenses would have been down 1% year-over-year.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in C&I balances. Growth was led by our corporate bank and robust in almost all of our industry verticals.\nAmong our verticals, production was strongest in energy, including renewables, which increased over 50% year-over-year. Health care growth was led by Provide with Provide balances up 150% year-over-year. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate remained stable compared to last quarter at 37%.\nAverage total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter led by Dividend Finance as well as growth in home equity. This was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans.\nAverage total deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter as an increase in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. Period-end deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. After the deliberate runoff of surge deposits in the middle of the year, we have achieved solid deposit outcomes throughout the second half of 2022, reflecting our strong core deposit franchise.\nMoving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy, and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The NPA ratio of 44 basis points was down 2 basis points sequentially, and our commercial NPA ratio has now declined for 9 consecutive quarters. The net charge-off ratio increased just 1 basis point sequentially to 22 basis points within our guidance range. The ratio of early-stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due also increased only 2 basis points sequentially and remains below 2019 levels.\nFrom a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high-quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We also have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in non-prime consumer borrowers among our peers.\nIn commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office CRE.\nWe have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our investment portfolio positioning and our cash flow hedge portfolios will provide protection against lower rates well beyond just the next few years as well as the addition of the fixed rate lending capabilities from both Dividend and Provide should continue to support our strong through-the-cycle outcomes.\nMoving to the ACL. Our ACL build this quarter was $112 million primarily reflecting loan growth. Dividend Finance loans contributed $96 million to the ACL build. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.2% while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%.\nGiven our expected period-end loan growth, including continued strong production from Dividend Finance, we currently expect a first quarter build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios.\nMoving to capital. Our CET1 grew from 9.1% to 9.3% during the quarter. The increase in capital reflects our strong earnings generation, which was partially offset by the impact of a $100 million share repurchase completed in December.\nMoving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loan growth between 3% and 4% compared to 2022. We expect most of the growth to come from the commercial loan portfolio, which is expected to increase in the mid-single digits in 2023.\nWe expect line utilization to be stable in the first half of 2023 but then decline slightly to 36% as capital markets conditions improve a bit in the second half of the year. We expect total consumer loans to increase modestly as an expected increase from Dividend Finance and modest growth from home equity and card will be mostly offset by decline in auto and mortgage, reflecting the environment.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable sequentially. We expect commercial loans to increase 1%, reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain generally stable. We expect consumer balances to be stable to down 1%, reflecting lower auto and residential mortgage balances, partially offset by dividend loan originations of $1 billion or so in the first quarter.\nFrom a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to be stable to down 8% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors before resuming modest growth in the subsequent quarters of 2023. We expect continued migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits ending the year in the low 30s.\nShifting to the income statement. Given our loan outlook and the benefits of our balance sheet management, we expect full year NII to increase 13% to 14%. Our forecast assumes our securities portfolio remains relatively stable from the second half of 2022 levels and reflects the forward curve as of early January with Fed funds increasing to 5% in the first quarter and the first 25 basis point rate cut occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur current outlook assumes total interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 112 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022, to increase in the first half of 2023 before settling in around 2% or so in the second half of 2023. Our outlook contemplates an environment of continued deposit competition which would result in a cumulative deposit beta by the end of 2023 of around 42%, given the 2 additional rate hikes in our forecast over our October guidance.\nThe future impacts of deposit-repricing lags combined with the dynamics of our loan portfolio should result in our full year 2023 net interest margin increasing 5 basis points or so relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 NIM. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 1% to 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of a lower day count in the quarter combined with stable loan balances.\nWe expect adjusted noninterest income to be relatively stable in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees, wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be offset by the market headwinds impacting top-line mortgage revenue and higher earnings credit rates on treasury management as well as subdued leasing remarketing revenue.\nIf capital markets conditions do not improve, we would expect to generate improved NII and lowered expenses in the second half of 2023. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023.\nOur guidance also assumes a minimal amount of private equity income in 2023 compared to around $70 million in the prior year. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors.\nAdditionally, we expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by a slowdown in M&A advisory revenue and the impact of higher earnings credits and softer top-line mortgage banking revenue, given the rate environment. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022.\nOur expense outlook includes a 1 point headwind each from the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1; the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which was a reduction in 2022 expenses; and the full year expense impact of Dividend Finance. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10%, consistent with the past several years.\nWe also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single digits area. Our outlook assumes we close 25 branches in the first half of 2023 that will deliver in-year expense savings and also add 30 to 35 new branches in our high-growth markets, which will result in high single-digit growth of our Southeast branch network.\nWe expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal expenses associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, expenses will be down approximately 2% in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 9% to 10%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 15% to 17% range. This would result in a sub-53% efficiency ratio for the full year, a 3-point improvement from 2022.\nWe expect 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range with first quarter net charge-offs in the 25 to 30 basis point range.\nIn summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator, please open the call up for Q&A."

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. .\nOur Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 20, 2022, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nCEO, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we turn to our financial results, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies for all those across the state of Florida who are impacted by Hurricane Ian. I would also like to thank our employees for answering the call to take care of our customers and communities in the state.\nIn the days since the hurricane made landfall, our employees have made nearly 90,000 customer wellness calls, reopened all our branches and staffed Fifth Third financial empowerment [bus] to enable customers who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. For those of you listening today, your resilience in the face of this natural disaster is awe inspiring. Thank you for living our core values.\nTurning to the financials. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results that reflect our commitment to strong performance business cycle. We generated record adjusted revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Credit quality remained strong, reflected in charge-offs at the low end of our previous guidance. We also generated 10 points of positive operating leverage compared to the year ago quarter and achieved one of our lowest adjusted efficiency ratios over the past decade at 53%.\nMost all of our core return measures remain in the top quartile among peers, including an ROA of approximately 1.3% and an ROTCE, excluding AOCI of, nearly 18%. We also produced strong organic growth during the quarter, sustaining a record pace in adding new quality relationships in commercial and growing new households by 3% across our footprint and consumer.\nOur 2 recent fintech acquisitions, Dividend and Provide, each achieved record quarterly origination levels. Turning to the balance sheet. Loan growth was solid across our franchise. Our commercial loan production remains well diversified and supported by the bank's strategic investments. Within our regions, loan production in our Southeast and other expansion markets roughly equaled our Midwest markets. Among our verticals, new production was strongest in energy, including renewables, with a 70% increase in origination volume compared to the year ago quarter.\nSmall business production was led by Provide, which doubled year-over-year. Average consumer loans were up 1% led by Dividend Finance, a top 5 national residential solar lender, and a return to growth in home equity. Dividend recently announced several key national partnerships, which will continue to accelerate growth in the future.\nSwitching to deposits. Consistent with prior guidance, our third quarter end-of-period balances were stable, with average balances down nearly $5 billion due primarily to the full quarter impact of our delivered exits in the second quarter. In consumer, we grew households 3% year-over-year led by our Southeast markets, which grew 8%. We generated consumer transaction balance growth of 5% compared to last year and opened a 1 millionth Momentum Banking account in the quarter.\nIn commercial, our deposit franchise is anchored by our peer-leading treasury management business. We ranked #2 through #9 nationally in most TM payment types as shown in EY's annual cash management survey. We have a strong deposit base and new relationship growth engines in both our consumer and commercial business lines, and we expect the positive production momentum that we built during the third quarter to produce growth in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to the income statement. The strength and diversification of our fee-based businesses throughout the bank has helped to partially offset the market headwinds all banks are experiencing. In commercial, our gross treasury management revenue increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter, led by our Expert AR and Expert AP solutions.\nOur capital markets revenue associated with helping clients (inaudible) exposure to rates, commodities and foreign exchange increased 30% compared to the year ago quarter. In consumer, we generated strong mortgage revenue growth this quarter in an otherwise challenging environment, thanks to the strength of our mortgage servicing operation.\nFifth Third is a low-cost, high-quality servicer, one of the only banks to be recognized as both a Fannie Mae STAR servicer and a HUD grade A servicer. The actions we took to grow our MSR portfolio nearly 30% since the end of 2019 will continue to pay dividends going forward. Finally, in Wealth Management, excluding tax payments, we have generated positive AUM inflows in every one of the past 13 quarters, and we will recognize this quarter as the best private bank for high net worth clients by the Digital Banker and Global Private Banker magazine.\nWe continue to focus on maintaining our culture of prudent expense management across the company, while investing in organic growth and tech modernization initiatives. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress in our technology and platform modernization journey. We successfully migrated our core platforms to a new data center and have now virtualized over 90% of our servers, strengthening network resiliency, increasing speed and capacity and improving the experience for both our customers and employees.\nIn the fourth quarter, we'll relaunch our mobile app and a new cloud-based architecture and with several improvements to the user experience. Credit quality remains strong throughout the bank. Our charge-off ratio was 21 basis points for the quarter, and our nonperforming asset ratio declined compared to the prior quarter. We remain cautious with respect to the broader economy given persistent inflation, the Fed's aggressive monetary policies and global growth concerns. We've continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality relationships and companies with more diversified resilient business models.\nWe continue to proactively monitor our portfolio for signs of potential stress. And regardless of what comes, I'm confident in our ability to outperform peers through the full economic cycle. With respect to capital, we announced a 10% increase to the quarterly common dividend in September. We continue to accrete capital with strong PPNR growth and expect to achieve a 9.25% CET1 by year-end. We also expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023, subject to economic conditions.\nWe continue to make decisions with the long term in mind, hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do and invest in product and service innovations that generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our third quarter financial results and our current outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record adjusted revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates, fee income was resilient despite the market-related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses.\nConsequently, we achieved a 53% adjusted efficiency ratio. Also, excluding net securities losses related to 2 legacy venture capital investments, we generated core PPNR growth of 13% compared to last quarter and 27% compared to last year. Net interest income was approximately $1.5 billion, a record quarter and increased 12% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, primarily attributable to the benefit of higher market rates, growth in commercial loan balances and the full quarter benefit of securities purchased in the second quarter.\nOur NIM expanded 30 basis points during the quarter while interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 32 basis points to 41 basis points in total this quarter. This equates to a cycle-to-date deposit beta of 16% thus far on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes. Total reported noninterest income decreased just 1% sequentially.\nWe generated improved mortgage banking and leasing business fee income, which was offset by softer results in market-sensitive businesses, including capital markets and the impact of higher earnings credit rates in treasury management. Noninterest expense increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, including the impact of the July minimal wage increase to $20 per hour, higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on technology modernization initiatives and the full quarter impact of the dividend finance acquisition.\nExpenses in the quarter included a $7 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of nonqualified deferred compensation with a corresponding offset in securities losses. This compares to a $27 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the NQDC impacts from both periods, total noninterest expense increased $35 million or 3%.\nNoninterest expense was flat compared to the year ago quarter despite the impacts of our fintech lending acquisitions of both Dividend and Provide. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 2% sequentially, including held-for-sale loans. Total average loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter.\nWith muted payoffs and a stable revolver utilization rate of 37%, period end commercial loans increased 1% sequentially and 14% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven by Dividend Finance, which, as a reminder, is recorded in other consumer loans as well as growth in residential mortgage.\nThis growth was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. At quarter end, Dividend loan balances were approximately $1.4 billion. Average core deposits decreased 3% compared to both the year-ago quarter and the prior quarter, impacted by the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits in the second quarter and lower consumer interest checking balances in the third quarter.\nCompared to the year-ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 10%, while average consumer transaction deposits increased 5%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We grew our securities portfolio approximately $1 billion during the third quarter compared to $6 billion in the prior quarter.\nWe currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on maintaining structure in the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures at quarter end remained at 67% and our duration declined to 5.5% in the current quarter compared to 5.8% in the prior quarter.\nMoving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy, and our key credit metrics remain well below normalized levels. The NPA ratio of 46 basis points was down 1 basis point sequentially. Our commercial NPA ratio has now declined for 8 consecutive quarters. The net charge-off ratio was flat sequentially at 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due remained relatively stable sequentially, and the amount of loans 90 days past due was approximately 2/3 of what it was a year ago.\nWe continue to closely monitor central business district hotels, nonprofit health care, including senior living and office CRE. We are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leveraged loan portfolio. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality commercial relationships and on homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio.\nWe maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in both commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers. Through the Dividend and Provide acquisitions, we added granular fixed rate loan origination platforms. We have also focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our securities and cash flow hedge portfolios as well as the additions of Dividend and Provide lending capabilities should continue to position us to drive strong outcomes.\nIn the cash flow hedge portfolio, we have added an incremental $5 billion since the end of the second quarter, bringing the total cash flow hedges added this year to $15 billion. The combined securities and cash flow hedge positions will support NII through the end of the decade. Moving to the ACL. Our ACL build this quarter was $96 million, primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a slightly worsening economic outlook relative to June.\nDividend finance loan growth contributed $63 million to this ACL build. Relative to the second quarter, the Moody's GDP growth forecasts are slightly stronger, while the unemployment and home price forecast have weakened in both the baseline and downside scenarios. Given our expected period-end loan growth, including stronger production from Dividend Finance, we currently expect a fourth quarter build to the ACL of approximately $100 million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios.\nThe impact of the expected dividend loan originations to the ACL should be in the $80 million to $90 million range due to our improved loan growth expectations. Our economic scenarios incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains, including continued aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated.\nOur September 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Future baseline unemployment estimates may begin to be increasingly impacted by the Fed's aggressive monetary policies. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.1% compared to 9% in the quarter. The increase in capital was primarily due to our strong earnings capacity, partially offset by RWA growth, reflecting robust organic business opportunities.\nMoving to our current outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially. We expect commercial loans to grow 1% reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remained stable at 37%.\nWe expect consumer balances to be stable down 1%, reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital and lower residential mortgage balances, partially offset by dividend loan originations of around $1 billion in the fourth quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to increase 1% to 2% sequentially. However, we do expect some continued migration from DDA into interest-bearing products. Wholesale funding balances should be stable given expected core deposit growth relative to our earning asset base.\nShifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue growth of 6% compared to the third quarter, excluding the third quarter security losses associated with legacy venture equity investments. We expect NII to be up approximately 5% sequentially, assuming a 75 basis point hike in November and another 50 basis points in December.\nWe expect a cumulative deposit beta of around 30% by year-end. This should result in interest-bearing core deposit costs rising from 41 basis points in the third quarter to the mid- to high 90 basis point area for the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up 6% to 7% compared to the third quarter or stable, excluding the impacts of the TRA.\nWe have a strong M&A advisory pipeline and expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue, given the rate environment. We expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued investments in talent, technology and our Southeast branch expansion. Our guidance assumes we opened 17 new branches, 16 of which will be in our high-growth Southeast markets.\nOur fourth quarter guide implies stable expenses for 2022 on a full year basis compared to 2021 and 8% adjusted revenue growth, excluding securities losses, resulting in PPNR growth in the high teens. This will result in a mid-50s efficiency ratio for the full year, a 4-point improvement from 2021 and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio in the 51% to 52% range. We expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range, which will result in full year net charge-offs of approximately 20 basis points.\nIn summary, with our PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A."

My name is Rex, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston, have also joined for the Q&A portion of the call.\nPlease review the cautionary statements on materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding to the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 21, 2022 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nCEO, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. With this being my first earnings call as CEO, I'd like to say what an honor it is to follow a great leader like Greg Carmichael.\nLet's jump right in. Earlier today, we reported a solid second quarter, reflecting our focus on profitability, organic growth and through the cycle returns. We generated record adjusted revenue and maintained our expense discipline, producing adjusted PPNR growth of 11% compared to last year. We extended our track record for strong organic growth, adding new quality relationships in commercial and new households in consumer, and both our recent acquisitions, dividend financed and provide achieved record originations. Charge-offs remained low, NPA is in early-stage delinquencies improved sequentially, and we saw no decline in the liquidity buffers that our consumer households built during the pandemic.\nWith that said, there is no question in my mind that the economic outlook is blurrier today than it was at the start of the year. Due to the potential forward economic challenges, we are maintaining a prudently cautious view on credit as reflected in our reserve coverage.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Loan growth was solid and diversified across our franchise. Average commercial loan growth was driven by C&I, which included a 1% increase in utilization on revolving lines of credit. We generated robust loan growth in nearly all our corporate banking verticals and our Chicago, Cincinnati, North and South Carolina and Florida regions led the way in middle market lending.\nAverage consumer loans grew in almost all categories. Our results include a small benefit from our mid-May closing of dividend finance. We're very excited about dividend as the rising energy costs and the trend of homeowners improving their existing homes versus trading up only enhances our market opportunity.\nSwitching to deposits. Our second quarter results were in line with our prior commentary with average balances intentionally down $6 billion sequentially and stable from the prior year as we focus on margins over volume given our overall liquidity position. We have a very strong deposit base with a higher allocation of consumer deposits in the stable retail category than any institution that reports as part of the LCR rule. Consumer transaction deposits grew 1% sequentially and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued growth in Momentum Banking and double-digit deposit balance growth in our Southeast markets.\nCommercial transaction deposits were down sequentially, partially reflecting the anticipated movement of excess balances to higher-yielding alternatives combined with some seasonal impacts. As of yesterday, total deposit balances have remained stable since mid-May despite the Fed rate hikes that occurred late in the second quarter.\nAs a result of our loan growth and deposit pricing discipline, net interest income increased 12% sequentially or 15%, excluding the impact of PPP, Ginnie Mae in the securities prepayment penalty income. As we indicated in the investor conference last month, fees were softer for the quarter, reflecting the impact of market conditions on debt capital markets, mortgage and wealth management.\nI am, however, quite pleased with the strength and diversification of our underlying fee growth engines. In payments, our gross treasury management revenue increased 7% and credit card spend grew 10%, both compared to a year ago quarter. In Capital Markets, Financial risk management revenue increased 18% and M&A advisory revenue grew 30%, the majority of which was sourced from existing middle-market relationships. In Wealth Management, despite the market volatility, personal asset management revenue was up 3% year-to-date, and we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of positive net AUM flows -- we continue to manage expenses very diligently throughout the bank, reflecting our multiyear continuous improvement discipline, which has funded a significant portion of our organic growth and tech monetization strategies.\nLooking forward, our proactive actions over the past several years with respect to our minimum wage and other employee retention strategy should provide us a buffer against inflation relative to peers. With respect to capital, we recently announced our 2.5% stress capital buffer requirement from the Fed stress test exercise, the minimum under the regulatory capital rules. Our top priorities for capital deployment remain funding organic growth and paying a strong dividend. We recently announced our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by up to $0.03 in September, subject to Board approval and economic conditions. Given our robust loan growth and our desire to run the bank slightly above our capital targets in the current environment, we do not anticipate executing share repurchases for the remainder of the year at this time.\nWhile credit quality remains benign, we remain cautious on the impact of the Fed's continued aggressive monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics could have on the economy. Over the past several years, we have built Fifth Third to be resilient and to produce strong results under any market environment. We have been consistent with our strategic priorities and have had the discipline to fund investments in geographic expansion, product innovation and technology through continuous improvement and pruning noncore businesses.\nWe have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality commercial relationships and on homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintain the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in commercial real estate and the non-prime borrowers among our peers and 93% of the mortgages on our balance sheet are fixed rate.\nWe have protected NII through a series of actions, including our securities portfolio positioning, adding cash flow hedges to protect the down rate scenario for the next decade, and by maintaining a strong deposit franchise with a focus on primary relationships.\nThrough the dividend and provide acquisitions, we added fixed rate loan origination platforms that will be especially powerful in a lower rate environment. Our allowance for credit losses provides greater loss absorbency than virtually any of our peers. Under my leadership, you should expect us to continue to make decisions with the long term in mind to hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do and to invest in product and service innovations that generate sustainable long-term value for customers and shareholders alike.\nIn closing, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to say thank you to our employees who are listening today. As you know, banks can have a special place in the communities where they operate, and with that comes a special responsibility to be a proponent for positive change.\nYou work hard every day to live our purpose, including delivering 8 million meals to fight hunger across our footprint as part of Fifth Third day as well as positioning us to achieve our new $100 billion environmental and social finance commitment. I also want to thank you for the myriad of small things you do every day to improve our customers' lives.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and our current outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and remain disciplined in managing our deposit costs. Expenses were once again well controlled even though we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Fees did underperform our April expectations due to the market volatility, but even with that softness, we generated core PPNR growth of 11% on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we achieved a sub-55% efficiency ratio and generated 7 points (sic) [4 points] of positive operating leverage from the second quarter of 2021. The ACL ratio increased 5 basis points sequentially to 1.85%, which includes a 4 basis point impact from the Dividend Finance acquisition.\nCombined with $62 million in net charge-offs, we recorded a $179 million total provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.3 billion increased 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. As Tim mentioned, the underlying NII growth was around 15% compared to last quarter, of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to higher market rates and half from the combination of investment portfolio growth and loan growth, primarily in C&I. Our interest-bearing core deposit costs were well controlled at just 9 basis points this quarter, up just 5 basis points sequentially and helped drive the 33 basis points of NIM expansion during the quarter. Total reported noninterest income decreased 1% sequentially and increased 3% on an adjusted basis.\nCompared to the prior quarter, we generated improved financial risk management, card and processing gross treasury management fees and private equity income, which was partially offset by weaker performance from our market-sensitive businesses, including commercial capital markets and mortgage and the impact of higher treasury management earnings credit rates. Noninterest expense decreased 9% compared to the prior quarter driven by a decline in compensation and benefits expense from the seasonal peak in the first quarter, lower incentive-based comp in the current quarter due to market dynamics that impacted fees and overall continued expense discipline throughout the company. Expenses in the quarter included a $27 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of nonqualified deferred compensation, which has a corresponding offset in security losses. This compares to a $12 million benefit in the prior quarter.\nExcluding the nonqualified deferred compensation impacts from both periods, total noninterest expense decreased $95 million or 8%. Non-interest expense decreased 4% compared to the year ago quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Including held-for-sale loans, total average loans increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 4% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Commercial loan production remained robust throughout the franchise, outperforming our original expectations.\nOur production and pipelines are the result of our strategic investments in talent as we continue to see strength in new quality relationship generation during the second quarter, with muted payoffs and a 1% increase in the revolver utilization rate to 37%. Period-end commercial loans increased 3% sequentially and 12% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 3% compared to the prior quarter, driven by residential mortgage and the dividend acquisition, which are recorded in other consumer loans. This growth was partially offset by a decline in home equity. At quarter end, total dividend loan balances were $650 million, reflecting our decision to hold some loans for dividend would have otherwise sold combined with their post-close production volume.\nAverage core deposits were stable compared to the year ago quarter and decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter including the impact of the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits. This runoff was in line with our expectations and reflects our pricing discipline from our strong overall liquidity position.\nCompared to the year-ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 8% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 1%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. Given the improved entry points during the first and second quarters, we deployed cash into the securities portfolio, which resulted in second quarter average securities balance growth of approximately $12 billion. We completed net purchases of $6 billion in securities during the second quarter compared to $13 billion in the prior quarter. The higher than previously expected security purchases in the second quarter were the result of accelerating planned second half of 2022 purchases given the attractive entry points in late May and June. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on adding duration and structure to the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows.\nConsequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures increased from 64% to 67% at quarter end, and our duration increased from 5.4% to 5.7%.\nMoving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit remained healthy and in line with our previous expectations. The NPA ratio of 47 basis points improved 2 basis points sequentially, with net charge-offs of just 21 basis points. The ratio of early-stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due relative to loans was stable in the second quarter and the amount of loans 90 days past due is less than half of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor the same areas we have previously discussed, such as Central Business District hotels, Senior Living and Office CRE.\nWe are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cost stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leveraged loan portfolio.\nOur ACL build this quarter was $117 million, of which approximately 75% was from strong loan growth, including the $53 million ACL impact from the dividend acquisition, and the remaining 25% was attributable to worsening economic projections relative to March, net of reductions in certain pandemic-related qualitative adjustments. Given the incremental clarity on the economy's ability to withstand geopolitical tensions and the pandemic fallout with vaccine efficacy and other measures. We elected to return to our standard approach for scenario weights of 80% to the baseline and 10% due to the downside and upside scenarios.\nWe believe our models are better suited to appropriately evaluate economic scenarios and outcomes from monetary tightening on our loan portfolio than on humanitarian crises such as pandemics and wars. Despite the scenario weight change, we increased our reserves in specific portfolios such as CRE, where we continue to believe there are elevated risks. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains relatively stable with unemployment ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%, which is slightly weaker than our previous estimate. Additionally, GDP growth and home price forecasts have weakened relative to our March forecast in both our baseline and downside scenarios.\nOur expectations incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains, including aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our June 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment.\nMoving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9% compared to 9.3% in the prior quarter. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth, reflecting robust organic business opportunities and the impact of the dividend Finance acquisition. We expect to accrete capital to the 9.25% area by year-end given our strong earnings capacity, and we will evaluate resuming buybacks after that time.\nMoving to our current outlook. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 or around 10%, excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae impacts, reflecting strong pipelines and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year.\nDividend finance is generating strong origination volumes. We expect loan originations of around $1.3 billion in the second half of 2022, which is 30% more than our original estimates. Similarly, provide loan production remained strong as we expect over $1 billion in total production in 2022. Dividend and provide together are expected to contribute a little more than 1% of the total average loan growth for the year. We expect average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% or 14% to 15%, excluding PPP. We expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital.\nWe expect around $7 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year which will still result in double-digit growth in average indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes growth of approximately 15% in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of dividend finance.\nShifting to the income statement. We continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of 7% to 8%, which will be a record year of revenue for Fifth.\nThird. Given our outlook for earning asset growth, combined with the implied forward curve as of July 1, which assumes a Fed funds rate of 3.25% by year-end, we expect full year NII to increase 17% to 18%. Our outlook incorporates the impacts from runoff of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would be around 20%. Our current outlook assumes average deposit balances declined a couple of billion dollars in the third quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the second quarter runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits and seasonality and then return to growth in the fourth quarter.\nSince the onset of the rate hikes, our deposit betas have been muted at low single digits for the cycle to date. We expect increases to our interest-bearing core deposit costs to accelerate over the next 2 quarters due to the timing impact of deposit repricing lags from earlier hikes and continued aggressive rate hikes from the Fed. We continue to expect a 25% deposit beta on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes and a marginal beta of around 45% to 50% on the next 75 basis points of rate hikes.\nThe ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be down 7% to 8% in 2022, reflecting softer second quarter performance, combined with the high probability of continued market volatility, reflecting a more aggressive rate outlook, including lower wealth and asset management, mortgage and capital markets revenue as well as higher earnings credit rates offsetting strong gross treasury management fee growth.\nDespite the expected decline in capital markets revenue, we expect full year capital markets revenue to be up nearly 50% from the pre-pandemic 2019 levels, which highlights the success we've had over the past few years in growing a diversified capital markets business. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense, including the impacts of dividend finance to be stable to down 1% compared to 2021, an improvement from our previous guide of up 1% to 2%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we had 20 to 25 new branches, primarily in our high-growth Southeast markets in 2022.\nOur guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that went into effect on July 4. We expect these investments in our people, platforms and franchise to be offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given our LaSalle solution sale and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth, combined with our expense outlook, should generate 4 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage of around 8%.\nFull year adjusted PPNR growth is expected to be 17% to 19%, which is an improvement to the range compared to our April estimate, reflecting the strong NII and expense outcomes, partially offset by the market-related fee headwinds. Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects the benefits of our ability to grow our customer base, combined with our strong balance sheet management and expense discipline.\nFor the third quarter of 2022, we expect average total loan balances to increase 1% sequentially, reflecting 1% to 2% growth in commercial and stable consumer balances. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase $2 billion to $3 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during the second quarter. Shifting to the income statement. We expect third quarter adjusted revenue growth of 8% to 9% compared with the second quarter. We expect NII to be up 11% to 12% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our balance sheet positioning.\nWe expect adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to the second quarter or up 2% compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of Provide and Dividend Finance. Excluding the second quarter, NQDC benefits on expenses, we expect noninterest expenses to increase around 2% sequentially.\nWe continue to expect third quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range. In summary, with our balance sheet positioning, PPNR growth engine and discipline credit risk management, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong performance in this type of environment.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A."

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.\nThis morning, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Greg Carmichael; President, Tim Spence; CFO, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.\n\nGregory D. Carmichael\n\nChairman & CEO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $494 million or $0.68 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.02 impact from the VAT return swap the mark-to-market impact of our Avid Exchange Holdings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.70 per share. For the quarter, we generated strong loan growth, including average C&I growth of 8%, excluding PPP. We grew core deposits once again, with strength in consumer transaction deposits of 4%, reflecting our success generating quality house growth, which increased 3% on a year-over-year basis.\nWe also took advantage of attractive market entry points for deploying our excess cash and grew our securities portfolio by approximately $5 billion on an average basis. As a result of our interest earning asset growth, net interest income increased 1% sequentially, excluding PPP. We had yet another quarter of benign credit quality, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting. This resulted in near record low charge-off of just 12 basis points.\nIn addition to our Mutic credit losses, NPA remained stable, and our commercial cross-sold assets continue to improve. As many of you saw last week, I announced my plan to retire as CEO and transition to Executive Chairman, effective July 5. As part of our thorough succession planning process, I'm excited and proud to announce the Board has unamously appointed Tim Spence to succeed me as our next CEO. I believe this is the right time for a transition, given Fifth Third's tremendous financial health and performance.\nShareholders (inaudible) Fifth Third for a while, know that when I became CEO, I made a commitment that we would generate strong financial results and performed well through the various business cycles. We form in our plans on a project North Star, we articulated several key strategic priorities to generate strong and sustainable long-term financial results, including optimizing our balance sheet, differentiating our customer experience, growing and diversifying our fee revenues, building on our legacy of digital innovation and maintaining expense discipline.\nI am very proud of what we achieved. We transformed our approach to credit risk management, centralizing credit underwriting with geographic sector and product level concentration limits. We exited commercial relationships that had a skewed risk return profile totaling $7 billion, focusing on high-quality relationships with a more diversified and resilient businesses. We deliberately reduced our leverage lending exposure, down more than 6% since 2015.\nWe remain cautious with respect to our CRE portfolio with the lowest CRE as a prestage of capital among peers. We maintained our expense discipline, taking actions when necessary, including exiting noncore businesses, which allowed us to prioritize our investments in areas of strategic importance. We invested heavily in our treasury management systems, shifting our focus to building managed service platforms. As a result, we now have the highest TM fees as a percentage of revenue and commitments and we are the fastest growing among our peers.\nWe made significant investments in technology to improve our resiliency and better serve our customers. We build a consumer business that has consistently added households far in excess of our peers in the U.S. average while also taking our customers' satisfaction scores from below peer medium in 2015 to top quartile today. We grew market share organically in the Southeast and West Coast and established a leading position in Chicago through the strategic acquisition of MB Financial.\nWe also invested in strategic nonbank acquisitions like provide dividend, Coker Capital, H2C, Franklin Street and more to accelerate growth and broaden our capabilities. We structure our securities portfolio to generate stable predictable cash flows that has allowed us to extend our earnings advantage versus peers. And we focus on generating sustainable value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees and communities.\nFrom day 1, my focus was to build a franchise that would perform well through the cycle while generating consistent and quality earnings quarter after quarter, year after year. While some of these decisions impact the near-term profitability at the time, all of these proof points highlight the actions we have taken over the past 7 years to improve Fifth Third and set us up for long-term outperformers through various business cycles.\nFurthermore, we expect our intentionally asset-sensitive balance sheet to perform extremely relative to peers in this rate environment. With the revenue benefits of higher rates are obvious, we are mindful that there are likely to be elevated risk in the overall U.S. economy if the Fed aggressively tightens monetary policy to curb inflation, combined with the existing supply chain constraints and labor shortages. However, because of our actions and positioning, Fifth Third is as strong as ever and well positioned for long-term outperformance.\nI would just like to say that being the CEO of Fifth Third has been an honor of a lifetime. I'm grateful for the support of the Board and all of our employees, and I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. Fifth Third is in great shape, and Tim is well prepared to leave Fifth Third into the future. Tim is outstanding and visionary leader. He's been an integral part of Fifth Third leadership team since 2015, helping develop strategies and vision that we are executing with excellence through innovation and technology.\nBefore I hand over to Tim, so this is my 29th and final quarterly earnings call. I can also say that I have enjoyed almost all of these discussions about our financial performance and outlook with the investor community. I want to say thank you for your confidence that you have given me for my tenure. I also want to thank our entire leadership team. I have been extremely fortunate to work with such a great seasoned team, which I believe is the best in the industry. What we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable. Thank you. I know that on Tim's leadership, you will continue to do great things, inspire others and improve the lives of our customers and well-being of our communities. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy N. Spence\n\nPresident, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nGood morning to you all. Thank you, Greg, for the kind words. I'm honored to serve ice Fifth Third's next CEO and to follow on the footsteps of an incredible leader like you. I could not be more excited about Fifth Third's future. Given my role in the company over the past several years and the strength of our performance, you should expect continuity in our strategic focus areas and in how we run the bank. We will maintain our operational focus, expense discipline and culture of accountability to produce consistent financial results while investing for the future. We will continue to anticipate and respond proactively to demand shifts and new competitive threats, consistent with the actions you have seen us take over the past several years, including our deliberate multiyear reduction in punitive consumer fees before it became an industry topic; the rollout of our award-winning momentum banking product suite, which is unparalleled among peers; our differentiated digitally enabled treasury management services to automate accounts payable and receivable launched well before the pandemic.\nPartnerships and acquisitions of fintech platforms like Provide and dividend finance that create national scale and a best-in-class customer experience and our focus on financing renewable energy well before ESG became a mainstream term. More broadly, we will remain mindful of the long-term structural shifts taking place, such as the evolving geopolitical environment, population aging, government debt levels and central bank tightening that will create winners and losers over the next decade.\nNo one knows for sure what the world will look like 10 years from now. But as prudent risk managers, we are always contemplating the many potential tail risks as well as positioning the bank to take advantage of potential business opportunities that will arise. We will also be steadfast in our belief that we are most successful when we take care of all our stakeholders. To that end, yesterday, we announced that we are increasing our minimum wage to $20 an hour across our footprint and that concurrently, we will provide a midyear wage increase to employees in our first 4 job bands. We are taking these actions despite having best-in-class employee retention according to leading research because we recognize that rising costs throughout the economy have a disproportionate impact on our frontline employees who are the face of Fifth Third.\nIn total, more than 40% of our workforce will benefit from these increases, including 95% of our retail branch and operations employees. It is simply the right thing to do. In the short term, this will result in roughly $18 million in incremental annualized expenses. However, as we have seen with our 2 previous wage increases, we fully expect to achieve stronger financial outcomes from lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training. As Greg mentioned, our balance sheet and earnings power are extremely strong. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to favor organic growth, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities such as provide and dividend finance, paying a strong dividend and then share repurchases.\nPractically speaking, given our robust loan growth, we currently anticipate resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2022. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I would like to say thank you to our employees. I'm very proud that in addition to producing solid financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I also hope you all feel the same sense of pride that I do in being part of an organization that was just named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, 1 of just 5 banks globally. Fifth Third is a great company because we have great people who live our core values every day. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were solid despite the market volatility during the quarter. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and grew deposits. Expenses were once again well controlled, but fees underperformed our January expectations due to the market environment.\nImprovements in credit quality resulted in an ACL ratio of 180 basis points compared to 185 basis points last quarter while an increase in loan balances resulted in a net $11 million increase to our credit reserves. Combined with another quarter muted net charge-offs, we had a $45 million total provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion was stable sequentially. Reported results were impacted by lower day count, lower PPP income, including a slowdown in forgiveness that resulted in $10 million less than expected PPP-related NII and and the expected decline in residential mortgage balances from previous Ginnie Mae purchases.\nThese detriments were offset by the benefit from the deployment of excess liquidity into securities, strong loan growth and the impact of higher market rates. Excluding PPP, NII increased 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Total reported noninterest income decreased 9% compared to the year ago quarter or 7% on an adjusted basis. Similar to peers, our results were impacted by lower capital markets revenue, primarily due to transaction delays as well as lower mortgage revenue in light of lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins, partially offset by improving MSR asset decay. We generated solid year-over-year fee growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management, where we produced net AUM inflows again this quarter. Consumer deposit fees were stable as our success generating household growth offset the continued decline in cumulative consumer fees as part of our Momentum banking offering.\nNoninterest expenses increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting continued discipline throughout the company. Compensation expenses were well controlled, with the year-over-year increase reflecting the previously announced broad-based restricted equity awards, which will support the continuation of our strong employee retention. We also continue to invest in the ongoing modernization of our tech platforms. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to 2021's contract renegotiations. Adjusted expenses increased 2% sequentially, driven by the special equity award and the usual seasonal increase in compensation and benefits expense.\nOur expenses this quarter included a mark-to-market benefit associated with nonqualified deferred compensation plans of $12 million with a corresponding offset in securities losses. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% and compared to the prior quarter as strength in auto originations, combined with growth in residential mortgage was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances, primarily from GreenSky balance runoff. Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 6% with C&I loans up 8%. Commercial loan production remained strong and in line with our original expectations. Production was strongest in core middle market, which was well diversified geographically, which increased over 60% year-over-year. Our production and pipelines continued to reflect our strategic investments in talent and our successful geographic expansion as we sustained our record pace in adding new quality relationships during the first quarter.\nWith muted payoffs and higher revolver utilization rates reflecting the capital market slowdown, period-end commercial loans, excluding PPP, increased 5% sequentially, and and 13% compared to the year ago quarter. Over half of the sequential period end growth was due to existing revolvers with a utilization rate increasing 2% to 35.5%.-- Given themarket opportunities in the first quarter, we began deploying excess cash to protect against the rising risk of an economic downturn.\nDuring the first quarter, we grew our securities portfolio of approximately $13 billion. On an average basis, securities increased $5 billion or 13% sequentially. As we have said over the past 2 years, our balance sheet positioning allowed us to remain patient and not grow the portfolio at historically low interest rates caused by the extraordinary Federal Reserve intervention.\nThe past 90 days have absolutely validated our decision to patiently wait and our actions this quarter and beyond will ensure our strong through-the-cycle performance under various rate scenarios over the long term. Our investments continue to focus on adding duration and structure to the portfolio with stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increased from 59% to 64% at quarter end.\nAverage other short-term investments, which includes our interest-bearing cash, decreased $6 billion, reflecting the growth in loans and securities, partially offset by continued core deposit growth. Compared to the year-ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 11%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We once again added households in every market compared to last year, led by our key Southeast markets.\nMoving to credit. As Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with NPAs at 47 basis points and net charge-offs at 12 basis points. We continue to closely monitor areas where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. As Greg also mentioned, we have deliberately reduced our highly monitored leveraged loan portfolio for this very reason, which is now below $3 billion in outstandings, while also significantly improving the quality of the portfolio. Moving to the ACL. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.7%. We maintained our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Our ACL build this quarter reflected strong loan growth and a worsening downside economic scenario partially offset by improvements in the credit risk profile of the loan portfolio, including a reduction in borrowers and prolonged distress. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $1.1 billion higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $236 million lower.\nWhile our base case expectations point to continued economic growth, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, including escalating geopolitical tensions, which could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains, pressures from the Fed's quantitative tightening or additional coded variants, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.3%, above our stated target of 9%. We -- the decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth in light of the robust organic business opportunities and securities purchases, combined with an 8 basis point impact from the CECL capital transition rule.\nWe expect to close the acquisition of Dividend Finance in the second quarter, which will deploy approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 1% during the quarter and 5% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to our current outlook, which includes the financial impacts from dividend finance. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 and including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth of around 10% and reflecting strong pipelines, sales force additions, the dividend and provide acquisitions and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% or 15% to 16%, excluding PPP. We now expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022 and reflecting our first quarter decision to lower auto loan production in order to enhance our returns on capital.\nWe now expect around $8 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year. which will still result in double-digit growth in indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes modest growth in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of dividend finance, partially offset by a 20% decline in GreenSky loans.\nOn a sequential basis, we expect second quarter average total loan growth of 2% to 3%, comprised of 3% to 4% commercial balance growth and stable consumer balances. We expect 5% to 6% average C&I growth in the second quarter. Excluding PPP. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase approximately $10 billion in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made later in the first quarter combined with the assumption that we had $2 billion in balances given the market opportunities we have seen through early April. We also assume $1 billion in additional securities growth in both the third and fourth quarter.\nGiven our outlook -- for earning asset growth, combined with the implied forward curve as of April 1, we now expect full year NII to increase approximately 13% to 14%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the runoff of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which result in a $220 million headwind this year. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would exceed 18%.\nOur current outlook assumes stable to slight growth in deposit balances in 2022 and compared to 2021 with continued strong growth in consumer deposits in the mid-single digits, offset by the expected runoff of nonoperational commercial deposits. We expect deposit betas of around 15% on the first 125 basis points of Fed rate hikes. The 25 basis points we saw in March, combined with another 50 basis points in both May and June.\nWhile we remain confident in the quality of our deposit base, the rapid and aggressive policy responds by the Fed to curb inflation, including the potential for 10 rate hikes from March 2022 to March 2023 and aggressive Fed balance sheet reductions, we expect deposit betas of approximately 25% and over the first 200 basis points this cycle compared to the mid-30s last cycle. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements. Balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions, and realized deposit betas. For the second quarter, we expect NII to be up 11% to 13% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our asset-sensitive balance sheet. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable to down 1% in 2022 and compared to our prior expectations of up 3% to 5%. This change is primarily driven by the change in our rate outlook.\nThe single biggest line contributing to the change is deposit service charges which is reflective of incremental earnings credits in light of the higher interest rate environment. The rate environment has also impacted our outlook for mortgage revenue which we now expect to be down 10% or so in 2022 compared to 2021. We we continue to expect strong but slightly lower than January expectations in commercial banking fees and private equity income in 2022 and provided resolutions of the temporary delays experienced in the first quarter occur. It is worth noting that even with the decline in expected fee income, primarily due to the interest rate environment, -- we expect total revenue to now be approximately $275 million more than our January guidance. We expect second quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter or down around 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be stable on a stand-alone basis or up]1% to 2%, including the impact of dividend finance compared to 2021 and which is an improvement from our previous guidance of up 2% to 3%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we add 25 new branches, primarily in our high-growth Southeast markets. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that Tim mentioned. We expect these investments in our people, platforms and franchise to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given our disposition of LaSalle Business Solutions, which was completed in April and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. We expect total adjusted expenses in the second quarter to be down around 3% to 4% compared to the first quarter, which is up 2% compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of Provide and dividend finance or stable on a stand-alone basis.\nAs a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to significantly exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in nearly 3.5 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects our recent acquisitions, expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP in our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis points range.\nIn summary, we continue to take actions to further strengthen our balance sheet positioning for this environment. We are deploying excess cash prudently into both loans and securities to support continued through-the-cycle outperformance and have a lot of momentum in our businesses to have a very successful 2022. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. Operator, please open the call up for questions. ."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fifth Third Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; President, Tim Spence; CFO, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn over the call now to Greg for his comments.\n\nGregory D. Carmichael\n\nChairman & CEO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported full year net income of $2.8 billion or $3.73 per share. We delivered strong financial results throughout the year, while fully supporting our customers, our communities and our employees.\nWe generated full year adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19%. Additionally, excluding the provision benefit in excess of charge-offs, our ROTCE exceeded 16% and improved more than 130 basis points from last year, driven by record financial results throughout the franchise. We generated record revenue of nearly $8 billion in 2021, which increased 4% compared to 2020, highlighted by strength in commercial, retail and wealth and asset management. Our performance was led by record adjusted fee revenue, which increased 8%. Net interest income was stable compared to last year despite the continued environmental headwinds as we have been disciplined deploying excess cash.\nFull year adjusted expenses increased just 2.5% compared to last year, reflecting disciplined expense management throughout the company. As a result of our strong financial performance, we achieved positive operating leverage, excluding security gains and losses and generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 60%. Credit quality remains strong with historically low full year net charge-offs of just 16 basis points. Additionally, nonperforming loans and criticized assets continue to improve throughout the year, including the fourth quarter.\nOur credit results demonstrate our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued benefits from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $662 million or $0.90 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.03 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.93 per share. Our quarterly financial results reflected strong momentum in most of our businesses. We saw that improved revenues compared to the third quarter. We generated record commercial banking revenue, record treasury management revenue and record wealth and asset management revenue in the quarter. We expect the positive momentum in our business to carry forward into 2022 and beyond.\nIn our commercial business, record loan production of $8.2 billion increased approximately 50% sequentially with record performances in both corporate banking and middle market. Despite the ongoing challenges we are hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, production was broad-based across our regions and verticals.\nFrom a regional middle market perspective, we generated strong production this year in several markets, including Chicago, the Carolinas, Indiana, Georgia and our expansion markets. From an industry vertical perspective, health care, renewables, retail, technology and financial institutions all continued to outperform. As result of our record production and record new quality relationships, we generated C&I loan growth, excluding PPP of 7% on an average basis or 11% on a period-end basis compared to last quarter.\nThe acceleration of commercial loan growth at the end of 2021, our strong pipeline, new commitment growth, production anticipated from Provide and continued investments in capabilities and talent will also support accelerated loan growth in 2022. In our retail business, we once again generated consistent peer-leading consumer household growth in excess of 3% year-over-year, highlighted by our Chicago and Southeast markets. We continue to add households in every region, reflecting the ongoing success of momentum banking as well as our branch expansion and digital initiatives.\nOur success throughout our retail business comes down to 3 factors. First, we are generating [small scale] in our local markets. This quarter, we opened 18 banking centers in our key Southeast MSAs, while consolidating 4 locations throughout our footprint. We have also closed an additional 40 locations in the month of January, primarily in legacy markets. We will continue to leverage our geospatial analytics to optimize our overall branch network while taking into account evolving customer preferences. We continue to target a branch network allocation of approximately 35% in the Southeast by 2025.\nSecond, we offer differentiated products and services like Momentum Banking, which includes features that enable customers to avoid overdraft fees and get access to short-term liquidity when needed. I'd like to point out with respect to unit fees, we have been the lowest among peers with significant consumer banking operations for several quarters. And third, we are delivering an outstanding customer experience as shown by leading third-party surveys. We have improved in the bottom quartile 5 years ago to top quartile today. We are recognized as the #1 bank out of the top 25 banks taking care of our customers during the pandemic.\nOur balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. Last night to support continued acceleration of our growth and profitability, we announced the acquisition of Dividend Finance, a leading fintech point-of-sale, consumer lender, providing solutions for a highly attractive and growing renewable energy industry. They have strong relationships with a robust contract network, offer sales and project management solutions through a state-of-the-art technology platform and have a customer footprint focused on prime and super-prime borrowers.\nThey have a coast-to-coast footprint with targeted growth initiatives in the Southeast. By financing consumer renewable energy solutions, combined with our existing leadership in providing renewable solutions to commercial clients since 2012, we are supporting the country's transition to a more sustainable economy and furthering our ESG leadership position among peers. As the only bank among peers that are earning a leadership score from CDP for 3 consecutive years, we are intensely focused on leading the transition to a sustainable future. Our focus has been recognized by several prominent ESG providers, including MSCI, which recently gave us a 3-notch rating upgrade.\nIn our sustained peer-leading household growth, top quartile key metrics, balance sheet management or strong diversified fee revenues, we have established a track record of doing what we say we're going to do. Our execution ultimately produces superior, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Across all of our businesses, our strategic priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, investing to drive growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining discipline throughout the company.\nBefore turning it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continued rising to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other. This is because of our frontline employees that we were able to keep within 99% of our branches opened since the onset of the pandemic. We gave a special bonus to these employees in the quarter in recognition of their extraordinary and ongoing efforts to provide essential banking services for our customers. This marks the second time during the pandemic that we have recognized the work of our frontline employees through a special bonus.\nIn summary, we believe our strong and highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage again for the full year in 2022 without adjusting for PPP or other known headwinds. We remain focused on growing strong relationships and managing the balance sheet with a through-the-cycle perspective to generate sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders and maintaining our position as a top-performing regional bank.\nWith that, I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook.\n\nJames C. Leonard\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our strong quarterly financial results reflect focused execution throughout the bank. The reported earnings included a negative $0.03 impact from the 2 items noted in the release.\nWe generated solid revenue growth, which resulted in record fee income, combined with another quarter of strong credit quality. As a result, we produced an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of over 18%. Improvements in credit quality resulted in an $85 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 185 basis points compared to 200 basis points last quarter. Combined with another quarter of historically low net charge-offs, we had a $47 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses.\nMoving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 1% sequentially, reflecting C&I loan growth, $10 million in seasonal mutual fund dividends and $18 million in prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio as well as a reduction in long-term debt. These items were partially offset by lower loan yields and a decline in PPP-related income, which was $36 million this quarter compared to $47 million in the prior quarter. Excluding PPP, NII increased $19 million or 2% sequentially. On the funding side, we reduced our total interest-bearing liabilities cost 3 basis points this quarter.\nCompared to the prior quarter, reported net interest margin decreased 4 basis points reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in interest-bearing cash and lower loan yields, partially offset by prepayment penalties and mutual fund dividends from our investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of excess cash, NIM was flat sequentially. Total reported noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter. As we discussed in early December, reported results included negative valuation marks totaling $22 million, attributable to a $5 million negative MSR valuation as well as a $17 million fintech investment unrealized loss recorded in securities losses that occurred since its October IPO.\nSimilar to our previous holdings of public companies, we will exit our position at the appropriate time. Adjusted noninterest income results exclude the impact of security gains and losses, the Visa swap, as well as prior period business disposition gains and losses. Adjusted noninterest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by another quarter of record commercial banking revenue. We generated record M&A advisory fees notably in our health care vertical, reflecting successful outcomes from our Coker and H2C teams, combined with strong business lending and syndication revenue.\nThese items were partially offset by lower corporate bond fees. We also generated solid fee revenue growth in treasury management, card and processing and wealth and asset management, where we generated record net AUM inflows in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We were recently recognized as one of the world's best private banks for the third consecutive year by Global Finance Magazine and our results reflected.\nAdditionally, Mortgage banking revenue decreased $51 million compared to the third quarter, which included a $12 million unfavorable impact from our decision to retain $350 million of retail production during the quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 2% with improvement in every single fee caption reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Noninterest income represented 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower occupancy expense as well as lower processing expense reflecting contract renegotiations.\nAdjusted expenses increased 2%, driven by higher performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results from record AUM inflows and commercial loan production, elevated medical benefits due to pandemic, loan servicing expenses and continued technology investments. Our expenses this quarter included mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation of $10 million compared to less than $1 million last quarter.\nFor the full year, total adjusted fees increased 8% compared to just 2.5% expense growth. Commercial Banking revenue increased 21%. Card and processing revenue increased 14%. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 13% and TM revenue increased 9%, offset by a $28 million reduction from lower TRA income and a 16% decline in mortgage banking. On the expense side, the largest contributor of the growth was elevated performance-based compensation, technology investments and loan servicing expenses. These items were partially offset by the actions we took about a year ago to streamline the organization, including process reengineering, vendor renegotiations, and divestitures of noncore businesses such as property and casualty insurance, HSA deposits and 401(k) recordkeeping.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, including the PPP headwind. Excluding PPP, portfolio loans and leases increased 3% on an average basis and increased 5% on a period-end basis.\nAverage total consumer portfolio loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter as continued strength in auto was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances. Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 4% with C&I loans up 7%.\nAs Greg mentioned, commercial loan production was robust across the board, up nearly 50% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting strong corporate and middle market banking production, which was well diversified geographically.\nAs a result, period-end C&I loans, excluding PPP, increased 11% sequentially. Revolver utilization of 33% increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic.\nAs we have discussed before, we continue to have the lowest CRE concentration as a percentage of total capital compared to peers. Given the rate environment towards the end of the fourth quarter, we began investing a small portion of our excess cash with the average securities portfolio balances increasing 1% sequentially.\nAverage other short-term investments, which includes our interest-bearing cash, remained elevated, reflecting continued growth in core deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and consumer transaction deposits increased 2%.\nMoving to credit. As Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with fourth quarter net charge-offs remaining historically low. Nonperforming assets declined 6% sequentially with the NPA ratio declining 5 basis points.\nCriticized assets declined 13% sequentially, reflecting a significant improvement from COVID high-impact industries. Additionally, criticized assets declined in virtually every region and vertical and also improved in our leveraged loan portfolio.\nFrom a product standpoint, we continue to closely monitor CRE, including office and hospitality exposures given the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Moving to the ACL. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%. We did not change our scenario [weights] of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios given the continued uncertainty during the pandemic.\nOur ACL release this quarter came primarily from commercial, reflecting the improved risk profile of the portfolio. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $960 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $213 million lower. While the economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to continued strength in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our December 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment.\nMoving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong with the CET1 ratio ending the quarter at 9.5%. During the quarter, we completed $316 million in share repurchases as part of our capital plan, which reduced our share count by 7.3 million shares. Now that we have reached our 9.5% CET1 goal, we are returning to our 2019 CET1 target of 9% based on our improved credit risk profile and the economic outlook. It is worth noting that combining regulatory capital, credit reserves and unrealized gains, we have one of the highest overall loss absorbency rates among peers.\nAs Greg mentioned, last night, we announced the strategic acquisition of Dividend Finance. Strategically, Dividend furthers our existing indirect consumer point-of-sale capabilities with a tech-forward platform. Dividend pioneered the financing model, which improves economic outcomes for customers and contractors. This helps accelerate Dividend's growth in the solar industry which is expected to continue growing at a double-digit CAGR over the next several years.\nDividend will improve Fifth Third's loan portfolio granularity, geographic diversification and balance between consumer and commercial loans. Furthermore, while not modeled, we expect to generate synergies over time in our mortgage and home equity business as well as with our existing commercial clients.\nThe transaction is also financially compelling. In 2021, Dividend gained market share and originated over $1 billion in loans, which increased 40% compared to 2019. We expect total origination volume of around $1 billion in 2022 post close. Dividend Finance previously utilized an originate-to-sell model. And as a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a material transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan originations.\nGiven the scalability of the business, we expect a life of loan ROA of 3% plus, ROTCE of 30% plus and an efficiency ratio below 20%. Our modeling conservatively assumes a market share consistent with Dividend Finance's recent history. No extension of the federal solar investment tax credit and annualized net charge-offs around 130 basis points. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter and will utilize approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our long-term capital priorities remain unchanged. First, deploy capital into organic growth initiatives, then evaluate strategic nonbank opportunities, continue paying a strong dividend, and finally, execute share repurchases with excess capital.\nGiven the strong loan growth and the acquisition of Dividend Finance, we currently expect to resume share repurchases sometime in the second half of the year. Moving to our current outlook. Our full year guidance includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021, including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added throughout last year.\nExcluding these items, we expect total average loan growth between 10% and 11%, reflecting robust pipelines, sales force additions, the dividend and provide acquisitions and only a 1% improvement in commercial revolver utilization rates over the course of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 12% to 13%, excluding PPP. Additionally, we expect total average consumer loan growth between 6% and 7%, excluding the Ginnie Mae loans.\nOn a sequential basis, we expect first quarter average total loan growth of 3% to 4%, excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae loans. Including those impacts, we expect average total loans to increase 1% to 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Our outlook reflects continued strength in commercial given our production and pipelines. We expect 6% average C&I growth in the first quarter, excluding PPP.\nWe expect CRE balances to be stable sequentially in the first quarter, and as a result, expect average total commercial loan growth of 4% to 5% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, excluding the Ginnie Mae impacts. We provide our expectations for this portfolio in our presentation appendix.\nGiven our loan outlook, we expect full year NII to increase 4% to 5%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which will result in a $220 million headwind next year or about 4.5 percentage points. Meaning we would have expected close to double-digit growth in NII, if not for those portfolios, which have served their purpose to help bridge us to the more productive rate environment.\nGiven that current rate environment, our forecast assumes growth in our securities portfolio of approximately $1 billion per quarter and includes 3 rate hikes beginning in May. Due to the evolving economic outlook, our forecast and balance sheet management strategies are subject to change. As a reference point, we estimate that a 25 basis point incremental rate hike would increase NII by approximately $30 million to $35 million per quarter or 7 basis points of NIM when fully realized. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing of short-term rate movements balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas.\nOn the topic of deposit betas, our current outlook assumes a deposit beta around 13% over the first 100 basis points of rate hikes, including less than 10% for the first couple of hikes. We have updated our NII sensitivity disclosures in the presentation appendix, which now incorporates a dynamic beta repricing assumption rather than static beta approach previously utilized. The information in the appendix uses modeled approaches to estimate the impacts of various rate scenarios based on decades of historical data.\nThese model betas are 30% for the first 100 basis point scenario and 36% for the plus 200 basis point scenario. For the first quarter, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially, impacted primarily by day count as well as lower prepayment penalty, PPP and Ginnie Mae income, partially offset by strong loan growth. Given the January 3 forward curve did not consider a March rate hike, if the Fed were to move in March with a run-up in benchmark rates, we would expect first quarter NII to be stable sequentially.\nWe expect adjusted noninterest income to increase 3% to 5% in 2022, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger treasury management revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue. Additionally, we expect strong processing revenue, reflecting both the economic environment and continued household growth.\nMortgage revenue should improve modestly in 2022, reflecting elevated servicing revenue from MSR purchases throughout 2021 and moderating asset decay partially offset by a meaningful decrease in production revenue.\nWe expect TRA and private equity income to be stable compared to 2021 levels. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be stable year-over-year or decline around 8% to 9% compared to the fourth quarter. Excluding the impacts of the TRA, we expect fees to be down approximately 3% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors, a decline in private equity income and lower leasing revenue.\nWe expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1%, excluding the impact of dividend finance compared to 2021 or up 2% to 3%, including dividend. We expect compensation expenses to increase around 3% or so, reflecting wage pressures and sales force additions, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation in certain areas such as mortgage given the outlook for lower origination volumes.\nWe also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10%, consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single digits area. Our outlook also assumes we add 20 to 25 new branches in our high-growth markets, which will result in high single-digit growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect these items to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given the revenue outlook and continued overall expense discipline throughout the company.\nWe expect total adjusted expenses in the first quarter of 2022 to be up around 3% to 4% compared to the year ago quarter or up 5% to 6% compared to the prior quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are also impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we expect first quarter expenses to be down approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter.\nAdditionally, our first quarter expense outlook is impacted by a broader and larger special equity grant for eligible employees to reward the record performance in 2021 and to provide a retention incentive over the next several years in this competitive labor market. As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in more than a 1-point improvement in the efficiency ratio.\nOur outlook for positive operating leverage reflects continued success growing our fee-based businesses, recent acquisitions, expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We would have guided to positive operating leverage on a stand-alone basis even without any rate hikes. We expect 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be in the 15 to 20 basis points range.\nIn summary, our fourth quarter and full year results were strong We achieved positive operating leverage in 2021 in a challenging interest rate environment, while maintaining discipline throughout the company. We have a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, which should perform very well in a rising rate environment, we have over $30 billion of excess cash and continue to grow and diversify our fee revenues, all of which support our through-the-cycle outperformance. We are deploying capital in order to maximize long-term profitability and are committed to generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\n\nChristopher Doll\n\nDirector of IR, Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nThanks, Jamie. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please open the call up for questions."

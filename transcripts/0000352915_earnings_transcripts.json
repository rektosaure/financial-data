Welcome to the Third Quarter 2025 Universal Health Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to Darren Lehrich, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDarren Lehrich\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Universal Health Services Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Darren Lehrich, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nWith me this morning are our President and CEO, Marc Miller; and our Chief Financial Officer, Steve Filton. Marc and Steve will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll open to Q&A.\nDuring today's conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, we recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and -- forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.\nIn addition, we may reference during today's call, measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA net of NCI and adjusted net income attributable to UHS which are non-GAAP financial measures information and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income attributable to UHS can be found in today's press release.\nWith that, let me now turn it over to Marc Miller for some introductory remarks.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for your interest in UHS. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome down to the UHS team. We look forward to having him in a dedicated Investor Relations function for our company. .\nTurning to our third quarter 2025 results. We reported adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $5.69 per share representing a 53% increase from the third quarter of 2024. Revenue growth for the third quarter of 2025 was 13.4% year-over-year. Our third quarter performance reflects continued growth in our acute care operating environment, modest volume improvement in our behavioral health segment and solid pricing across both segments. The third quarter included $90 million of net benefit from the recently approved supplemental Medicaid program in addition of Columbia.\nSteve will cover the details of this approval and other supplemental Medicaid program updates. Based on our operational performance year-to-date and the increased supplemental reimbursement in the District of Columbia, offset somewhat by additional professional and general liability reserves, we are increasing the midpoint of our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance by 6% to $21.80 per diluted share from $20.50 per diluted share previously.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced progress in our 2 most recent acute care hospital openings, West Henderson Hospital in Henderson, Nevada and Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Specific to Cedar Hill, we achieved accreditation in early September. As a result, the financial drag from our certification timing delay and start-up issues began to subside during the third quarter, and we expect to exit this year at breakeven or better. putting us in a stronger position at this facility heading into 2026. We believe the long-term outlook for Cedar Hill remains favorable due to demand for services and strong support within the community. as well as our long-standing presence in the district at the George Washington University Hospital.\nOur next de novo acute care hospital opening will be the Alan B. Miller Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens slated for 2026 -- slated for spring of 2026. This project remains on track, and we are encouraged by significant interest in the new medical campus by members of the community and the health care professionals that serve patients within this fast-growing market. We have a long track record of expanding presence in core markets with new state-of-the-art hospitals and are excited to build on our existing presence on the East Coast of Florida.\nSeparate from these new hospital projects, we've also been active on the outpatient side within our acute care segment, where we operate 45 outpatient access points, including freestanding emergency departments, surgery centers and other ambulatory services. On a year-to-date basis, we've opened 4 freestanding EDs, bringing our total to 34 and we believe our [FDD] strategy is highly complementary to our acute care operations by allowing us to capture incremental higher acuity outpatient volume within our markets.\nWithin our behavioral health segment, we've taken a disciplined approach to new bed capacity growth which has allowed us to focus on the highest potential expansion and de novo projects while we increasingly devote resources to accelerate our outpatient behavioral strategy.\nOn the outpatient side of our behavioral segment, we operate approximately 100 access points, including step-down programs closely aligned with inpatient and residential operations as well as step-in programs that allow us to reach patients in convenient community settings. We are on track to open 10 of these step-in programs this year under local brands, as well as our new 1,000 branches wellness brand in a model that supports outpatient services through both virtual and in-person settings.\nOur strategies are designed to accelerate our outpatient growth rate, diversify our payer mix and allow us to be the provider of choice within the behavioral marketplace that continues to have strong demand across the continuum. The behavioral health care we provide serves an important need within the health care system and our society more broadly.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Filton, for a financial review of the third quarter.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. I will highlight a few financial and operational trends before opening the call up to questions. The company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.86 for the third quarter of 2025. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $5.69 for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\nWe recognized approximately $90 million of net benefit during the third quarter of 2025 from the District of Columbia supplemental Medicaid program, which covered the time period from October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025. Approximately $73 million of this benefit was recognized in our acute care results while the remaining benefit was recognized in our behavioral results.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025 on a same facility basis, adjusted admissions in our acute care hospitals increased 2.0% and over the third quarter of the prior year. Acute care volumes were consistent with trends in the first half of 2025 with solid growth in both inpatient medical admissions and outpaced services during the third quarter and surgical volumes that increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Same facility net revenues in our acute hospital segment increased by 12.8% during the third quarter of 2025 on a reported basis as compared to last year's third quarter and increased 9.4% after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary and the prior period net benefit from the District of Columbia supplemental Medicaid program.\nAcute Care same-facility revenue per adjusted admission increased by 9.8% during the third quarter of 2025 on a reported basis and increased 7.3% after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary and a prior period impact of the District of Columbia supplemental Medicaid benefit.\nOperating expenses continued to be well managed across labor, supplies and other expense categories. We have not experienced any noteworthy impact from tariff trade policies. Total operating expenses per adjusted admission increased by 4.0% on a same facility basis over last year's third quarter after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary.\nFor the third quarter of 2025, our solid acute care revenues, combined with effective expense controls, resulted in a 190 basis point increase year-over-year in same-facility EBITDA margin to 15.8% after excluding the prior period impact of the District of Columbia's supplemental benefit.\nTurning to our behavioral health results. During the third quarter of 2025, same facility net revenues increased 9.3% on a reported basis and were up 8.5%, excluding the prior period impact of the District of Columbia supplemental Medicaid program. Same-facility revenue growth was driven by a 7.9% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day as compared to the prior year.\nExcluding the prior period impact of the District of Columbia supplemental, same revenue facility revenue per adjusted patient day increased 7.1% during the third quarter 2025.\nSame facility adjusted patient days increased 1.3% as compared to the prior period's third quarter with volume growth modestly improving as compared to 1.2% in the second quarter and 0.4% during the first half of 2025. We expect further volume improvements during the fourth quarter, although we now believe a reasonable expectation for same facility adjusted patient day growth should be in the 2% to 3% range with our near-term expectations at the lower end of this range.\nExpenses in our behavioral health segment continued to be well managed with relatively stable margins during the third quarter leading to a 7.6% increase in same-facility EBITDA as compared to the third quarter of 2024 after excluding the prior period impact of the District of Columbia supplemental benefit. We continue to experience labor tightness in some markets, although hiring trends have improved steadily throughout the year.\nOur cash generated from operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion during the first 9 months of 2025 as compared to approximately $1.4 billion during the same period in 2024. We expect to collect the $90 million of District of Columbia supplemental payments during the fourth quarter of 2025.\nDuring the first 9 months of 2025, we spent $734 million on capital expenditures, close to 30% of which related to the new hospital in Florida and a replacement facility in California. During the 9 months ended September 30, 2025, we also acquired 3.19 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $566 million including 1.315 million shares purchased during the third quarter of 2025.\nToday, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, bringing our total authorization to $1.759 billion, including amounts remaining under the previous authorization. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 36% of the company's outstanding shares and paid approximately $340 million in dividends to shareholders.\nIn the absence of compelling acquisition opportunities over the near term, we expect to continue to prioritize our excess free cash flow for share buyback and dividends. As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $965 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility.\nTurning to an update on Medicaid supplemental payment programs. Our current projected 2025 full year net benefit from various previously approved programs is $1.3 billion. This figure includes amounts recorded during the third quarter for the previously mentioned district of Columbia program and additional amounts related to this program that are expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025 and but it does not include programs pending CMS approval.\nAs we discussed during our second quarter 2021 earnings call the OB3 legislation includes several significant changes in the Medicaid program, including changes to state directed payment programs and provider taxes. At this time, assuming no changes to our Medicaid revenues or other changes to related state or federal programs, we estimate that commencing with the 2028 fiscal years, our aggregate net benefit will be reduced on an annually increasing and relatively pro rata basis by approximately $420 million to $470 million in 2032.\nThis cumulative impact range has been increased to reflect recent supplemental program approvals. Given various uncertainties, including the evolving state-by-state interpretations and computations related to this legislation, our forecasted estimates are subject to change potentially by material amounts.\nOperator, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're pleased to answer questions at this time."

Welcome to the Q2 2025 Universal Health Services Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please begin.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and -- Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.\nWe'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.43 for the second quarter of 2025. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $5.35 for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, on a same-facility basis, adjusted admissions to our acute care hospitals increased 2.0% over the second quarter of the prior year and surgical volumes were down slightly. Still, same-facility net revenues in our acute care hospital segment increased by 5.7% during the second quarter of 2025 as compared to last year's second quarter after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary. We note that West Henderson Hospital, which opened in late 2024, has had a certain cannibalization impact on the division's same-facility volumes and revenues.\nMeanwhile, operating expenses continue to be well managed. Other operating expenses on the same-facility basis increased 3.1% over last year's second quarter, again, after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary. For the second quarter of 2025, our solid acute care revenues, combined with effective expense controls resulted in a 10% increase in same-facility EBITDA. During the second quarter of 2025, excluding the impact of the Tennessee Medicaid directed payment program, same-facility net revenues of our behavioral health hospitals increased by 5.4%, driven by a 4.2% increase in revenue per adjusted day.\nAdjusted patient days were up 1.2% compared to the prior year's second quarter. Our cash generated from operating activities decreased by $167 million to $909 million during the first 6 months of 2025 as compared to $1.076 billion during the same period in 2024. We expect to collect the $58 million of Tennessee directed payment program receivables in the third quarter. The new hospitals in Las Vegas and the District of Columbia contributed $35 million to the receivable increase. In the first half of 2025, we spent $505 million on capital expenditures, 25% of which related to the 2 new/relacement facilities in California and Florida, both set to open in the spring of 2026. During the first half of 2025, we also acquired 1.9 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $332 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 34% of the company's outstanding shares.\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had approximately $1 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The recently enacted -- on e Beautiful Bill Act includes several significant changes in the Medicaid program, including changes to state-directed payment programs and provider taxes. Beginning with the 2028 state fiscal years and primarily phased in over a 5-year period through 2032, these program changes will limit both the level of payment and the amount of provider tax assessment that states are permitted to utilize to finance the nonfederal share of their respective Medicaid supplemental payments.\nThe legislation provides for different limits depending on whether states have previously expanded their Medicaid eligible population as permitted under the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict, among other things, that this legislation will ultimately be implemented as enacted or if certain states may attempt to implement countermeasures to mitigate its impact. Our current projected 2025 full year net benefit from previously approved state Medicaid supplemental programs is approximately $1.2 billion.\nAt this time, assuming no changes to our Medicaid revenues or other changes to related state or federal programs, we estimate that commencing with the 2028 state fiscal years, our aggregate net benefit will be reduced on an annually increasing and relatively pro rata basis by approximately $360 million to $400 million in 2032. Given the various uncertainties, including the evolving state-by-state interpretations and computations related to the legislation, our forecasted estimates are subject to change potentially by material amounts. Our future operating results potentially starting in 2026 may also be impacted by other factors which are more difficult to predict, such as the impact of Medicaid work requirements, which may decrease Medicaid enrollment and factors that could unfavorably impact insurance exchange enrollment such as the scheduled expiration of insurance exchange subsidies.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mark Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve. So based primarily on the increased DPP reimbursement, we are increasing our midpoint of our 2025 EPS guidance by 7% to $20.50 per diluted share, up from $19.20 per diluted share previously. Medicaid supplemental programs in Washington, D.C. and other potential programs that are not yet fully approved are not included in our revised guidance. We remain pleased with the performance of West Henderson Hospital, which produced a positive EBITDA in the second quarter. At the same time, we acknowledge the significant drag created by the recently opened Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C.\nTiming of hospital certification and other start-up issues proved a bit more challenging than we anticipated, but demand, especially for emergency services, has been very encouraging. Although recovery to expected results will continue into the back half of this year, we remain confident in the positive long-term prospects for the facility that prompted our development partnership with the District of Columbia. De novo growth continues in our behavioral segment. We recently opened a 96-bed Behavioral Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is a joint venture with Trinity Health, Michigan and a 41-bed substance use disorder and dual diagnosis treatment center in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. In addition, we are developing a 144-bed behavioral health hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which is a joint venture with the Lehigh Valley Health Network and is expected to open later this year as well as a 120-bed behavioral health hospital in Independence, Missouri, which is expected to open in late 2026.\nIn addition, we are also continuing to grow our Signet Behavioral Health Network in the U.K., which has added 6 new facilities and 137 beds so far this year. At this time, we're pleased to answer your questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Mark Miller is also joining us this morning. We both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results [indiscernible] March 31, 2025. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements. .\nFor anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.80 for the first quarter of 2025. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $4.84 for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. During the first quarter of 2025, on a same facility basis, adjusted admissions to our acute care hospitals increased 2.4% over the first quarter of the prior year. Same facility net revenues in our acute care hospital segment increased by 5.0% during the first quarter of 2025 as compared to last year's first quarter after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary.\nMeanwhile, operating expenses continued to be well managed. Other operating expenses on a same facility basis increased by 2.6% over last year's first quarter after excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary. For the first quarter of 2025, our solid acute care revenues, combined with effective expense controls, resulted in a 21% increase in EBITDA after excluding the impact of Medicaid supplemental payments. During the first quarter of 2025, same-facility net revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 5.5%, driven by a 5.8% increase in revenue per adjusted day. Adjusted patient days were relatively flat compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe year-over-year patient day growth comparison was negatively impacted by the extra leap day in 2024 and and challenging winter weather conditions experienced this year, early in the first quarter in certain markets. We did experience a reacceleration of patient day growth in March.\nOur cash generated from operating activities decreased from $396 million during the first quarter of 2024 to $360 million this year due in part to delays in receipt of funds in connection with certain Medicaid supplemental payments in various states. We did receive $82 million of payments related to the Nevada supplemental program in April that were related to revenues recorded in the first quarter.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, we spent $239 million on capital expenditures and acquired 1 million of our own shares at a cost of approximately $181 million. Since January 2019, we have repurchased approximately 30.3 million shares, representing 33% of our shares outstanding as of that date. As of March 31, 2025, we had $1.02 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility.\nI will now turn the call over to Mark Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. We are pleased with our first quarter operating results, which on a consolidated basis exceeded our internal expectations. We were particularly encouraged by the control of our operating expenses in both business segments. Our first quarter operating results exclude any supplemental Medicaid revenues in Tennessee and the Dishes of Colombia. .\nPending CMS approval of these new programs. For programs that were originally approved in previous years, we have continued to record those revenues under the assumption that programs will be reapproved. As these programs have been a recent focal point, I believe it is worth reminding people that these are federally authorized and state-approved programs in place for many years. and they are designed to allow providers who have been historically underpaid by Medicaid to provide quality care to over 70 million Medicaid recipients nationally. Even where these programs exist, our net Medicaid reimbursement generally remains below both average commercial and Medicare reimbursement. West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas opened in late 2024 and posted a modestly positive EBITDA in the first quarter.\nCedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C. opened recently and has experienced strong demand for its emergency services from the outset. While we acknowledge a great deal of uncertainty in our external operating environment, we feel confident in our underlying businesses and based on current reimbursement and operating cost levels reiterate our full year earnings guidance.\nWe're pleased to answer questions at this time."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2024 Universal Health Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024.\nDuring the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nWe'd like to highlight certain developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.96 for the fourth quarter of 2024. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule included in the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.92 for the quarter ended December 31, 2024.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, on a same-facility basis, adjusted admissions to our acute care hospitals increased 2.2% over fourth quarter of prior year. Same-facility net revenues in our acute care hospital segment increased by 8.7% during the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven primarily by a 5.3% increase in net revenue per adjusted admission.\nMeanwhile, operating expenses continued to be well managed. The amount of premium paid in the quarter, for example, which declined from a peak of $153 million for the first quarter of 2022 was $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, remaining consistent with the previous 2 quarters. For the full year of 2024, our strong acute care revenues, combined with effective expense controls, resulted in a 13% increase in EBITDA even after excluding the growth in Medicaid supplemental payments.\nDuring the fourth quarter, same-facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 11.1%, driven primarily by an 8.7% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. Excluding the year-over-year growth in Medicaid supplemental payments, the same facility revenue increase was 7.4%.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nIncluded in our operating results during the fourth quarter of 2024, were aggregate net incremental reimbursements of approximately $50 million recorded in connection with various state supplemental Medicaid programs, including $31 million of additional net reimbursements from the Nevada State directed payment program covering the 6-month period of July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. These net reimbursements were more than the supplemental program projections included in our earnings guidance for the full year of 2024 as revised on July 24, 2024.\nAs a result of unfavorable trends experienced during the past several years, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded a $35 million increase to our reserves for self-insured professional and general liability claims. Our operating results for the full year of 2024 included a $79 million increase to our self-insured professional and liability reserves.\nOur cash generated from operating activities was $658 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to $452 million during the same quarter in 2023 and $2.067 billion during the full year of 2024 as compared to $1.268 billion during 2023. We spent $944 million on capital expenditures during 2024, which was consistent with our original forecast for the year.\nIn our acute division, we opened West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas late in 2024 and plan to open Cedar Hill Medical Center in Washington, D.C. in the next two months. We forecast that these facilities will be EBITDA positive in 2025 on a combined basis. In both of our segments, we continue to invest in expansion of our outpatient presence and the broadening of our continuum of care.\nFor the full year of 2024, we acquired $599 million of our own shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. Since January 1, 2019, we have repurchased more than 29.2 million shares representing approximately 32% of our shares outstanding as of that date.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1.17 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThe core operating assumptions underlying our 2025 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, largely reflect the historical trends in their respective businesses with EBITDA growth in the mid-single digits. We expect continued improvement in salary and wages and general cost trends that will remain largely stable in 2025. As noted in our 10-K filed yesterday, our 2025 operating results forecast excludes any supplemental Medicaid revenues in Tennessee and the District of Colombia, pending CMS approval of those programs.\nAs the 10-K schedule reflects, our 2020 forecast -- 2025 forecast assumes total consolidated Medicaid supplemental payments will decrease slightly as compared to 2024. We believe demand for our behavioral services remains solid, and our same facility adjusted patient day growth in 2025 at our facilities located in the U.S. is forecasted to be in the 2.5% to 3% range. We've accelerated technology investments in our behavioral hospitals to improve patient care, including electronic health record implementations and expanded use of patient monitoring automation.\nWe acknowledge that the current political environment has created a level of uncertainty, especially as it relates to ongoing Medicaid reimbursement. Our 2025 forecast is based on current Medicaid reimbursement projections in connection with various programs that could be subject to change. In our acute business segment, we are pleased that 80% of our hospitals currently have an A or B rating well above the national average. And in our behavioral division, we saw meaningfully significant improvement in patient experience scores in 2024.\nWe are focusing on continued improvement of these metrics in 2025. We are now pleased to answer your questions."

Welcome to the Q2 2024 Universal Health Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nDuring the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.\nAs discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.26 for the second quarter of 2024. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $4.31 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nOur acute hospitals experienced a moderation of the demand for their services in the second quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 3.4% year-over-year and surgical growth flattening out. Overall, revenue growth was still a solid 6.6%. Meanwhile, expenses were well controlled. Specifically, the amount of premium pay in the second quarter was $61 million, reflecting a 15% to 20% decline from the prior year quarter.\nOn a same-facility basis, EBITDA at our acute care hospitals increased 37% during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. And the increase was 20% if you exclude the impact of the incremental Medicaid supplemental payments in Nevada.\nDuring the second quarter, same-facility revenues in our behavioral health hospitals increased by 11%, primarily driven by a 9.3% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. Even after adjusting for Medicaid supplemental payments not included in our original 2024 guidance, same facility revenues increased by 7.2% and same facility EBITDA for our behavioral health hospitals increased 13% in the second quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nOur cash generated from operating activities increased by $422 million to $1.1 billion during the first 6 months of 2024 and as compared to $654 million during the same period in 2023. In the first half of 2024, we spent $450 million on capital expenditures and acquired 1.1 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $195 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 30% of the company's outstanding shares.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $1 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.\nIn our acute care segment, we continue to develop additional inpatient and ambulatory care capacity. We currently have 27 operational freestanding emergency departments as well as 12 more, which have been approved and are in various stages of development. Also, construction continues on our de novo acute care hospitals consisting of the 150-bed West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to open late this year. The 136 bed Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C. which is expected to open in the spring of 2025, and the 150-bed [ Allenby ] Miller Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is expected to open in the spring of 2026.\nIn our behavioral health segment, we recently opened the 128-bed River Vista Behavioral Hospital in [ Madera ], California, and we are developing the 96 beds Southbridge behavioral hospital in West Michigan, a joint venture with Trinity Health, Michigan, which is expected to open later this year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve. We're pleased with our second quarter results as both our business segments continued to make operational improvements. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have moderated somewhat and are gradually be going to resemble the patterns we experienced prior to pandemic. The increase in operating income in comparison to last year's second quarter for acute care hospitals is a further step towards a more extended margin recovery, we hope to sustain for the next several periods.\nIn our acute segment, physician expense which is a significant headwind in 2023, has stabilized at approximately 7.5% of revenues.\nBased on the generally favorable operating trends in the first half of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our 2024 EPS guidance by 17% to $15.80 per diluted share from $13.50 per diluted share previously. New supplemental programs being developed in Tennessee and Washington, D.C., which are not yet fully approved are not included in our revised guidance.\nLastly, as announced in yesterday's earnings release, our Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, thereby increasing the current aggregate purchase -- repurchase authorization to $1.228 billion.\nWe're happy to answer questions at this time."

Welcome to the Universal Health Services First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. During this conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.82 for the first quarter of 2024. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.70 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nOur acute hospitals continue to experience strong demand for their services in the first quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 4.5% year-over-year on a same facility basis. When combined with the net revenue per adjusted admission increase of 4.6%, our acute care services net revenues increased by 9.6% during the first quarter of 2024 and as compared to the first quarter of 2023. Despite these increases, we believe that both volumes and acuity in March were adversely impacted by the timing of Easter and spring break which occurred in March of this year compared to April of last year.\nIn connection with the previously disclosed newly implemented Medicaid supplemental reimbursement program in Nevada, our acute care hospitals located in the state recorded approximately $38 million of aggregate incremental income during the first quarter of 2024.\nMeanwhile, premium pay in the quarter was $68 million as compared to $86 million in the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, same-facility net revenues in our behavioral health hospitals increased by 10.4%, driven primarily by an 8.2% increase in revenue per adjusted day. Adjusted patient day growth in the quarter was 2.0% over the prior year quarter. We believe the patient day volume was muted somewhat by the aforementioned calendar timing issues.\nOur cash generated from operating activities increased by $106 million to $396 million during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $291 million during the same quarter in 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we spent $209 million on capital expenditures and acquired 700,000 of our own shares at a cost of approximately $125 million. Since January 1, 2019, we have repurchased almost 27 million shares, representing 30% of our shares outstanding as of that date.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $733 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. I will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve. In our year-end conference call, we said we envisioned 2024 as a year of continued strength in both of our business segments. And during the first quarter of 2024, both segments increased their operating margins when compared to the comparable quarter of 2023. We anticipated that acute care volumes would likely moderate to a degree, but remain robust compared to historical levels. We also believe the acuity trends will continue their recovery trajectory.\nIn our behavioral segment, we anticipated that patient day volumes would gradually improve over the course of the year, returning to a more historically normal level of growth in the 3% range. We noted that both of our business segments have experienced a significant increase in Medicaid supplemental payments which are helping to compensate for several years of inadequate reimbursement levels that have failed to keep up with the costs we had to incur to properly care for our patients. Overall, we're pleased with first quarter results. We are now happy to answer questions at this time."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Universal Health Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.16 for the fourth quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.13 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nOur acute hospitals continue to experience strong demand for their services in the fourth quarter, with adjusted admissions increasing 5.6% year-over-year. Overall surgical volumes were solid as well, increasing 4% year-over-year. Net revenue per adjusted admission, which has lagged for much of the year, increased by 3.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as acuity trends and pressure from payers have started to stabilize. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter of 2022, was $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, similar to what it was in the third quarter.\nFor the full year 2023, our strong acute care revenues were largely offset by elevated expenses, especially physician subsidies which resulted in flattish margins for the full year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, same-facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.2%, driven primarily by a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers, which tended to drive up the revenue per day to relatively robust levels consistent with our year-to-date experience.\nAdditionally, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to see a negative impact of Medicaid redeterminations in certain states on behavioral health volumes, although it appears that impact has also begun to stabilize. With 8% revenue growth, same-facility EBITDA for our behavioral hospitals has increased approximately 9% for the full year of 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nWe also note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded approximately $18 million in connection with the recently approved Mississippi hospital access program covering the 6-month period of July through December of 2023. Our cash generated from operating activities was $452 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $297 million during the same quarter in 2022 and $1.268 billion during the full year of 2023 as compared to $996 million during 2022. We spent $743 million on capital expenditures during 2023 and which was consistent with our original forecast for the year.\nFor the full year of 2023, we acquired $525 million of our own shares pursuant to our repurchase program. Since January 1, 2019, we have repurchased more than 26 million shares, representing almost 30% of our shares outstanding as of that date. As of December 31, 2023, we had $701 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThe core operating assumptions underlying our 2024 operating results forecast which was provided in last night's release, largely reflect the historical pre-coated trends in their respective businesses. We anticipate that volumes in our acute segment will moderate from the elevated 2023 levels, but conversely, acuity and pricing in our acute business will increase, and for the full year, both metrics will resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic, despite the continuing shift of services from inpatient to outpatient settings and pressure from payers to restrain reimbursement increases in a variety of ways. We expect continued improvement in premium pay labor trends and general cost trends that will remain largely stable in 2024. Specifically, physician expenses, which were a major headwind in 2023 are expected to grow by the overall inflation rate in 2024.\nAs noted in our press release, our 2024 operating results includes an additional $149 million of Nevada supplemental revenues, which were approved by CMS in late December and disclosed by us in an 8-K filed in early January. We believe demand for our behavioral services remains robust, and our same-store adjusted patient day growth in 2024 is forecasted to exceed the 2.1% growth we experienced in 2023.\nA significant driver of behavioral volume upside is due to our success in filling vacant positions, but we acknowledge that specialty workforce shortages in certain markets, continue to be an obstacle to even more volume growth. In both our business segments, we were pleased that measures of patient satisfaction and quality of care increased in 2023, and we are focusing on continued improvement of these metrics in 2024.\nWe are pleased to answer questions at this time."

Welcome to the Universal Health Services Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring this conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.\nAs discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.40 for the third quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.55 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the third quarter, same facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.6%, primarily driven by a 6.5% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute care behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers, which tended to drive up the revenue per day beyond the already robust levels we've been posting for several periods.\nAdditionally, as we have anticipated in our original 2023 guidance, we're beginning to see a negative impact of Medicaid redeterminations in certain states on behavioral health volumes. With 8.3% revenue growth, same-facility EBITDA for our behavioral health hospitals has increased approximately 10% during the first 9 months of 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period.\nOur acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services in the third quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 6.8% year-over-year. in part because the volume growth was skewed somewhat to lower acuity procedures, overall revenue growth was 7.5%.\nWhile overall surgical volumes increased about 3% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient. Additionally, we note that managed care behavior has become more aggressive in 2023 as it relates to denials and patient status classification changes. Meanwhile, the amount of premium paid in the third quarter was $69 million, reflecting a 15% decline from the amount in the previous several quarters. The continued robust increase in acute volumes is the major reason the premium pay has not declined further.\nIt's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay was slightly lower than in the third quarter of 2022 -- in 2023 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. Our cash generated from operating activities was $815 million during the first 9 months of 2023 as compared to $699 million during the same period in 2022.\nIn the first 9 months of 2023, we spent $537 million on capital expenditures and acquired $2.7 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $367 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 26% of the company's outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2023, we had $721 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. I will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve. Despite what remains a difficult operating environment, our consolidated results continue to track our revised earnings guidance. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have continued their recovery trajectory and have gradually begun to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic.\nAs Steve has previously commented, we recognize the need to counter the increasingly aggressive behavior on the part of our payers and seek appropriate price increases to offset the impact of inflation on our cost structure and to seek further contractual protection to ensure we are properly reimbursed for the level of care provided to our patients.\nWe previously highlighted the upward pressure on physician expense, which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues, pre-pandemic but is running closer to 7.6% in 2023.\nIn our behavioral segment, we have been pleased with our strong pricing and related earnings growth to date but acknowledge significant upside opportunity in our existing occupancy rates, particularly as we continue to improve our recruitment and retention metrics.\nAs previously disclosed, we expect our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2023 to include revenues earned by our hospitals in connection with the Florida Medicaid managed care directed payment program. In addition, it is worth noting that we continue to believe a new Nevada state directed program, which we have previously disclosed appears to still be on track for 2024 implementation with a potentially materially favorable impact on our Nevada hospitals. We are pleased to answer questions at this time."

I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K year ended December 31, 2022, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nWe'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.42 for the second quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.53 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nOur acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services in the second quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 7.7% over the prior year. Even though the volume growth was skewed somewhat to lower acuity procedures, overall revenue growth was still a very robust 9.7%. While overall surgical volumes were solid, increasing about 5% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the second quarter was $75 million reflecting approximately 10% to 12% decline from the amount in the previous several quarters. The continued robust increase in acute volumes is the major reason that premium pay has not declined further. It's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay, was 4% lower than the second quarter of 2022.\nOn a same-facility basis, EBITDA at our acute care hospitals increased 16% during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. During the second quarter, same-facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.8%, primarily driven by a 6.2% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute care -- our acute behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers which tended to drive up the revenue per day beyond the already relatively robust levels we've been posting for several periods. With a similar level of revenue growth in the first quarter, same facility EBITDA for our behavioral hospitals has increased 12% in the first half of the year compared to the comparable prior year period.\nOur cash generated from operating activities was $654 million during the first 6 months of 2023 as compared to $478 million during the same period in 2022. In the first half of 2023, we spent $337 million on capital expenditures and acquired $1.4 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $192 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of June 30, 2023, we had $946 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.\nIn our acute care segment, we continue to develop additional inpatient and ambulatory care capacity. We currently have 24 operational freestanding emergency departments as well as 3 additional which are expected to be completed and opened over the next 6 months and 9 more which have been approved and are in various stages of development. Also, construction continues on our de novo acute care hospitals consisting of the 150-bed West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to open next fall; the 150-bed Allen B Miller Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; and the 136 beds Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C., both of which are expected to open in 2025.\nIn our behavioral health segment, we recently completed and opened the 120-bed River Vista Behavioral Health Hospital in Madera, California, and we broke ground on the 96-bed Southridge behavioral hospital in West Michigan, a joint venture with Trinity Health, Michigan, which is expected to open later next year.\nI will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for some closing comments.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve. We were generally pleased with our second quarter results as both of our business segments continued their transition into a post-pandemic world. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have continued their recovery trajectory, and have gradually begun to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. The comparison to last year's second quarter for our acute hospitals is the first apples-to-apples comparison of 2 low COVID volume quarters we have had since the pandemic began and the 60-basis-point year-over-year margin improvement in Q2 is a step towards a more extended margin recovery, we hope to sustain for the next several periods.\nIn our acute segment, we highlighted the upward pressure on physician expense which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues pre-pandemic, but is running closer to 7.6% in 2023. Based on the generally favorable operating trends in the first half of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 EPS guidance from $9.50 a share to $9.85 a share. As we have previously disclosed, our 2023 guidance had originally assumed recognition in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $25 million of supplemental revenues from a Nevada Medicaid program. The state has dramatically reduced the funding for this program, and we now believe our fourth quarter revenue recognition will be only approximately $3 million. This reduction has informed our decision not to change the upper end of our guidance range at this time. It is worth noting that we believe a new Nevada state-directed program which we also have previously disclosed appears to still be on track for a 2024 implementation with a potentially materially favorable impact on our Nevada hospitals.\nWe are pleased to answer questions at this time."

After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.34 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nDuring the first quarter, our behavioral health hospitals produced strong results. The decline in COVID activity allowed our behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies resulting in a reduction of the bed capacity and a 4.7% year-over-year increase in adjusted patient days. Combined with a healthy 5% increase in net revenue per adjusted patient day, overall revenues grew by almost 10% over the prior year quarter. And with that level of revenue growth, same-store behavioral EBITDA margins increased from 20% to almost 23%.\nOur acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services with adjusted admissions increasing 10.5% year-over-year. For a variety of reasons, revenue growth was more muted at 3.5%. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 14% of our admissions in the first quarter of 2022, but only 4% of admissions in the first quarter of 2023. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients.\nThe impact of the COVID support payments including HRSA, Medicare sequestration and the 20% Medicare add-on was a $42 million headwind in the first quarter compared to the same prior year period. There was also $15 million of out-of-period [ Texas TERP ] reimbursement recorded in Q1 of 2022 that did not recur in this year's quarter. While overall surgical volumes were robust, increasing a little over 10% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient, resulting in further overall revenue pressures.\nMeanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter of 2022, was $85 million in the first quarter, similar to what it was in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The dramatic increase in volumes is the major reason that premium pay has not declined further. It's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay, was 7% lower than it was in the first quarter of 2022. In total, the robust volume growth offset by lower revenue per adjusted admission resulted in flat same-store acute care EBITDA compared to last year's quarter.\nWe also note that the first quarter acute non-same-store results included approximately $10 million of a headwind for the impact of the Desert Springs Hospital closure and approximately $5 million of losses related to startup facilities.\nOur cash generated from operating activities was $291 million during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $445 million during the same quarter in 2022. The decline was largely due to an unfavorable change of $183 million in other working capital accounts, primarily due to the timing of disbursements for accrued compensation and accounts payable.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we spent $169 million on capital expenditures and acquired 650,000 of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $79 million. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of March 31, 2023, we had $875 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.\nI'll now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments.\n\nMarc Miller\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning. In our year-end conference call, we said we envisioned 2023 as a year of continued transition into a post-pandemic world. We anticipated that volumes in both segments and acuity in our acute business will continue the recovery trajectory and gradually begin to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic.\nThe comparison to last year's first quarter for our acute hospitals, which were experiencing the significant surge in COVID patients with the Omicron variant is particularly challenging. But many of those COVID-related headwinds will become much less of a factor as the year progresses. We expected to be able to reduce premium pay by about 1/3 in 2023 from 2022 levels as we continue to increase hiring rates and reduce turnover. And while the decline in premium pay has leveled off for the time being, we continue to make progress on overall wage pressures.\nIn our acute segment, we highlighted the upward pressure on physician expense, which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues pre-pandemic but is budgeted to run and actually is closer to 7.5% in 2023. Overall, we were pleased with our first quarter results, which were largely in line with our internal expectations with our behavioral results somewhat ahead and our acute results slightly behind. We are pleased to answer questions at this time."

Filton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Secretary, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nI'm Steve Filton. Marc Miller is joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the fourth quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, primarily an asset impairment charge associated with an acute care hospital in Las Vegas, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.02 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, our acute care hospitals experienced a decrease in the number of patients with a coded diagnosis treated in our hospitals as compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 7% of our admissions in the fourth quarter of 2021 but only about half of that percentage of admissions in the fourth quarter of 2022. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients.\nWhile overall surgical volumes tended to recover to pre-pandemic levels, there was a measurable shift from inpatient to outpatient, resulting in further overall revenue softness. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter was $85 million in the fourth quarter, similar to what it was in the third quarter. In total, there was insufficient revenue growth to offset the accelerated rate of wage increases and other inflationary pressures, leading to an acute EBITDA result in the quarter below our internal forecasts. At the same time, this decline in COVID activity allowed our behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies, resulting in a reduction of the capping of bed capacity. The effect of the increased revenue largely offset higher labor costs, leading to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter more in line with our internal forecasts.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Secretary, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nDo also note that the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of losses related to start-up facilities. Our cash generated from operating activities was $297 million during the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $322 million during the same quarter in 2021. The decline was largely due to the opening of new facilities and the timing of receipt of certain supplemental reimbursements. We spent $734 million on capital expenditures during 2022. In reaction to the earnings softness experienced during the year, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditure spend by about [1 quarter] from our original plans for the year. Similarly, we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases. For the full year of 2022, we acquired $811 million of our own shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had $886 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nOur 2023 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, envisions 2023 as a year of continued transition into a post-pandemic world. We anticipate that volumes in both segments and acuity in our acute business will continue their recovery trajectory and gradually begin to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. Similarly, we expect to be able to reduce premium pay by about 1/3 in 2023 from 2022 levels as we continue to increase hiring rates and reduce turnover as a result of multiple recruitment and retention programs that have been implemented over the last few years. Again, we've assumed these improvements will occur incrementally during the year but will be partially offset by wage pressures created by a continued shortage of nurses and other clinical personnel and by broader inflationary pressures affecting our other expenses.\nWe note that in our acute segment, physician subsidy expense is specifically anticipated to increase by a substantial amount. Other headwinds that are reflected in our 2023 forecast are approximately $100 million in COVID-related reimbursement received in 2022 but phased out in 2023 as well as a reduction of about $30 million in supplemental reimbursement payments as disclosed in our 10-K.\nFinally, we will incur a significant increase in interest expense in 2023, about 3/4 of which was due to rising interest rates and the remainder to increased borrowings. Despite these challenges, we note that some of the operating indicators in early 2023 have been encouraging, especially in our behavioral health business.\nDuring the pandemic, we have found the pace of recovery from several of the aforementioned challenges has often been slower than we originally anticipated and have reflected that gradual cadence of recovery in our forecast. However, we remain confident in the fundamental strength of both our business segments, given our well-positioned hospital franchises around the country. We are pleased to answer questions at this time."

Welcome to the Universal Health Services, Inc. Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Steve Filton, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, Mr. Filton.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Secretary, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.\nFor anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.\nWe'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported an adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.20 for the second quarter of 2022. As previously disclosed in our preannouncement on June 30, 2022, our acute hospitals experienced a significant decline in COVID-related patients during the second quarter of 2022.\nAs a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 13% of total admissions in the first quarter of 2022, but only 3% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in COVID-related patient volumes during the second quarter was not offset by an equivalent increase in non-COVID-related patients resulting in significant shortfalls in revenues and earnings compared to our original forecast for the quarter.\nAnd even though we did make progress in reducing premium pay in the acute segment, which went from $153 million in the first quarter to $117 million in the second quarter, overall costs did not decline sufficiently to offset the weaker revenues. Specifically, a surge in patients with the Omicron variant of the virus, which began in December of '21, tended to peak in most of our geographies in January of '22. In our acute segment, we would note that in general, the Omicron patients were less acutely ill than the COVID-related patients treated in previous surges and thus displayed somewhat lower acuity. Meanwhile, the amount of contract nursing hours used and even more importantly, the rate we had to pay for those hours increased significantly in the first quarter, both on a sequential basis as well as on a year-over-year comparison.\nIn our behavioral segment, we also made progress in filling our vacant positions, but patient day volumes still does not recover as quickly as we originally expected. We do note that our reported second quarter results were benefited from approximately $10 million of revenues from supplemental Texas Medicaid reimbursements, which were not reflected in our estimates for the quarter in the pre-announcement. These revenues were originally contemplated to be recorded in the second half of the year.\nSo the $10 million represents a shift in timing only. The second quarter also included approximately $20 million of startup losses incurred by recently opened de novo acute and behavioral health facilities as well as a $16 million pretax charge incurred to increase our reserves for self-insured professional and general liability claims.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nOur second quarter 2022 operating results were significantly behind our original forecasts. The primary driver of the shortfall was that non-COVID volume did not recover as quickly as we had anticipated. Based on our previous experience during the pandemic when COVID volumes declined rapidly. We believe there are multiple contributing factors to the slower demand rebound, most notably labor scarcity issues which continue to constrain our ability to meet demand in certain circumstances.\nIn the end, however, we believe that the majority of the demand shortfall has been simply delayed or postponed and that ultimately, it will be realized. We are encouraged by the progress made in reducing premium pay and filling vacancies, and we continue to invest heavily in recruitment and retention initiatives. Where appropriate, we are also developing alternative patient care models that allow us to use a wider variety of available caregivers to render the most efficient and high quality of care where we can.\nIn reaction to the earnings softness and the fact that we are completing a refinancing during the quarter, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditure spend by about 20% or $100 million for the first 6 months of the year. Similarly, we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases although we still expect to acquire approximately the same number of shares as in our original guidance. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Welcome to the Universal Health Services, Inc. First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Secretary, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary. Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.\nDuring the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.02 for the first quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the Supplemental Schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.15 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, our operations continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as pressures on staffing and wage rates. Specifically a surge in patients with the Omicron variant of the virus, which began in December of 2021, tended to peak in most of our geographies in January of 2022. In our acute segment, we would note, in general, the Omicron patients were less acutely ill than the COVID patients treated in previous surges and thus display lower acuity.\nMeanwhile, the amount of contract nursing hours used, and even more importantly, the rate we had to pay for those hours, increased significantly in the first quarter, both on a sequential basis as well as a year-to-year -- in a year-to-year comparison. Although in our behavioral segment contract nursing cost did not increase quite as dramatically, our inability to fit all of our labor -- to fill all of our labor vacancies had a notable limiting impact on our patient volumes and related revenues.\nWe do note that our results were benefited in the first quarter from approximately $12 million of revenues net of related provider taxes from special Texas Medicaid reimbursements, which related to the last 4 months of 2021. Recognition of those revenues were deferred until formal government approval was obtained.\nOur first quarter also included approximately $15 million of startup losses incurred by recently opened de novo acute and behavioral health facilities and $6 million of losses related to temporarily closed beds at 2 behavioral health facilities, which were impacted by natural disasters. Those beds have since been reopened.\nAs disclosed in our last night's press release, our operating results for the first quarter of 2022 were unfavorably impacted by labor costs that were higher than anticipated and patient volumes at our behavioral health facilities that were lower than anticipated due to the continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as cost escalations related to the nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff. Although we're not changing our previously released 2022 operating results forecast at this time, we may make reductions to our forecast at a future date if the unfavorable operating trends experienced during the first quarter of 2022 do not improve.\nOur cash generated from operating activities was $445 million during the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $72 million during the same period in 2021. We note that first quarter 2021 cash generation reflected the repayment of the Medicare accelerated payments. We spent $200 million of capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2022, our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 48 days during the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 50 days in the first quarter of 2021.\nDue in large part to the continued repurchasing of our shares at March 31, 2022, our ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to 42.3% as compared to 35.7% at March 31, 2021.\n\nMarc D. Miller\n\nCEO, President & Director, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nOur first quarter 2022 operating results were behind our internal forecasts, and our internal forecasts were below the consensus estimates. The primary driver of the shortfall was the fact that the labor scarcity has not moderated as quickly as we were expecting. We believe, in part, this is because at the height of the Omicron surge, providers were entering into longer-term commitments for temporary or traveling nurses, not necessarily predicting that COVID volumes would decline as rapidly as they ultimately did.\nWe do believe that the demand for this premium-priced labor will continue to gradually decline. In the meantime, we continue to invest heavily in recruitment and retention initiatives and have substantially increased the pace of our hiring. Where appropriate, we are also developing alternative patient care models that allow us to use a wider variety of available caregivers to render the most efficient and highest quality of care that we can.\nWhile the pace of the recovery from the current labor scarcity is still uncertain, we're comfortable that it will occur over time and combined with our confidence in the long-term baseline demand in both of our business segments, our bullish view of the underlying strength of our core businesses remains intact. Reflective of that sentiment, we remained an active acquirer of our own shares in the first quarter, repurchasing $350 million of those shares.\nAt the same time, we continue to reinvest organically opening the new acute care hospital in the Reno market and behavioral de novo and/or joint venture hospitals in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. At this time, we're pleased to answer your questions."

Welcome to the Universal Health Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Steve Filton. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve G. Filton\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Secretary, Universal Health Services, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.\nAs discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3 for the fourth quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.95 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, our operations continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2021, which peaked in January of 2022. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of increased labor scarcity issues exacerbated by the large number of employees sidelined by the virus itself or quarantined due to exposure to the virus.\nIn what was already a very tight labor market, these incremental labor challenges in addition to pressuring our salaries and wages expenses also suppressed patient volumes at our acute care and behavioral health facilities while causing postponement of certain elective scheduled procedures at our acute care hospitals.\nOur net cash generated from operating activities was $884 million during the full year of 2021, which includes the unfavorable impact of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments that were received during 2020 and repaid to the government during 2021. We spent $856 million on capital expenditures during the full year of 2021, which includes the construction costs related to a new 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, that is scheduled to be completed and open next month.\nOur accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the year ended December 30, 2021, as compared to 55 days during 2020. At December 31, 2021, our net -- our ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to 40.8% as compared to 37.9% at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had $854 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.\nIn our acute care segment, our ambulatory care development continued in 2021. We currently have 18 operational freestanding emergency departments and partnerships with national third-party entities for further development of ambulatory surgery centers and home health operations in our existing markets. In conjunction with our ongoing development of primary care physician networks, these initiatives are meant to create a more fulsome care delivery system in each of our markets.\nOur new hospital in Reno scheduled to open soon will enhance our statewide presence in Nevada. Bed tower projects adding new capacities to hospitals in important markets are underway at Edinburgh Regional Medical Center in South Texas, Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas and Inland Valley Medical Center in California.\nPlanning is also underway on new acute care hospitals in West Henderson, Nevada and Palm Beach Gardens in Florida.\nIn our behavioral segment, 2 new de novo joint venture hospitals opened in 2021 in Clive, Iowa and Cape Gerard, Missouri. Two more new hospitals have opened already in 2022 in Michigan, which is a partnership with Beaumont Health and Wisconsin and another is scheduled to open later in the year in Arizona in partnership with HonorHealth. These de novo developments, along with an increased focus on outpatient development and telemedicine in our existing markets is meant to also build out a more fulsome continuum of care in the behavioral segment as well.\nIn anticipation of a continued downward trajectory of COVID volumes from those experienced during recent surges and relief from the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.4 billion increase to our stock repurchase program. After the resumption of our share repurchase activity in the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of our shares during 2021 and close to $300 million more thus far in 2022. We currently have approximately $1.46 billion authorized for stock repurchases after giving effect to the recent increase approved by our Board of Directors.\nOur 2022 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, assumes that the negative impact of the COVID virus will diminish in 2022. While the decline in actual COVID cases appears to be occurring rapidly, we believe the process of backfilling non-COVID cases and, most importantly, the easing of workforce shortages which dominated the health care landscape in 2021 will take place more gradually over the course of 2022.\nWe have a host of active initiatives in place to increase the efficiency of recruitment and retention of our clinical staff and also implementing innovative care models in recognition that certain changes to the health care staffing dynamic may last well beyond the decline in COVID cases.\nWhile the pace of recovery is difficult to predict, we remain confident in the fundamental underlying demand in both of our business segments, the early signs of which have already been emerging in the last few weeks.\nMarc and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

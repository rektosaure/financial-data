As a reminder, this call will be recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI would like now to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nLet me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.\nAdditional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the second quarter earnings release and Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, John Griffith.\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the second quarter and first half of the year.\nAs we announced yesterday, we delivered solid financial results through the first half of 2025. Earnings were $1.48 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.42 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2025, earnings were $2.53 per share compared to $2.37 per share in the same period of 2024. With this strength across the business, combined with our expectations for the rest of the year, we now expect to achieve the top half of our initial EPS guidance range for 2025, which we've narrowed to $5.70 to $5.75 per share. David will share more about our results and guidance a bit later.\nMoving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2025. We invested $1.3 billion in capital projects year-to-date, again reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. We were also very pleased to announce several new acquisition agreements in the first half of the year, including the Nexus Water Group systems that will add nearly 47,000 customer connections, which we expect to close by August 2026. As Cheryl will discuss, we are continuing to build momentum with our business development platform, with 87,000 customer connections under agreement totaling over $500 million across our platform. And we continued our track record of regulatory execution in the first half of 2025, with new rates effective in several states and new cases filed to reflect investments in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers.\nWhich leads us to Slide 6, which describes the drivers of American Water's very competitive and sustainable shareholder return profile. We have a clear top tier capital growth plan underpinned by decades of fundamental water and wastewater infrastructure renewal and water quality investment. This, combined with our strong regulatory and operational execution, results in a value proposition that we believe is unique in the utility sector.\nWe are again affirming our long-term targets for both earnings and dividend growth at 7% to 9%, driven by 8% to 9% rate base growth. We expect to consistently grow earnings and dividends at an industry-leading pace over the next 5 years and beyond.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to David to cover our financial results, rate case updates and our 2025 outlook in further detail. David?\n\nDavid M. Bowler\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. I'll provide further insights on second quarter results.\nConsolidated earnings were $1.48 per share, up $0.06 per share versus the same period in 2024. Revenues were higher by $0.50 per share, driven by authorized rate increases to recover investment across our states. Revenues were also higher from recently completed water and wastewater acquisitions and organic customer growth.\nWeather on the other hand, was unfavorable by an estimated $0.06 per share year-over-year. This was due to wet weather in 2025 across many states, resulting in an unfavorable $0.03 impact combined with the $0.03 unfavorable weather variance from the warm and dry conditions experienced in the second quarter of 2024.\nAnd looking at operating costs, O&M was higher by $0.17 per share, driven primarily by employee-related expense, increased maintenance and technology costs as well as costs related to acquisitions completed in 2024, which we expected. Depreciation increased $0.10 per share and financing costs increased $0.08 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth.\nTurning to Slide 9. Year-to-date consolidated earnings were $2.53 per share, up $0.16 per share versus the same period in 2024. On a weather-normalized basis, EPS was up 9.4% year-to-date compared to the prior year. Many of the same drivers I described for the quarter applied to this period as well, including the unfavorable impact to weather.\nRevenues were higher by $0.94 per share and O&M was higher by $0.32 per share. Depreciation increased $0.21 per share and financing costs increased $0.18 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. First, on completed cases. We received a final order from the Missouri Commission in May, approving our settlement agreement which we discussed last quarter.\nIn Iowa, we received a final order from the commission, approving an annualized revenue increase of $13 million based on an ROE of 9.6% and an equity layer of 52.57%, in line with the Iowa approved capital structure in its previous rate case. As a reminder, interim rates were effective on May 11, 2024, in the amount of $5.1 million, and final rates will go into effect tomorrow on August 1.\nIn Hawaii, we received the final order last week from the commission approving an annualized revenue increase of $1.5 million based on an ROE of 9.75% and an equity layer just north of 52%. We expect new rates to go into effect in early August.\nTurning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases and progress in 3 jurisdictions. On May 5, we filed a general rate case in West Virginia, reflecting $300 million in system investments covering the period March 2024 through February 2027. We are seeking $48 million of additional annual revenue which would be reflected in 2 steps, in March 2026 and March 2027, and we expect this case to be completed by the end of February 2026. Intervenor testimony is set for October and rebuttal testimony in November.\nOn May 16, we filed a general rate case in Kentucky reflecting $212 million insisted -- investments covering February 2025 through December 2026. We we're seeking $27 million of additional annual revenue, and we expect proposed rates to go into effect on an interim basis in December 2025. Intervenor testimony is set for August and rebuttal testimony in September.\nAnd finally, on July 1, we filed a general rate case in California, reflecting system investments through 2028. We we're seeking $63 million of additional annual revenue in 2027 compared to authorized 2025 revenue and a total increase in revenue over the 2027 to 2029 period of $111 million. If approved by the commission, the new rates would take effect on January 1, 2027, with subsequent increases expected in January 2028 and 2029. As a reminder, our request for a 1-year extension of our cost of capital filing on May 1, 2026, was approved earlier this year, which maintains our current authorized cost of capital through 2026, absent significant movements in interest rates.\nAnother piece of our filing is decoupling. We currently have partial decoupling in California, but again, are requesting full decoupling to promote affordable rates and concentration.\nOn a similar front, on the legislative side, a decoupling bill related to water utilities has passed out of the California Senate and is currently awaiting action in the California Assembly Appropriations Committee.\nOn Slide 11, as John mentioned, yesterday, we announced that we are narrowing our 2025 EPS guidance to the top half of the range we first disclosed last October. The 2025 EPS guidance range is now $5.70 to $5.75 from $5.65 to $5.75 previously on a weather-normalized basis. We are seeing strength in the business across several regulated states so far in 2025, including solid customer usage.\nCoupled with the fact that we will continue to have revenue increases year-over-year in several states through Q3, we expect the second half of 2025 to deliver financial results to achieve this narrow guidance range. This puts us on track to deliver 8.6% EPS growth in 2025 at the midpoint of the narrow guidance range. I'm confident in our team's ability to execute on our financial and operating plans, including delivering cost-effective financing while maintaining our balance sheet strength and credit profile.\nOur total debt-to-capital ratio as of the end of the quarter, net of $94 million of cash on hand, was 58%, which was within our target of less than 60%. As a reminder, our 2025 financing plan still includes another long-term debt issuance of roughly $1 billion to be completed in the second half of 2025.\nAnd finally, on Slide 12, I want to reemphasize that we continue to expect to achieve consistent EPS growth within the 7% to 9% range through 2029 and beyond. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth, coupled with our affordability position and sustainability leadership, will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and our position as the largest and most geographically diverse water and wastewater utility in the country distinguishes us from all other utilities.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital program, our recent acquisition activity.\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 14, our capital program delivered $1.3 billion of investments in the first half of the year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.3 billion of capital investment in 2025. Our low-risk annual capital plan is made up of hundreds of individual projects, which our teams do a really great job of executing. As a reminder, the nature of the program also gives us the ability to flex up or flex down our organic CapEx spending annually in order to achieve our overall planned capital spend, including acquisitions. We continue to expect these capital investments and infrastructure and in acquisitions will grow regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%.\nTurning to Slide 15. We continue to be well positioned for growth through acquisitions across many states with about 87,000 customer connections under agreement from deals totaling $535 million. In May, we were pleased to announce an agreement with the Nexus Water Group subsidiary to purchase multiple water and wastewater systems located in 8 states for $315 million. This acquisition will add nearly 47,000 customer connections and approximately $200 million to rate base.\nThrough this transaction, we will grow in 8 of our existing regulated states, supporting our long-term growth target of 2% for customer additions. As with other acquisitions, we'll be able to leverage our scale and size to deliver safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to these new customers. We also believe this expansion will help lead to more growth since it will expand some of our in-state geographies. We expect closing will take place by or before August 2026.\nIn addition to the Nexus systems, we currently have 20 acquisitions in 7 states under agreement for $220 million that would add about 40,000 customer connections. This represents significant progress on the business development front, including in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Importantly, we've seen renewed activity in Pennsylvania, including 4 systems closed so far this year and an additional 8 systems under agreement.\nThe most recent acquisitions announced were the [ Piston ] Wastewater System and the Indian Creek Valley Water Authority, where we plan to utilize fair market value under the new guidelines set by the commission. We have negotiated purchase prices that we believe will result in approval by our regulators of transactions at full cost recovery.\nWe remain confident in our acquisition pipeline, and we are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities across our footprint. In all of our states, the acquisition opportunities are driven by the need for system consolidation, infrastructure upgrades, regulatory compliance and operational enhancements.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI would now like to introduce you your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Danielle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.\nAdditional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the first quarter earnings release and Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nAnd finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share.\nJohn Griffith, our President, will share year-to-date highlights, our affirmation of 2025 EPS guidance and long-term targets and our dividend increase. David Bowler, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our first quarter financial results, provide rate case and legislative updates and we'll review our affirmation of growth drivers and financing plans. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO will then discuss our capital investment program, our acquisition outlook and will conclude with comments on the state of infrastructure in the U.S. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. our CEO, Susan Hardwick, is also with us and will be available for Q&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President, John Griffith.\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we started 2025 with solid financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $1.05 per share for the quarter, a nearly 11% increase compared to $0.95 last year. The increased results are on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we are pleased to affirm representing our expectation of 8% EPS growth in 2025 compared to our weather-normalized 2024 EPS. First quarter 2025 results included $0.03 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of Homeowner Services. Here, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2025 and David and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks.\nWe continued our track record of regulatory and capital plan execution in the first quarter with new rates effective in [indiscernible] states and investments in infrastructure progressing well. I'm proud of our team's efforts supporting two key priorities in Missouri this year. We achieved a constructive settlement in the general rate case in Missouri and are awaiting a final order. And through a collaborative effort with many stakeholders, future test year legislation was signed into law in the state. Both outcomes are supportive of important utility infrastructure investments and aligned with our focus on providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable service to our customers. In addition, we were pleased to see S&P and Moody's, again recognize our strong balance sheet and cash flows and our low-risk profile as they both affirmed our strong investment-grade credit ratings and stable outlook.\nTurning to Slide 6. This quarter, we are again affirming our long-term targets for both earnings and dividend growth at 7% to 9%, driven by 8% to 9% rate base growth. This affirmation is based on our clear top tier capital growth plan and our strong regulatory and operational execution that I believe is a positive differentiator from our peers. We expect to consistently grow earnings and dividends at an industry-leading pace over the next 5 years and beyond, leading to a very competitive value proposition for our shareholders.\nMoving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from [ $0.765 ] per share to [ $0.8225 ] per share, an 8.2% increase. We have grown our dividend consistently over the last decade, significantly outpacing virtually all of our utility peers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to our investors.\nFinally, I'd like to note that today is our last earnings call with Susan at the helm. As you recall, we announced in February with the Q4 release that Susan will be retiring upon our Annual Shareholders' Meeting on the 14th of this month. Susan, we will miss your presence, your leadership and your wisdom and are grateful for everything that you have done for American Water. You've had a long and very distinguished career in the utility sector, and we wish you much happiness and a lot of relaxation in your retirement.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to David to cover our financial results and rate case and legislative updates in further detail. David?\n\nDavid M. Bowler\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Consolidated reported earnings were $1.05 per share, up $0.10 per share versus the same period in 2024. Revenues were higher by $0.44 per share, primarily due to authorized rate increases to recover investment across our states. Revenues were also higher from closed water and moist water acquisitions and organic customer growth. And looking at operating costs, O&M was higher by $0.15 per share, driven primarily by employee-related costs and other increases that support growth in the business and cost related to acquisitions completed in 2024, as we expected. Depreciation increased $0.11 per share and financing costs increased $0.10 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth. And finally, we have $0.01 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 note amendment related to the sale of HOS, which is included in the other net column.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. The two key developments this quarter were rate cases in Missouri and Virginia. In Missouri, we entered into a settlement agreement with several parties, including commission staff and the Office of Public Counsel. We agreed to an annualized revenue increase of $63 million as compared to our most recent revised request of $107 million. New rates are expected to go into effect on May 31, 2025 and once the final order is received from the commission, we will give our view on ROE and capital structure. In Virginia, the commission issued an order approving our settlement of the general rate case. The order approved a $15 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues compared to the original filing that had requested a $20 million increase. The order also approved a return on equity of 9.7% and a higher equity component of the capital structure than in our previous case at nearly 46%. Since interim rates were implemented in May of 2024, results in 2025 won't be meaningfully impacted by this case.\nTurning to active cases. The proceeding in Iowa is progressing as expected, and we expect to receive a final order this month. In Hawaii, we filed a partial settlement agreement subject to regulatory approval that results in a $1.5 million increase based on a 9.75% ROE. We expect to receive a final order midyear 2025. And finally, later today, we'll be making an initial submission related to our next general rate case in California, which is in keeping with the state's 3-year cycle. The California case will seek to recover nearly $750 million in planned investment in pipe replacement resiliency and other important system needs.\nSlide 11 outlines three important pieces of priority legislation for us that were signed into law already in 2025. First, Missouri passed Senate Bill 4. As a result beginning July 1, 2026, water and wastewater utilities may request the use of a future test year and a general rate case for rate base and certain expenses. As you know, our current Missouri general rate case was filed on July 1, 2024. So we expect that our next general rate case in Missouri, we'll request this future test year treatment. This is a positive step for the regulatory and business environment in Missouri.\nTurning to Indiana. Legislatures there passed Senate Bill 426 in March which modifies the existing distribution system improvement charge to allow for the deferral depreciation and post in-service carrying costs from the in-service state of eligible investments until they are included for recovery in rates. The language also provides important protections from lawsuits when utilities are meeting applicable water quality standards.\nThen in Virginia. Senate Bill 850 was passed and will permit a water or wastewater utility to petition the Virginia Commission for the recovery of an expanded list of eligible infrastructure costs outside of a base rate case. Collectively, these three laws represent progress towards achieving [ loud ] returns in each state and are supportive of further investments. I'd like to congratulate our government and external affairs teams who worked alongside many others to help achieve these constructive policies in 2025.\nAnd finally, on Slide 12. As John mentioned, we've affirmed our 2025 EPS guidance, which again represents 8% annual growth. Our outlook and plans for 2025 remain unchanged from our February call. As Cheryl will speak to, we don't expect any of the recent tariff-related announcements to have a material impact on our 2025 plan or financial results. I'm confident in our team's ability to execute on our financial and operating plans and cost management strategies. This includes delivering cost-effective financing, while maintaining our balance sheet strength and credit profile. As we announced in late February, we completed a successful long-term debt issuance of $800 million at a [ 5.25 ] coupon that attracted strong demand.\nThe treasury team did a great job of timely executing part of our financing objectives for the year and [indiscernible] a challenging market environment. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of the end of the quarter, net of $114 million of cash on hand was 58%, which was within our target of less than 60%. Also, as John mentioned, S&P affirmed our A rating in April, which followed Moody's affirmation of our Baa1 investment credit rating in January with a stable outlook from both. Both agencies note advantages of our scale, our low-risk business profile, our strong regulatory and operational diversity across 14 states and our steady financial performance and their analysis. They also noted our expected sustained FFO to debt ratios well within the current rating thresholds. We are confident our business and financial profile, including FFO to debt will continue to support either our current or higher investment-grade credit ratings.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital program, our recent acquisition activity and a look at the state of infrastructure in the U.S. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 14, our capital program is off to a good start this year, investing $518 million in the first quarter. Our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job working through a particularly harsh winter across many of our states. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.3 billion of capital investment in 2025. We continue to expect these capital investments in infrastructure and in acquisitions will grow regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. As our capital investments related to PFAS remediation and lead service line replacement begin to ramp up, we've been asked by investors if the amount or timing of our investments will change. Our answer is still the same. We haven't changed our plans. EPA's rules around PFOS and lead and copper are final regulations. Some of our states also have existing regulations for PFOS and lead and copper. So while we'll continue to monitor for any potential changes in this realm for now, we're moving forward.\nAs I'll note a bit later in my comments, if the capital spend needed to address PFOS and/or lead and copper goes down, we would redeploy it to other important system needs such as pipe replacement. This quarter, we also thought it would be helpful to share a few comments about the potential impact of tariffs on our capital and operating expenses. Our teams analyzed the potential cost increases that could come from tariffs on various raw materials or finished goods that we purchased to serve our customers. The good news, as David alluded to, is that our supply chain is predominantly sourced domestically and therefore, our exposure is very limited on things like fleet purchases, pumps and some construction-related materials. Of course, we'll work to mitigate even that small exposure through our supply chain team and our purchasing power. Related to operating costs, we don't expect any significant tariff-related impacts as most of our key expenses, such as labor, power and chemicals, are primarily sourced domestically. So again, even with the uncertainty around tariffs amidst other uncertainties, I believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis.\nTurning to Slide 15. We continue to be well positioned for growth through acquisitions across many states with about 37,000 customer connections under agreement. I want to highlight three states, in particular, today as we think about our acquisition outlook.\nFirst, in Pennsylvania, already this year, we've received multiple unanimous approvals from the commission to acquire water and wastewater systems. We remain confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline and we are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania, driven by the need for system consolidation and upgrading. A great example of this is the East Dunker water system, which we just closed this week. That system was out of EPA compliance since 2014 and the residents in that community could not trust that the water coming out of their tops was safe to drink. The system was placed into a receivership under Pennsylvania American Water last year and our team has done a phenomenal job in rectifying approximately 75 violations from the state DEP.\nIn Pennsylvania, as in all our states, American Water will continue to be the solution provider to communities who deserve high-quality water and wastewater service.\nNext, you can see that West Virginia has nearly 15,000 customer connections under agreement, our business development team there is doing an excellent job in identifying consolidation opportunities and converting them to signed asset purchase agreements. And finally, in New Jersey, we have a signed purchase agreement for the South Orange water system, which passed a voted referendum last fall. That system is in need of significant follow-up follow-on capital over the next decade, which, in particular, includes a great deal of lead service line replacements.\nTo close on Slide 16, the American Society of Civil Engineer's latest report card for America's infrastructure issued every 4 years since 2001, and recently gave the nation's drinking water systems, a C- grade and wastewater systems, a D-plus grade, both of which are unchanged from the 2021 report card. EPA estimates that our country's water infrastructure needs total $625 billion of investments over the next 20 years, and that estimate keeps going up, not down each time they update their estimates. We believe even that estimate is way too low by a factor of 2 or 3. Aging infrastructure, extreme weather events, and costs associated with regulatory and environmental compliance continue to place increased strain on the nation's water systems. And this strain is generally felt most acutely by small- to medium-sized municipal systems that don't always have the capital or the expertise to address the issues at hand. The need for consolidation of the fragmented U.S. water industry to help solve these problems is dire.\nWithin the communities we already serve, we need to invest $36 billion to $37 billion over the next 10 years to help ensure safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater surface. The solutions needed across the country will require the public and private sectors to work together. Together, we can safeguard public health, incentivize economic investment and ultimately create American jobs.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

David Bowler, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our 2024 financial results, provide rate case updates, discuss our strong financial position heading into 2025 and review our EPS guidance drivers and 5-year financing plan. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment program, our acquisition outlook and we'll conclude with comments on our compelling growth drivers. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by making a few comments on the leadership news detailed in our earnings release last night. There, we announced my retirement as of May 14, 2025, which is the date of our Annual Shareholders Meeting. At that same time, John will become our CEO. This is the next step in the succession plan we laid out in August of last year. The American Water Board is deeply committed to building a strong succession and development strategy at American Water as evidenced by the thoughtful plan. This transition is just a part of that intentional effort to ensure we have the best leadership foundation for the long term throughout the entire organization. John working with Cheryl and the rest of our talented and highly experienced leadership team will continue American Water's strong record of industry leadership and high performance. .\nJohn has more than 25 years of industry knowledge and expertise and significant experience in leading high-performing teams, strategy development and execution. Most importantly, he has a deep understanding of our company's purpose and a strong commitment to our customers, employees and shareholders. I am very proud of the leadership team that we have built at American Water, all of whom are committed to the mission of delivering safe, clean and reliable service to those we have the privilege of serving. The success of this company reflects the cohesive leadership of this entire team.\nI also want to thank all of the employees of American Water. I have been in the utility business for over 40 years now, and it is an absolute privilege to work with you. I'm thankful and humbled by the opportunity to spend the last 6 years in the water industry with each of you. Providing water and wastewater services that improve customers' lives and make communities stronger is a true honor. But before I go, I want to reiterate my belief that American Water continues to be the leader in all aspects of the water and wastewater utility industry in the United States. If you compare our plans to our actual results, you will see that we've consistently executed exactly as we said we would, including our results in 2024 that were squarely in line with our plan. This growing record of consistency continues to solidify the earned trust in our company from investors, analysts and other key stakeholders.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to John to cover 2024 highlights and our affirmed outlook. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Susan. Congratulations. While we still have you until May, let me say what a tremendous privilege it has been for all of us to have worked alongside you over the years. You have made a very significant contribution to American Water's success, and the company is stronger because of your leadership. I'm excited and honored to work alongside this team as CEO starting in May, and now we have a great future ahead of us as we continue to make communities stronger through the critical water and wastewater services we provide.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, and I'll start by covering some highlights of last year. You can see here an abbreviated list of some of our key accomplishments for the year, and David and Cheryl will add these in their remarks. As we announced yesterday, we delivered 2024 financial results right in line with our expectations. Earnings were $5.39 per share for the year, which included $0.12 per share of favorable weather and $0.09 per share of incremental interest income from the AOS note. Our results reflect the clear execution of our plan in 2024, which delivered EPS growth of 8-plus percent. I'm proud of our regulatory and state teams for successfully completing several significant general rate cases this past year. These cases which were driven by needed infrastructure investments punctuate the focus we have on providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable service to over 14 million people across our footprint.\nAnd as you can see, we invested over $3 billion in 2024 to help achieve that mission. This included a solid year for acquisitions, which at nearly 70,000 customer connections met our 2% compounded annual growth target. Overall, I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably this past year. I believe the takeaway today for investors is that our strong execution in 2024 coupled with our low-risk top-tier capital growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm confident we will execute on our plans for 2025 and beyond building on the momentum we have from 2024.\nTurning to Slide 7. We are affirming our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 per share. This represents our expectation of 8% EPS growth in 2025 compared to our weather-normalized 2024 EPS. The comments that we'll share today are an affirmation of the financial plan, long-term targets and guidance we laid out last fall, highlighted by 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth and driven by 8% to 9% rate base growth. We have a geographic footprint and resulting regulatory diversity that is rivaled by few. This, along with our capital plan that has decades of basic infrastructure renewal at its core, drives the low-risk nature of our growth plans. Along with our affordability and sustainability leadership, I believe American Water offers a top-tier shareholder return opportunity and merits our position as a premium regulated utility.\nIn closing, on Slide 8, I want to emphasize that we expect to achieve consistent EPS growth well within the 7% to 9% range through 2029 and beyond. We have demonstrated during these last few years and with our guidance for 2025 that our business plan is strong and compelling. Our commitment to solving problems for our customers remains steadfast, including addressing aging infrastructure and water quality challenges. This foundation, coupled with the capital investment needs that lie ahead, uniquely positions American Water to achieve consistently strong earnings and dividend growth for many years to come.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to David to cover our financial results, rate case updates and balance sheet strength in further detail. David?\n\nDavid M. Bowler\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, I'd like to also congratulate Susan on her upcoming retirement, and John on his succession into the CEO role. So I echo John's comments on it being a pleasure to work with you over the years, you will certainly be missed by all of us here.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Let me provide a few more details on 2024 results as compared to 2023. You will also find details of fourth quarter results in the appendix. Consolidated reported earnings were $5.39 per share in 2024, higher by $0.49 per share compared to 2023. As John noted, earnings in 2024 benefited from an estimated $0.12 per share as a result of revenue from drier-than-normal weather expense across our states as compared to $0.13 per share of favorable weather in 2023. Excluding the impacts of weather, revenues were higher by $1.28 per share, primarily due to authorized rate increases from general rate cases and infrastructure surcharges to recover investment across our states. Revenues were also higher from closed water and lease water acquisitions, organic customer growth and an increase from changes in customer demand. One additional item to note is that purchase water cost which were higher by $0.08 per share year-over-year have been netted against revenues, as these costs are generally recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nAnd looking at operating costs, O&M was higher by $0.22 per share driven priorly by employee-related costs and other increases that support growth in the business as we expected. Production costs related to fuel, power and chemicals were also slightly higher compared to 2023. Next, general taxes, which were comprised of property and gross receipts taxes were higher by $0.05 per share with the increase in property taxes tied to the level of capital investment and higher grocery seats tax driven by higher revenue, primarily in New Jersey. Depreciation increased $0.31 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.33 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth.\nFinally, we had $0.09 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the note related to the sale of homeowner services. We will continue to break this out quarterly, so investors can track the ongoing growth of American Water from our core regulated strategy without this additional interest income.\nTurning to Slide 11. We summarized the 7 rate cases we successfully completed in 2024, 5 of which we covered on prior calls. In the fourth quarter, we received orders in Illinois and California as well as an updated final order in Kentucky. In December, the Illinois Commission approved an additional $105 million in annualized revenues effective January 1, 2025. This order includes an allowed return on equity of 9.84% and an equity layer of 49%, both of which were consistent with our last rate case in Illinois. We continue to believe that Illinois is a constructive environment for American Water and is supportive of the investment to continue to provide safe and reliable service for the benefit of our Illinois American Water customers.\nSwitching over to California, also in December, the commission there approved and adopted a partial settlement agreement providing incremental annualized revenues of $53 million over 3 years, beginning with rates retroactive to January 1, 2024. The commission's decision included a partial decoupling mechanism and approval of an important sales adjustment mechanism that allows annual updates on forecast of water cells to ratemaking purposes. While the decision didn't recognize the importance of a full decoupling mechanism and promoting affordable rates and conservation. We filed an application in December for rehearing with the commission and are exploring other avenues to ensure that customers can achieve the benefits associated with decoupling.\nAlso in California, the commission granted the request for an additional 1-year extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2026, which will set the authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2027. Our authorized ROE in California will remain at 10.2% through December 31, 2026. And finally, in Kentucky, the Public Service Commission approved a final order providing for $17 million of annualized increases in water revenues, which is higher by about $6 million from the initial order in May of 2024. As a reminder, received in May, we filed a motion for clarification on their authorized amount of annualized revenues in this case. New rates provided in the final order were effective November 6.\nTurning to Slide 12. You can see we have general rate cases and progress in 4 jurisdictions. The most prominent rate case for us this year is in Missouri, where we are seeking recovery of $1.1 billion of capital investments. hearing to begin at the end of this month and settlement discussions are underway ahead of [indiscernible] due at the end of March. We expect new rates to go into effect in the middle of 2025. Overall, the key parties, in this case, have filed similar positions as they did in our prior case 2 years ago, which was settled. As a reminder, in this case, the commission allows all parties to propose specific adjustments beyond December 31, 2024, and we have proposed to capture investments through May 2025.\nSeparately, we are continuing to work alongside an informal coalition of water and gas utilities in Missouri on a legislative path for a future test year. and have supported the introduction of 4 separate bills in the current session related to that effort. The Missouri legislative session ends on May 16. Finally, in Virginia, the filed stipulation of settlement remains subject to commission review and approval, which we are waiting.\nOne quick note at the bottom of the slide. We now provide a list of the dates we filed our most recent general rate cases by state. As we've said in the past, we expect to file rate cases about every 2 years as supported by our ongoing investments to continue to provide safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater services for the long-term benefit of our customers.\nTurning to Slide 13. Let's review the strength of our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity position as we began 2025. Our total debt-to-cap ratio at the end of the year, net of $96 million of cash on hand was 57%, which was well within our target of less than 60%. Investors can expect our company to continue to be focused on this target over the long term. We remain A-rated at S&P with a stable outlook. And just last month, Moody's affirmed our solid BAA1 investment-grade credit rating in [ State Wille ]. Both agencies note our scale, strong regulatory and operational diversity across 14 states, low-risk business and our steady financial performance and their analysis. They also know our trend of credit supportive regulatory outcomes and expected sustained FFO to debt ratios well within the current rating thresholds.\nWe are confident our business and financial profile, including FFO to debt will continue to support either our current or higher investment-grade credit ratings. From this position of balance sheet strength, let's turn to Slide 14 for a review of our guidance and 5-year financing plan. As John mentioned, we affirmed our 2025 EPS guidance, which again represents 8% annual growth. The backbone of the plan continues to be earning our allowed returns on capital we invest to serve our customers while prudently managing operating costs so that we can deliver on our customer affordability target. It's really that simple.\nAs a reminder, our 2025 guidance range includes $0.10 per share of incremental interest income from the amendment of the HOS note a year ago which is on top of the interest income from the original note terms that we are replacing with earnings from the regulated business. As we've said in the past, repayment of the note is a component of our long-term financing plan as a source of funding for our growth. We are also confirming our financing plan shared last fall, now covering 2025 to 2029. As we said previously, the plan includes an estimated total $2.5 billion of external equity issuances with no equity planned for 2025. The level and timing of external equity is tied very simply to our need to fund growth and maintain our strong financial position.\nBased on our current projections of capital spending and cash flows, we currently expect to issue $1 billion of equity at some point in 2026 and $1.5 billion in 2029. The timing of future equity is subject to market conditions as well as the underlying assumptions around our projected CapEx and cash flows. Since we are already in alignment with our targets for debt to cap and dividend payout ratios, we have the flexibility to adjust these plans and respond to market conditions if and when they change for the benefit of our customers and investors alike. Overall, investors should expect equity financing to occur routinely as determined by our investment program, break case cycle and as appropriate to maintain our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Finally, I'll wrap up by noting that our financing plan for calendar year 2025 includes $1.5 billion to $2 billion of long-term debt financing.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital program our recent acquisition activity and a look at our key growth drivers. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing John and David's comments about Susan and I have worked closely together over the past 6 years, and I'm a better leader as a result of that time together, and American Water is definitely stronger because of her time here. I'm excited about John's leadership and in his new role, I know we're going to accomplish great things over the next years.\nOn Slide 16, we have combined a few slides to show a more comprehensive view of our investment program that is always managed with an eye on customer affordability. I want to start by acknowledging that our teams have done a great job executing our capital investment plans these last few years. We have consistently met our capital deployment goal each year and we've done it again in 2024 by investing $3.3 billion, which includes the acquisition investments that I'll speak about later. These investments represented by hundreds of discrete projects are crucial to continuing to deliver safe, and clean water and support continued reliability of service to our customers. We expect these capital investments in infrastructure and acquisitions to grow regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%.\nWe believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. We, of course, remain very focused on balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the necessary system investments in our plan. Customer affordability is a key variable in our annual capital planning analysis. We believe that the average residential water bill across our footprint will continue to be at or below 1% of median household income throughout our 10-year plan.\nThe pie chart on the bottom right side of the page shows the breakdown of our capital spend by purpose over the next decade. While the majority of our capital is dedicated to basic replacement of aging pipes we are also focused on fortifying our systems through resilient spending and making investments in water quality projects to allow our systems to continue to meet our own high standards of compliance.\nTurning to Slide 17. I'm proud to report that we had a solid year of investment in regulated acquisitions, successfully closing on 13 systems totaling $417 million, which added nearly 70,000 new customers. Looking ahead, we continue to be well positioned for strong growth through acquisitions across many states with over 24,000 customer connections under agreement as of the beginning of the year. We've added significant business development capability over the last few years across our footprint and we're confident these investments and additional resources and enhanced processes will help us meet our compounded annual growth rate target of 2% for customers added through acquisitions.\nOverall, we expect to continue to invest about $300 million to $400 million on average each year in acquisitions, a small but important part of our over $3 billion capital plan. We expect growth through acquisitions will become more consistent on an annual basis over time, but will remain lumpier than our organic CapEx as time lines for details can shift throughout the closing process. If and when that happens, we have the flexibility to reallocate and easily replace these acquisition dollars with various other projects to meet system needs such as additional replacements of aging pipes.\nTo close on Slide 18, today, you've heard a recap of our long-term strategy, which should sound very consistent. Beyond our words, though, I believe we have a proven track record of executing on our plans, including achieving our EPS guidance year after year. I fully expect 2025 to be another successful year demonstrating this execution. Slide 18 is a compilation of the predictable and steady growth drivers for American Water that differentiate our growth trajectory from other utilities enable us to stand out as a premium utility. We replaced approximately 400 miles of pipe in 2024. This replacement effort reflects our commitment to reliable service with the work prioritized by need.\nThe prioritization is balanced by affordability and cost of material, labor, permitting, restoration and an annual increase in the actual amount of miles of pipe we have acquired via acquisitions. Our mission to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to the customers we are privileged to serve is the foundation for all we do. As our team has said, we're confident we can fulfill this mission and provide a fair return to our investors. American Water has been doing this work for [ deck ], but there is much left to be done, and we must have agency in our work.\nAs we've witnessed in West Virginia, for example, our teams provided assistance to 6 different municipal systems in January alone that we're dealing with service disruptions due to extreme weather and the inability to keep up with leaks. In one of those towns, a local elementary school was without water service for more than 2 weeks until we provided a 7,000 gallon tanker to supply water directly to the school. We will continue to do this critical work and execute on our regulatory, operational and financial plans, which we believe will drive the superior returns our investors expect. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Danielle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nLet me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the second quarter earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nAnd finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter and first half of 2024. Earnings were $1.42 per share for the quarter compared to $1.44 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2024 and 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share. The results for both periods were in line with our expectations. Our expectations were based on the timing of revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings and infrastructure mechanism filings expected to be effective in the latter half of 2024, which I'll speak more about shortly.\nWith our year-to-date execution and customer usage declines being a bit less than we had planned for so far in 2024, we have raised our 2024 EPS guidance by narrowing it to the top half of the guidance range. Our expectations for 2024 are now $5.25 per share to $5.30 per share. John will share more about our results and guidance a bit later.\nMoving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024. We invested $1.4 billion in capital projects year-to-date, again, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. We were also very pleased to add 43,000 customers in our first half of the year from acquisitions and organic growth.\nOur outlook for future acquisitions remains very strong as we have nearly $500 million in acquisitions under agreement. And earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report for 2023. It reflects how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable manner to American Water customers. This has been our mission for over 135 years and counting.\nTurning to Slide 6 and back to the topic of regulatory recovery. I want to acknowledge the great work of our state and corporate regulatory teams as they continue to successfully execute on our regulatory strategy. We have completed 4 cases already in 2024 in Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, all of which authorized 100% of the capital investments we have made or will make in each state. We also have several other general rate cases and timely infrastructure recovery mechanisms currently in front of regulators that I'm confident will be reasonably decided. Cheryl will provide some additional updates on our active general rate cases a little later.\nLet's zoom out for a minute though. I want to remind investors that we strategically choose to operate in a diverse set of regulatory environments that we believe have been and will remain supportive of water and wastewater utility investments and consolidation. As I told you earlier this year, American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work that we do across our footprint. Policymakers in our states often understand that historic $20 or $30 per month water bills don't equate to adequately invested systems or the highest quality services for residents. Those relatively low legacy rates often signal significant underinvestment below average reliability and/or water quality, wastewater overflow issues or all of the above. That's why policymakers frequently encourage American Water to keep growing, keep investing and keep solving problems in their states.\nWe often are called on by regulators and policymakers when there is a need for experts to take over a failing community water system. We have a very recent example of just that in the state of Pennsylvania. As you know, we just completed our rate case in Pennsylvania, and the commission released its order in that case on July 22. It was a case that reflected $1 billion of investments since our last case, which was decided just a short 18 months ago. It's important to note that the commission approved 100% of the capital invested or to be invested by the end of the future test year of June 30, 2025.\nThere is no dispute about the investments being made and the absolute need for the investment to continue to update our systems to ensure that citizens of Pennsylvania, where we operate are confident in their water and wastewater service. Certainly, we received comments about the pace of our regulatory strategy in Pennsylvania. What drives that pace is the need, plain and simple. And of course, that pace of investment leads to increased customer bills. We are focused on that issue in every aspect of our regulatory planning and the efforts we continue to drive to ensure customer affordability, from cost management and driving efficiencies to innovative tariff approaches to a direct customer assistance. At the end of the day, though, the need for investment is not decreasing.\nAs you assess the recent Pennsylvania order outcome, it's helpful to understand the reconciliation of the order findings to our request. Really, there are only 2 or 3 things that reconcile the full difference. If you recall that we requested a revenue increase of about $200 million and an ROE of 10.95%. An ROE request, which is fully reflective of an increasingly risky business because of higher capital costs, new and emerging regulations and an increasing need for resiliency to name just a few of the drivers. The ROE differential between our request and the commission's unprecedented and, frankly, unsupported finding of 9.45% is $71 million of revenue.\nAdditionally, the Butler Area Sewer Authority acquisition, though fully approved by the commission previously was removed from the revenue requirement because the transaction has not yet closed. That impact is $23 million of requested revenue. The remaining $11 million delta from our request to the final authorized revenue requirement is made up of a few cost of service items.\nIn summary, the order found our request to be fully reasonable, but for the ROE finding. We will continue to be very present in Pennsylvania as we serve our customers, but we will evaluate what the -- what this result means to our overall allocation of capital investment among our various states. Investors certainly expect a fair return, and it is part of our mission to provide that opportunity while fully serving our customers.\nSelectively, we believe there is a very long runway of investment opportunities in the communities we serve across our 14 states for organic CapEx and for growth through acquisitions. And further, we believe the regulatory and legislative environments in our 14 states continue to be conducive to earning a fair and reasonable return on the investments we're making and that you, our investors, are counting on. We do all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service and sustainable operations, which leads us to Slide 7 and what I believe are the drivers of American Water's very competitive and sustainable shareholder return, built on the foundation of the regulatory execution I just discussed.\nThis quarter, we are again affirming our long-term targets, including both earnings and dividend growth targets at an industry-leading pace of 7% to 9% over the next 5 years and beyond. This affirmation is based on our clear top tier growth -- capital growth plan and our solid regulatory and operational execution. Our track record of execution on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets.\nFinally, let me spend just a few minutes on the leadership news we detailed in our earnings release. I'm excited to relay John has been named President of American Water. This is a decision in the American Water Board, and I have worked on for some time, and it really is about our intentional effort to build a pipeline of talent through career development to ensure we have a strong leadership foundation for the long term. With this shift, I will continue to lead the overall strategic direction of our company as the CEO and as an American Water Board member. John will lead the continued execution of our strategies and daily operations. He will continue to report to me and our executive leadership team will report to John.\nCheryl will expand her COO role and now lead business development. When you consider how she has led our increased capital program, her extensive water quality expertise given the ever-increasing regulations and her reputation in this industry, this is a natural expansion of her role as we continue to bring solutions to even more communities across the country.\nDavid [ Butler ], who you will hear from next quarter, has been named Executive Vice President and CFO; and [ Nick Furie ] has been named Vice President and Treasurer.\nLet me just say a few words about John, Cheryl, David and Nick as we are really pleased to have all 4 expand their roles. You know John well. He has more than 25 years of industry knowledge and expertise and significant experience in leading high-performance teams, strategy development and execution. Most importantly, he has a deep understanding of our company's purpose, and a strong commitment to our customers, employees and shareholders.\nCheryl has more than 35 years of experience and expertise. She has led our lab, served as President in 3 of our states and does an incredible job leading all areas of our operations. She too has a strong sense of the purpose of American Water.\nDavid has nearly 20 years of deep experience in the utility industry and has been our Deputy CFO and Treasurer since 2022. He has significant experience in all aspects of financial management and strategy, including finance, strategy and planning, treasury, accounting, enterprise risk and capital markets.\nAnd Nick [ Furie ] has 10 years of experience with American Water and has served as our Assistant Treasurer since 2021, overseeing key treasury-related functions including financing, cash flow, liquidity, overall CAP structure management. He also served as the Director of acquisitions at American Water and has nearly 20 years of experience in accounting and finance roles.\nAll have a strong commitment to the success of our company and are well suited for their new and expanded roles. We firmly believe we have further solidified an already top talent leadership team. Our leadership team and the American Water Board of Directors are excited about these changes and highly confident this team will support the execution of our plans now and well into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our recent regulatory updates, affordability and the capital plan. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am about today's leadership news, and I look forward to working even more closely with our business development team to provide water and wastewater solutions to many more new communities. I'm also very confident that we have the right team for the long-term success of this company.\nOn Slide 9, I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. In Pennsylvania, as Susan just laid out, the commission issued an order in July authorizing an additional $99 million in annualized revenues effective August 7. There are 2 other items from the order worth noting. The PUC encouraged Pennsylvania American Water to set a target donation to its hardship fund of an additional $1 million. Of note, as part of its acquisition of the Butler Area Sewer Authority, Pennsylvania American Water already committed to increase its shareholder contribution to the H2O Help to Others grant program by $3.5 million over 5 years. As you know, the BASA acquisition was approved by the PUC in November of 2023, but it was appealed to the Commonwealth Court, so the PUC approved expansion of these assistance programs awaits the decision from that court.\nRegarding the water quality issues raised in the order, we acknowledge that some customers in the Northeast part of our Pennsylvania service area experienced temporary aesthetic disturbances associated with system improvements and operational maintenance. Let me be clear, our water meets all state and federal drinking water regulations. We take customer comments about water quality very seriously, and we'll work with the commission on the matters raised. As part of this commitment, we attempted personal outreach to every customer who raised a water quality concern during the public hearings to better understand and resolve their issues.\nWith 33 Pennsylvania American Waters water treatment plants nationally recognized with the Directors awards for participating in the EPA's partnership for Safewater, we are fully committed to high quality, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services.\nSwitching over to Kentucky, the commission there issued an order on May 3, authorizing an additional $11 million in annualized revenues. Since the company had implemented interim rates effective February 6 based on the requested revenue of $26 million, the order requires a refund with interest to customers retroactive to this date. It does not include the infrastructure surcharge revenues of $10 million, which add to our investment recovery in the state. We filed with the commission a petition for rehearing of the rate case order seeking clarification or correction of certain quantifications with respect to the authorized amount of annualized revenues. Of the handful of issues we have raised, the one of most significance appears to be a mathematical error that once corrected would result in a higher revenue requirement. We expect resolution of this proceeding later in 2024.\nTurning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in 7 jurisdictions. All of these cases are centered around the capital investments we've made and will continue to make in these states, and all of them are proceeding as we expected.\nOn July 1, we filed a general rate case in Missouri, reflecting a $1.5 billion in system investments covering January 2023 through May 2026. We are seeking $148 million of additional annual revenue. Rate cases in Missouri usually take up to 11 months, and we expect new rates to become effective mid-2025.\nIn Illinois, the next milestones in the case will be evidentiary hearings in August, followed by briefing from all parties in September and then a proposed order due in October.\nIn California, we still expect a final rate case decision in the second half of 2024. New rates will be implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024. As a reminder, we reached a partial settlement agreement in November of 2023 with the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, which would address our revenue requirement request, but does not address rate design or certain other matters including our request for continuation of a revenue stability mechanism.\nAlso of note, the California Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion concluding that the commission aired when it prohibited water utilities from proposing to continue their water revenue adjustment mechanisms. Accordingly, the court vacated the portion of the commission's 2020 decision relating to this provision. Decoupling is a critical tool for conservation efforts in California. Adequate water supply reliability for all uses is essential to the future economic and environmental health of the communities we serve there.\nIn New Jersey, as outlined in the procedural schedule, the company is in confidential settlement discussions among the parties to the proceeding and we hope to have a resolution soon.\nTo show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 10 that we have $266 million in annualized new revenues and rates so far in 2024. This includes $176 million from general rate cases and step increases and $90 million from infrastructure surcharges. In total, we have $546 million of total annualized revenue request pending. Most of the annual authorized revenues we are expecting in 2024 have effective dates, which will have a stronger impact on financial results in the second half of the year.\nMoving to Slide 11 and a topic you've heard us cover just about every quarter, customer affordability. And as we've said, we are very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. An example of this is included in the Missouri general rate case we filed on July 1. We are proposing a new income-based discounted rate for customers below 150% of the federal poverty level. We also currently offer assistance through our H2O Help to Other program, which is available to any Missouri American Water customer and meets the basic needs criteria as set by the community action agency case workers.\nWe also continue to strongly advocate for a permanent federally funded low-income water assistance program similar to what's been in place for many years for gas and electric utility customers and what was temporarily in place for water customers during COVID.\nTurning to Slide 12. As Susan reviewed earlier, highlighted here is an example of the constructive regulatory and legislative environments we operate in. Our theme here is not only around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs, but also around offering affordability programs and tariffs to those customers who need it the most. As I alluded to earlier, American Water has consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators over the years to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure to serve the long-term best interest of our customers, while also achieving timely recovery. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it promotes affordability by leveling out customer bill impacts over time, making those bills more manageable for our customers.\nI'd like to point out that we offer affordability programs in most of our states, which is something we have been doing for some time now. We also have specific low-income tariffs enacted in 4 of our biggest states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and West Virginia. And as I mentioned on the last slide, we are seeking to add Missouri to this list once our general rate case concludes next year.\nLastly, Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams, again, did a great job in the quarter, executing on our increased capital plan. They safely completed the hundreds of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by almost $200 million in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.1 billion of capital investment in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. I, too, look forward to all of our new roles. We have a great future ahead of us and much work to do as we continue to make communities stronger through the essential water and wastewater services we provide.\nTurning to Slide 15. I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.42 per share for the quarter down $0.02 per share versus the same period in 2023, but up $0.02 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Recently completed rate cases in Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year are driving increased revenues. While weather led to a net unfavorable impact on earnings, quarter-over-quarter of an estimated $0.04 per share, earnings in the second quarter of 2024 were favorably impacted by an estimated $0.03 per share of weather due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in New Jersey while earnings were favorably impacted in Q2 of 2023 by an estimated $0.07 per share of weather due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nIn looking at operating costs, increased employee-related costs caused O&M to increase $0.03 per share as expected from normal wage increases somewhat offset by lower headcount. Production costs related to fuel, power and chemical costs were flat compared to this period in 2023.\nNext, depreciation increased $0.07 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.11 per share both as expected in support of our investment growth. Long-term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note issuance from last June and the $1.4 billion long-term senior note issuance this February.\nAnd finally, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS. We will continue to break this out quarterly so investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy without this additional interest income.\nTurning to Slide 16. Earnings were flat for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.04 per share year-to-date which, as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year.\nTurning to our discussion of growth through acquisitions. On Slide 17, you'll see that we successfully closed on 5 systems for $119 million through June 30, which added approximately 33,400 new customers. The newest additions include the water and wastewater systems in sale in New Jersey and Cape Charles, Virginia, which followed the Granite City, Illinois wastewater treatment plant acquisition we closed in Q1. We've also added 9,600 customers through organic growth through June 30.\nWe continue to be well positioned for strong growth through acquisitions with 59,000 customer connections and $483 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad-based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country. As a reminder, we have received PUC approval for the acquisition of the 15,000 customer wastewater system in Pennsylvania. The PUC's approval is under appeal and we await a decision from the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court to proceed with closing.\nOn June 13, the Pennsylvania Commission voted to adopt revisions to procedures around Act 12 fair market value. The provisions in this final order were largely the same as the proposed version we covered on the first quarter call. And as we said on the first quarter call, we believe these provisions are a constructive step for continued consolidation in Pennsylvania as they reaffirmed the core principles of Act 12. We do expect the closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline.\nSlide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial position. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of June 30, net of our $48 million of cash on hand is 56%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%.\nAnd finally, on Slide 19, yesterday, we announced that we are raising our 2024 EPS guidance by narrowing it to the top half of the range we first disclosed in February. The 2024 EPS guidance range is now $5.25 to $5.30 from $5.20 to $5.30 previously and still on a weather-normalized basis. As Susan mentioned, this change is driven by lower-than-expected declines in customer usage, which is something we track closely and now believe we can count on for the remainder of the year. Coupled with the fact that we have several revenue increases effective in Q2 and Q3, we expect second half 2024 will deliver financial results to achieve this narrowed guidance range. This puts us on track to deliver 8.5% EPS growth in 2024 at the new midpoint.\nOur high-level outlook for 2024 otherwise remains unchanged from what we previously disclosed and we again affirm our long-term financial targets. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth, coupled with our affordability position and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and our position as the largest and most geographically diversified water and wastewater utilities in the country distinguish us from all other utilities. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musk, you may begin\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Betsy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the first quarter earnings release and in our March 31 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nAnd finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share referred to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we started 2024 with solid financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter compared to $0.91 last year. The increased results were as we expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we are pleased to affirm.\nFirst quarter 2024 results included $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS, which reflected the higher interest rate and the successful earn-out of the $75 million contingent consideration as we detailed in our February call. Here, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks.\nAs we announced in late February, we completed a successful long-term debt issuance of $1.4 billion. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2024 financing plan. We also invested well over $600 million of capital in infrastructure this quarter. In addition, we completed a large acquisition and filed general rate cases in several states in accordance with the traditional process of earning a return on the capital investments we have made. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value for quality service and sustainable operations, which we highlighted in our disclosures we published in early April as noted on this slide.\nThe other significant news so far in 2024 for us and the water industry as a whole came on April 10 when the EPA announced the final national primary drinking water regulations for 6 PFAS chemicals. Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS water quality standards, but I want to reiterate that we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality.\nI want to again assure our customers regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise to tackle this issue head on. And in fact, we have demonstrated that in many locations for some time now.\nTurning to Slide 6. This quarter, we again -- we are, again, affirming our long-term targets for both earnings and dividend growth at 7% to 9%. This affirmation is based upon clear top-tier capital growth plan and our strong regulatory and operational execution that I believe is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long-term plans, growing earnings and dividends at an industry-leading pace over the next 5 years and beyond.\nMoving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from [ $0.71 ] per share to $0.765 per share, an 8.1% increase. We have grown our dividend consistently over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing virtually all of our utility peers, while maintaining a consistent payout ratio of less than 60%.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to our investors.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about PFAS recent regulatory updates, affordability and rate base growth. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to Slide 9 and reviewing the USEPA drinking water rule on PFAS published in April. As Susan stated, we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges that the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability.\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the U.S. water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. EPA's final rule was unchanged in terms of the drinking water limit of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFAS. However, the federal time line to comply was extended from 3 years to 5 years in the final rule.\nThe federal compliance window now includes the 2-year extension that states would have been allowed to grant the water systems for capital improvements. As always, we will work with our state regulators to incorporate any additional state specific guidance related to implementing the new federal rule, including on maximum contaminant level guidelines. Based upon our preliminary analysis of this new PFAS rule and assuming states don't adopt more stringent limits, we currently do not anticipate any change to our estimate of $1 billion of capital and our estimate of up to $50 million annually of operating expenses to comply with the rule.\nWe also do not currently expect the new limits set by the EPA for 3 additional PFAS compounds to impact these estimates. Through a separate rule-making in April, U.S. EPA also designated PFOA and PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. As a reminder, we continue to actively advocate and support bipartisan federal legislation that would provide PFAS liability protections under CERCLA for water and wastewater systems as passive receivers of PFAS.\nPreviously, we've disclosed that we remained a party to 2 settlements so far with 3M and DuPont coming out of the multi-district litigation, or MDL lawsuit. As we shared, we believe this is the best path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in an expedient manner for our customers. The MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont and 3M settlements in February and March of this year, respectively. The amount of proceeds to be received from each settlement is still pending.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. In West Virginia, the commission issued an order authorizing an additional $18 million in annualized revenues effective February 25. We also received an order for $7 million of additional revenue related to our DSIC request, effective March 1.\nIn Indiana, the commission issued an order authorizing an additional $66 million in annualized revenues effective over a phased 3-step process through May 2025. They also approved a new rate design that provides 1,500 gallons of water usage at no additional cost above the fixed monthly customer charge for all water customers. The change will allow Indiana American to provide low-cost basic water service for customers on fixed incomes that use a lower volume of water than the typical residential customer. With this change, the cost for the typical residential water customer using 1,500 gallons will be approximately $20 per month. This is just one example of the many innovative ways we are addressing customer affordability.\nTurning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in 8 jurisdictions. All of these cases are centered around the capital investments we've made and will continue to make in these states. Our cases in California, Virginia, New Jersey and Illinois are progressing well as expected. In Illinois, the next milestones in the case will be staff and intervener testimony in May, followed by our rebuttal in June. In New Jersey, the next milestones in the case will be staff and intervener testimony in July, followed by our rebuttal in September and evidentiary hearings in October.\nIn Kentucky, we expect an order any day now as the story deadline for the commission to act is May 7. Interim rates in Kentucky were implemented in February 6. In Pennsylvania, we expect new rates to be effective in August for the case we filed last year that was driven by $1 billion of vital capital investment. The next milestones expected in the case are a proposed decision from the ALJ likely in May and a final order in July. We expect a constructive outcome that reflects the state of Pennsylvania's long-standing support for needed capital investment that improves infrastructure for the benefit of customers.\nAnd finally, on the rate case front, just yesterday, we filed general rate cases in Iowa and Tennessee. And last week, we filed notice with the Missouri Public Service Commission that we plan to file a case by midyear. On the legislative front, 3 state bills were passed and signed that will incrementally help water utilities in those states in the areas of [ lead ] service line replacements, expediency of approval of smaller acquisitions and fire hydrant maintenance.\nTo show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 11 that we have $98 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January. This includes $43 million from general rate cases and step increases and $55 million from infrastructure surcharges. In total, we have $636 million of total annualized revenue request pending.\nMoving to Slide 12 and a topic you've heard us cover just about every quarter, customer affordability. As we've said, we are very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. Our system-wide average residential water customer bill is $55 to $65 per month. The investment plan we have in place will allow us to stay within our consolidated target for residential water bills of 1% or less of median household income. That analysis is supported by U.S. Census Bureau data specific to the geographies we serve that project rising levels of median household income in these communities.\nAt the same time, we realize we must continue to involve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability, as I described earlier, with what we're doing in Indiana as an example. As another example, just last month, California American Water announced an additional $8 million in bill relief for customers who faced financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding comes through a California program that utilizes Federal American Rescue Plan Act funds. This brings the total benefit for challenged California American Water customers to $15 million under the program. We also continue to strongly advocate for a permanent federally funded low-income water assistance program, similar to what's been in place for many years for electric and gas utility customers. And we are continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and cost management to deliver on customer affordability especially as regulatory demands such as the final PFAS rule and the proposed lead and copper rule improvement increased capital needs.\nLastly, Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter, executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the hundreds of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by almost $200 million in the quarter, compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.1 billion of capital investment in 2024.\nThe pie charts on the right side of the page speak to timely recovery and the nature of our investments across our footprint. As we share with regulators and legislators, our capital spending is driven by a risk-based strategy, balanced by a focus on affordability. For us, infrastructure renewal includes the basics of replacing older damaged pipe, but it also includes proactively meeting our standards related to lead service line replacements. As we have said many times before, we firmly believe removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers.\nThrough capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This not only helps us to seek to earn our allowed return, but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect at least 75% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to driving modest bill increases and to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 15, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2023. As Cheryl mentioned, we have completed rate cases recently in Indiana and West Virginia in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year and we are seeing increased revenues as a result.\nAnd looking at O&M, production costs from increased fuel, power and chemicals as well as increased employee-related costs caused O&M to increase $0.07 per share. Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.11 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth. Long-term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note we issued last June and the $1.4 billion long-term senior note issued in February along with $0.04 of dilution related to the $1.7 billion of equity we issued last March.\nShort-term financing provided a benefit of $0.07 per share, primarily from interest earned on the cash reserves we held during the quarter. Other net consists of net unfavorable onetime nonoperating items year-over-year. And finally, as Susan mentioned, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS.\nWe will continue to break this out quarterly, so our investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from our core regulated strategy without this additional interest income.\nOn Slide 16, you'll see that we successfully closed on the Granite City, Illinois wastewater treatment plant acquisition in the first quarter. This acquisition will help ensure we can provide high-quality service to the customers in Granite City we already serve. We continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions with over 60,000 customer connections and over $500 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad-based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country.\nOf the over 60,000 customers represented by signed agreements, nearly 20,000 have already been approved by the State Public Utility Commission. This includes the 15,000 customers in the Butler Area Sewer Authority, or BASA wastewater system acquisition in Pennsylvania. We continue to expect BASA to close in the near future. This also includes the water and wastewater systems in Cape Charles, Virginia, which we closed just last week and marked the second acquisition completed under Virginia's fair market value law enacted in 2020. We look forward to serving our new Cape Charles customers.\nAs we've discussed before and as we lay out on this slide, the environment in Pennsylvania related to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive. We are very confident that the core principles of the original Act 12, fair market value law, will remain in place and continue to have good support since so much consolidation is still needed in Pennsylvania to address the underinvestment in infrastructure. In the meantime, closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline.\nWe are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania driven by the need for system consolidation and upgrading all for the benefit of communities who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service.\nSlide 17 summarizes our successful long-term debt financing completed in February. The offering was for $1.4 billion and included $700 million of 10-year notes at 5.15% and $700 million of 30-year notes at 5.45%. Our treasury team did a very nice job proactively executing on our main financing plan objective for the year amidst a challenging interest rate environment. These proceeds will fund our regulated businesses growth and were used to pay off a maturing senior note and outstanding commercial paper of which we had a 0 balance at quarter end.\nThough the current higher interest rate environment is challenging, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders.\nAnd finally, Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition. In March, S&P affirmed our solid single A investment-grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio, which followed Moody's affirmation of its rating and outlook for us in January. We are confident our FFO to debt ratio will continue to support our current credit ratings. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of March 31 net of our $584 million of cash on hand is 56%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%.\nIn closing, what you've heard today should sound very familiar. Our focus is on execution at every level. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and strategy separate us from all other utilities. Our execution includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to our operator and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website.

Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2023 with very strong financial results that were right on plan. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $4.90 per share for the year, which included $0.13 per share of favorable weather, most of which we discussed earlier in the year. Excluding the estimated weather impact, earnings of $4.77 per share were at the midpoint of the guidance range we shared originally back in November of 2022.\nI'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably through numerous economic events this past year, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we had for 2023. And I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver and especially over the past few months during a cold January and active storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses and communities.\nYou can see here on Slide 5, an abbreviated list of some of our key accomplishments in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors is that our strong execution in 2023 amid the challenging macro backdrop, coupled with our clear top tier growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we will execute our plans in 2024 and beyond with the great momentum we have from 2023.\nTurning to Slide 6. As you can see, we have delivered an excellent total shareholder return over the past 5 and 10 years, including our growing record of significant dividend increases. We're proud of this history, which compares very favorably to other utilities. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and utility stocks in general did not perform nearly as well as the S&P 500 in 2023, which dampened the outperformance we've had versus the S&P 500 over the last decade or so.\nRelative valuations of utility stocks fell without regard to specific performance. All of that, while we continued our very strong performance. I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will continue to produce superior shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for years to come, which takes us to Slide 7. The comments that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of the financial plan, long-term targets and guidance we laid out last November, highlighted by 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth.\nLater, John will recap the drivers for our growth in 2024, including the increase to our EPS guidance range that we announced yesterday. Big picture, though, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth are low-risk capital plan, our ESG leadership and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from other utilities in this sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2028 in our 5-year plan and beyond that.\nThis, of course, is driven by significant investments in infrastructure and acquisitions, coupled with our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, all with a keen focus on affordability. And on top of all of that, we continue to grow organically, including in our military services business that successfully serves 18 military installations across the country. One final thought I want to leave you with as we begin 2024. American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work we do across the country. The impact we are making in communities across our 14 states to improve water and wastewater service is critical to the well-being of the citizens we are proud to serve.\nAs we've told you many times, we are committed to solving local infrastructure issues, while at the same time, driving efficiencies in our business to remain very affordable to our customers. Policymakers frequently encourage our leadership to keep growing, keep investing and keep solving problems in their states. And this includes Pennsylvania, where we applaud the Public Utility Commission's proposal on February 1 to enhance the process around the implementation of fair market value legislation. We believe the spirit of the enhancements is to increase public awareness and establish greater procedural consistency, all in support of much-needed consolidation of the common wealth, water and wastewater systems.\nWhile the business of providing these critical services can at times lead to enhancements in the way we do business, including in the regulatory construct, we have no doubt about the overwhelmingly positive support we received from stakeholders as we pursue our company's mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about rate base growth, our regulatory plan and some recent news around lead service lines. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to Slide 9 where these graphs illustrate that our continued successful execution of our capital investment plan is succeeding in growing regulated rate base consistent with our long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states, beginning with our most recently filed cases. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in November and are seeking recovery of $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including testimony and evidentiary hearings that are scheduled for February and March. With rates still expected to be effective in August. As a reminder, Pennsylvania uses a forward test year for ratemaking purposes. In New Jersey, we filed a general rate case in January and are seeking recovery of over $1.3 billion of investments through December 2024. This case includes, for example, infrastructure improvement projects at all 7 of our surface water treatment plants in the state.\nWe expect the New Jersey case to be completed sometime later this fall. We also filed a general rate case last month in Illinois, where we have invested over $550 million since our last case. Our general rate cases in California, West Virginia and Virginia, are all progressing well and as expected. In California, we reached a partial settlement in the case in November related to the revenue request. We will prepare to implement the new rates retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon receiving the CPUC's decision on the settlement agreement and outstanding topics related to rate design and revenue stabilization mechanisms.\nOur request for a 1-year extension on the cost of capital was also granted, pushing the next filing out to May of 2025. In Indiana, we received a final order just yesterday, and it looks very constructive. We are currently evaluating it, and we'll share key takeaways in the next day or two, but overall, we're generally pleased. And finally, in Kentucky, we expect to receive a final order very soon.\nAs a reminder, we expect to file general rate cases about every 2 years in our larger jurisdictions. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes again in 2024 as we did in 2023. On the legislative front, in New Jersey, new legislation supporting capital investment was passed and was signed by the governor in January. The resiliency and environmental system investment charge or RFIC, for short, establishes a new regulatory mechanism that will enable water and wastewater utilities to recover in a more timely manner, capital spending related to investments in resiliency, environmental compliance, safety and public health. This includes capital related to PFAS remediation.\nIn fact, most of our states where PFAS is present. There are either existing environmental mechanisms that we believe PFAS investments will fit under or we're proactively advocating for such mechanisms. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 11 that we have $390 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January of 2023. This includes $273 million from general rate cases and step increases and $117 million from infrastructure surcharges. We also have $670 million of total annualized revenue request pending. As a reminder, American Water recovers about 75% of our overall capital spend through infrastructure mechanisms or forward test years, which greatly reduces regulatory lag.\nAlongside all of the investments we're making, we remain extremely focused on customer affordability and operating efficiently. We are continuing to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We are also continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and cost management to deliver on customer affordability, especially as the regulatory demand such as the proposed PFAS rule and lead and copper rule improvements drive increases in -- on our capital program.\nOn Slide 12, I'd like to cover our recent announcements regarding the U.S. EPA's proposed lead and copper rule improvements. Like PFAS we think clear rules are important and should be enforced for all providers. American Water consistently meets water quality standards related to the lead and copper rules across our footprint and believes removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. But also like PFAS, we believe all stakeholders must understand the costs associated with the proposed improvements to the lead and copper rule and that the EPA estimates are likely understated.\nThe cost to identify the material of all unknown service lines and replace all lead service lines, including the customer owned lines and galvanized lines were needed by 2037, will require significant investment for all water systems. We are currently developing preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. Unlike PFAS though, the expected time line for complying with the lead and copper rule improvements is much longer, so the impact on capital spend will be more gradual. Providing safe, reliable and affordable water is American Water's business.\nWe continue to work with the EPA, Congress, regulators and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, community and the general public. As I close on Slide 13, you can see that our 5-year capital plan, which is unchanged from November, has $1 billion for PFAS and approximately $500 million for lead service line replacements. We have been proactively investing about $100 million per year to replace lead service lines for several years now and expect to continue that level at least through 2030 or beyond.\nDepending on the EPA's requirements in the final lead and copper rule improvements such as for customer-owned service lines, our annual investment level may need to be revised and likely over a longer period of time. Also, we are still awaiting a final rule from the U.S. EPA on PFAS. We continue to expect that there will be no material changes to the proposed rule, and we have not changed any of our announced plans or estimates last November related to PFAS compliance. We continue to treat for PFAS in compliance with state regulations and we continue to prepare for full compliance with the new federal rule once released.\nPreviously, we have disclosed that we are a party to the multi-district litigation, or MDL lawsuit and U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against manufacturers of certain PFAS like 3M and DuPont for damages. In early December, there were deadlines to decide whether or not to remain partly to the 2 potential settlements with manufacturers, and we did remain a party to both settlements. We believe this is the optimal path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in expedient manner for our [indiscernible]. On February 8, the MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont settlement. We will now begin the process of perfecting our claims under this settlement within the time period provided by the MDL.\nA fairness hearing on the 3M settlement was held on February 2. This matter remains pending. In closing, it's important for investors to understand that the ever-changing regulatory environment is leading to significant industry challenges, including those related to lead and PFAS, but also with issues like cybersecurity, for example. Each change on its own is significant, but the layering effect of all these changes is even more dramatic. The expertise we bring to the table to solve these challenges is well recognized across the states where we operate and sets us apart from others.\nIt's a privilege and a great responsibility to deliver safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to our customers and communities. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 15. Let me provide a few more details on financial results for 2023. The appendix also has details of fourth quarter EPS. Consolidated earnings were $4.90 per share in 2023, up $0.39 per share compared to 2022 and up $0.32 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our systems.\nAs noted, earnings were higher in 2023 by an estimated net $0.13 per share as a result of weather in the second, third and fourth quarters due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related to [indiscernible] warm and dry conditions in New Jersey.\nAnd looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.13 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.11 per share, including inflationary pressures are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively [indiscernible] in general rate cases we completed in the last 12 to 18 months. In the fourth quarter, we also had higher costs of about $0.10 per share related to waste disposal, equipment repairs, tank painting and other maintenance costs across our footprint.\nSupporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.24 per share and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.38 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I have mentioned all year, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance back in early March was offset by avoided interest on the year. An additional benefit realized this year from the equity issuance is the interest income we have been earning from the cash balance held since March. Other reflects primarily post-closing acquisition adjustments in 2022 from the sales of HOS in New York, which added to EPS.\nTurning to Slide 16. You'll see that we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on 23 acquisitions totaling $77 million across 8 states in 2023. We also have 25 transactions under agreement across 7 states at year-end, totaling $589 million and 88,000 customer connections. This total includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois. We are very close to completing the Granite City acquisition, where we already provide wastewater collection service for approximately 12,000 customers.\nIn Pennsylvania, as Susan briefly discussed, the regulatory environment relating to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive, but will take a period of time to sort out. We are very confident that AXS-12 fair market value legislation will remain in place and continue to have strong support. As is often the case, implementation of legislation needs to be worked through in the regulatory arena, and that is what is happening now. In the meantime, closing of our current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual. But to be clear, we are confident that the previously approved Butler acquisition will close soon.\nWe are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania, driven by the continued need for system consolidation and upgrading for the benefit of communities in Pennsylvania who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service. As you know, we have a strong track record of closing acquisitions. Over the past 5 years, we've closed over 100 acquisitions across 12 states, totaling nearly 200,000 new customer connections. Of course, as we close transactions, the work to build and refill our acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of more than 1.3 million customer connections with meaningful contributions from across our platform continues to be a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate base growth outlook.\nAs you recall, in November, we introduced our long-term target of 2% annual customer growth from acquisitions as shown on Slide 7. This equates to about 70,000 acquired customers per year based on our current customer count of approximately 3.5 million customers. We are proactively investing in our capabilities across our platform to bolster our system-wide contribution to acquisitions to support this growth and are confident in meeting our 2% long-term target.\nTurning to Slide 17. Here, we show the buildup from 2023 weather-normalized actual to the 2024 EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 that we introduced last November, which reflects 8% growth at the midpoint of $5.15. Working from that same buildup yesterday, we announced an increase of $0.10 per share to our 2024 EPS guidance range, which is now $5.20 to $5.30 per share. The increase is due solely to additional interest income we will receive in 2024 and expect to receive annually through 2026 from the amended terms of the secured seller note from the sale of HOS.\nAs we described in the 8-K we filed on February 5, the note balance has been increased to $795 million from $720 million which satisfies payment of the contingent consideration owed to American Water of $75 million triggered by the extension of HOS service agreement with the New York City water board. In addition, reflecting current market interest rates and removal of American Water's option to require prepayment of the note at a future date, the annual interest rate on the note has been increased from 7% to 10%.\nAmerican Water is pleased to see the continued growth of the HOS business under its new ownership, including the service contract extension with New York City as well as the significant acquisition recently announced by HOS, which will be funded with new equity from HOS' owners. As it relates to future earnings guidance, it will be important for investors to be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy before this additional interest income. Therefore, when we provide forward year EPS guidance each November, we will be sure to note the EPS associated with the additional interest income from the secured seller note in that guidance.\nTo wrap up, Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition, which we further solidified in 2023. Just last month, Moody's affirmed our solid BAA1 investment-grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio. We are confident our FFO to debt ratios will continue to support our current credit ratings. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, net of our roughly $330 million of cash on hand is 55%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%.\nWhile having moderated somewhat, the current higher interest rate environment continues to be challenging. As I said in November, though, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with this challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the best of our customers and shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI would now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nLet me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.\nAdditional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the third quarter earnings release and in our September 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share.\nSusan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of third quarter and year-to-date results, and we'll comment on our 2024 EPS guidance and longer-term targets. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our new capital investment plan including the expected impact of PFAS related investments and will conclude with a regulatory update, including our views on customer affordability.\nJohn Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will then discuss our year-to-date financial results in more detail, discuss our acquisition outlook and we'll close with details behind our 2024 outlook and longer-term goals and our 2024 to 2028 financing plan. After a few final remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights from the third quarter and year-to-date periods. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2023, and we're pleased to again reaffirm our 2023 guidance on a weather-normalized basis.\nEarnings were $1.66 per share for the quarter compared to $1.63 for the same period last year. In the first 9 months of 2023, earnings were $4.03 per share compared to $3.70 per share in the same period of '22. The estimated net favorable weather impact year-to-date in '23 is about $0.11 per share compared to $0.06 per share favorable in '22. These weather normalized results so far in 2023 continue to reflect our strong execution in line with our growth expectations for the year. John will elaborate further on results later.\nMoving on to some of our other key accomplishments to date in 2023. We have invested $1.8 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. As you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2023 includes approximately $400 million of acquisitions including 1 sizable transaction in Pennsylvania, we expect to close in December and another in Illinois around the end of the year.\nAs you know, we completed an equity issuance of $1.7 billion in March and a $1 billion convertible debt issuance in June. These were the 2 key priorities of our 2023 financing plan. We were focused on completing these issuances in the first half of the year to reduce market-related pricing risk and overall execution risk, which has served our investors, customers and our customers well considering the current market conditions.\nTurning to Slide 6. As we roll out our new 5-year plan today, we are affirming our long-term targets, including 7% to 9% EPS and dividend compounded annual growth rates. We are also initiating our 2024 earnings guidance of $5.10 per share to $5.20 per share, which John will discuss further later in the discussion. This represents our expectation of 8% EPS growth in 2024 compared to our weather-normalized 2023 EPS guidance.\nOne thing to note on this slide is that we have revised the look of our earnings growth outlook. Recall that we had historically referred to it as our growth triangle. We believe this new version better highlights our compelling 7% to 9% earnings growth expectation and better represents the key drivers of growth. As a nearly 100% regulated water and waste water utility rate base growth and regulatory execution are the key drivers of growth for our company. Rate base growth continues to be driven by the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth 2 years ago and now with this updated plan. Combined with our robust regulated acquisition strategy on which we've proven we can execute, we continue to expect 8% to 9% rate base growth over the next decade.\nLater, Cheryl will review the amount of capital we expect to spend over the next 5 years, including related to acquisitions. On this slide, you can see we are highlighting our acquisition growth strategy measured by a compounded annual growth rate in customer connections of 2%. The timing of closing on acquisitions is often difficult to control within a calendar year, which can cause volatility and acquisition investment on a year-to-year basis. This 2% customer additions CAGR target should be an easier way for investors to monitor and measure our growth through acquisitions.\nAnd as I said, rate base growth, which includes acquisition investment is the key driver to earnings growth. Our growth outlook also includes the organic revenue growth opportunities we expect from our Military Services Group from the 18 installations we currently serve with an added upside for any new bases secured.\nOne of our company's competitive advantages is its diverse regulated operations across 14 states that provides us with flexibility in the timing of rate cases and capital deployment. We also have a very predictable and controllable set of capital projects annually, almost half of which are recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms. Along with our other regulatory approaches, we are confident, we can deliver consistent earnings growth and dividend growth over the next 5 years and beyond. While utility stocks, including ours, have seen the impact on the short term of higher interest rates, history has shown that over medium and longer-term horizons, the utility sector and certainly American Water has delivered compelling value to investors. We believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth, supported by our significant yet low-risk capital investment plan and our focus on customer affordability and ESG leadership will continue to be rewarded by investors. Based on this long-term plan and our history of executing on our strategies, we intend to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment plan and our focus on customer affordability and regulatory execution. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into a discussion of our current long-term capital plan, starting on Slide 8, I want to first acknowledge that our teams have done a great job executing on our accelerated capital investment plans these last few years. We have consistently met our capital deployment goal, and we're on pace to do it again by meeting our overall capital plan of $2.9 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect a modest increase in our investment spending level to roughly $3.1 billion. Over the next 5 years, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion to $17 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over our previous plan. This level of spending reflects the result of our consistent risk-based project planning. Along with risk, customer affordability is a key variable in our analysis, which I'll speak more about shortly.\nLooking out over the next decade, we expect to invest $34 billion to $38 billion in our regulated systems and acquisitions, which is $4 billion higher than the previous 10-year plan. In addition to tackling PFAS, we expect the follow-on capital needs related to acquisitions to continue to increase over time and modestly higher costs for pipe and other capital goods over time.\nContinuing on Slide 9. The increase in the 5-year capital plan is primarily driven by 3 needs. First, the plan includes approximately $1 billion of needed investment to treat water for PFAS contamination across our systems. As we've said many times, American Water supports the USEPA's efforts to protect public health by proposing national drinking water standards for PFAS. And we believe our company is in a better position than any water utility to remove PFAS at the level that would be required under the rule as proposed. And we've also said the cost to comply will be significant.\nRoughly $1 billion of capital remains our best estimate based upon the proposed federal EPA rule, which we expect will be finalized in late 2023 or early 2024 without much modification. We expect most of these PFAS related capital investments to occur over a 3-year period beginning later in 2024 and primarily in our larger states in terms of customers served, like New Jersey as an example. The source water supplies for New Jersey American Water that have PFAS contamination include large surface water supplies that are more costly to treat than our groundwater sources. And as we've said, granulated granular activated carbon or GIC will be the primary treatment method we use for PFAS remediation because it's a proven and more cost-effective treatment option for our systems.\nHowever, we're also piloting ion exchange resins along GAC to compare PFAS removal and media performance, which impacts the overall cost of treatment. While much uncertainty exists around the topic of PFAS, including the recovery of related capital and operating costs, we expect constructive outcomes for this important water quality initiative, and we will continue to advocate that the ultimate responsibility for the cleanup of these contaminants should fall to the polluters. We'll also continue to advocate that all water and wastewater utility providers regardless of ownership, have equal access to any federal and/or state funding related to treating PFAS.\nIn addition, we'll continue our efforts to request permanent federal funding for our water and wastewater low-income customer assistance program. The other 2 drivers of increased CapEx in the 2024 to 2028 plan are a higher level of spend related to prioritized renewal projects across our footprint, such as for hydrant, pipe and meter replacement as well as a higher level of expected follow-on capital related to future acquisitions. Following recent acquisitions, we have continued to experience a higher level of investment need in order to bring water and wastewater systems into regulatory compliance and up to our operating standards, which is driving the higher estimated capital need of $600 million.\nYou can also see that we have deferred $500 million of lower risk projects to later years beyond the 5-year plan. We did this as a part of our extensive risk-based project analysis in conjunction with our ongoing affordability analysis. For example, we deferred until later in the 10-year capital plan, the replacement of some services and mains where it was determined that they did not pose an immediate risk to service reliability or water quality.\nLet's turn to Slide 10, and I'll cover the latest regulatory activity across our states. Shown in this slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. Our general rate cases in California, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky are all progressing well and as expected. All of these cases, except perhaps California, will most likely be resolved in early 2024.\nJust yesterday, we filed a general rate case in Virginia, reflecting $110 million in system investments covering May 2023 through April 2025. We're seeking $20 million of additional annual revenue and expect interim rates to go into effect in May of next year. Outside of our general rate cases, as we discussed last quarter, we filed a request as authorized by California's water cost of capital mechanism seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, or increasing the return on equity to 9.5% effective July 31.\nWe filed a similar request in October for an additional 70 basis point increase to go into effect January 1, 2024, which would bring our ROE to 10.2% and finally, related to the customers we have proudly served in the Monterrey community for over 100 years. In October, a local entity adopted a resolution, enabling it to file an imminent domain lawsuit with respect to the Monterrey system assets. This is not a new issue, just the latest chapter in a long-running effort by an entity that we believe lacks the expertise to own and operate a very complex water distribution system serving these Monterrey customers.\nBottom line, we believe based upon existing legal precedent will be able to successfully defend against an imminent domain lawsuit, if it's filed. You can find more information on this topic in our SEC filings, including this quarter's 10-Q.\nMoving to Slide 11. I'll wrap up with a discussion of customer affordability and this new capital investment plan. Using U.S. Census Bureau data specific to the geographies we serve, our research and analysis concluded that projected rising levels of median household income combined with conservative assumptions around an increasing customer base would allow us to stay within our target for residential water bills of 1% or less of median household income.\nOne of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, today, our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share.\nAt the same time, we realize we must continue to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We must also continue our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and cost management in order to deliver on customer affordability.\nOur dual focus on operating efficiency and customer affordability has been a valuable part of our company's DNA for many years. As you know, we've historically used O&M efficiency as 1 of our benchmark metrics to measure our success at managing costs as we grow the business. In recent years, we've emphasized that revenue growth has been just as impactful to the O&M efficiency metric as managing costs.\nAs we look ahead, we're continuing to evaluate whether this is the best metric by which to judge our effectiveness at managing costs and running an efficient business. More to come on this in 2024.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide a few more details on year-to-date results. The appendix also has details of third quarter EPS, which has many of the same drivers as year-to-date results.\nConsolidated earnings were $4.03 per share year-to-date, up $0.33 per share compared to the same period in 2022 and up $0.28 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states.\nThese additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher year-to-date by an estimated net $0.11 per share as a result of weather in the second and third quarters due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related mostly to warm and dry conditions in New Jersey.\nIn looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.10 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.09 per share, including inflationary pressures are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought through the use of forward test years and traditional updates to base cost of service and general rate cases we completed in the last 12 to 18 months.\nThis strategy has limited the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023 and is a strategy we are continuing to use in our recently filed and upcoming cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.17 per share and the cost of additional long-term financing increased to $0.28 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided interest expense in the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well based on the current outlook.\nTurning to Slide 14. This graph illustrates that our continued execution on capital investments both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding and growing regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis.\nTurning to Slide 15, you'll see that we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on 14 acquisitions totaling $36 million across 6 states in the first 9 months of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states. We also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of September totaling $611 million, 2 of which we closed in early October, including 1 in West Virginia for $27 million.\nThis total also includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania, and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois, we previously announced. We expect the Butler acquisition to close later this year in Granite City around year-end, pending regulatory approvals for each and we look forward to serving those customers. Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the [ Talman ] on Township wastewater system in Pennsylvania, we expect to purchase for $104 million as announced back in March. We expect to close this acquisition in late 2024 or early 2025, pending final regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving those customers as well.\nOur outlook for future acquisitions remains very strong. as we expect to have over $250 million of acquisitions under agreement at the end of 2023 after the expected closings of Butler and Granite City. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate base growth outlook.\nOn Slide 16, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2024 results in our newly established EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by capital investment to serve our customers and earning a return on that investment. As we've talked about previously, 2023 is year 2 of our accelerated CapEx plan following the HOS sale, so we see that ramp-up reflected in earnings in 2024, both from base rate increases and infrastructure mechanisms.\nAs a reminder, approximately 45% of our CapEx is recoverable by infrastructure mechanisms, so it's a very meaningful driver of consistent earnings growth for us. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year.\nI'd like to note that our Military Services Group does add incrementally to our earnings growth expectation as we have continued to show in our growth outlook. MSG's great work on the 18 military installations it serves has built trust and resulted in the U.S. government allocating additional funds for improvement projects driving increased revenues. Just as critical to our growth strategy is our ability to prudently manage the operating costs it takes to run the business, which goes to my final point on this slide.\nBecause of our strong culture of operating efficiency and cost management, we expect only modest increases in O&M in 2024. These efforts go to the heart of the customer affordability construct we want to protect which is closely aligned with the interests of regulators and ultimately, investors in managing affordability of customer bills.\nFinally, related to pension, I'd simply remind you that our pension obligation remeasurement will be done at year-end 2023 and that will drive the determination of our 2024 pension expense.\nTurning to Slide 17. I'll provide a financing plan update before closing with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile. In our prior 5-year plan through 2027, we expected a total of $2 billion of equity financing need. We successfully issued $1.7 billion of the $2 billion earlier this year, leaving $300 million of equity financing needed towards the end of that prior plan. Based on our new capital plan, our financing plan now includes an estimated $1 billion of equity issuances from 2024 through 2028. The $1 billion of equity in our new plan is expected to be issued near the middle of the 2024 to 2028 period subject to market conditions.\nThe $700 million increase in the anticipated external equity need is driven by the incremental $2 billion of CapEx in the new plan. As we've said many times now, we expect incremental CapEx to be funded roughly 50-50 debt and equity, which includes both external equity and cash flow from operations. Our financing plan design also takes into account the goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing to meet our long-term debt to capital target of less than 60%.\nAnother assumption inherent in our new plan is that we will continue to be a cash taxpayer, especially as we will likely become subject to the new corporate alternative minimum tax in the coming years.\nOn Slide 18, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30 net of the roughly $630 million of cash on hand remains at 54%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. As we are all aware, the current higher interest rate environment is challenging.\nWe are, however, in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances. We remain confident that we will have strong access to capital for the long term. In fact, we just extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to October 2028, which has a capacity of $2.75 billion.\nOur diversified banking relationships with some of the largest and strongest banks in the world, coupled with our fully regulated business model and strong credit ratings gives us great confidence around liquidity. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is very important in environments like the current 1 to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk, which contributes to managing customer affordability. And our short duration between general rate cases allows us to minimize any lag we may experience related to recovery of debt costs.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Susan for some closing thoughts. Susan?\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, John. To close on Slide 20, you've heard our latest strategic thinking today, and it should sound very familiar. It's all about execution at every level. As we continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently execute, we believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth, combined with our focus on affordability and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors.\nWe believe these aspects of our business and strategies separate us from all utilities. They are underpinned by our significant low-risk capital investment plan, which includes our best-in-class execution on acquisitions and our excellent regulatory execution. All while maintaining a strong balance sheet with a well-planned debt maturity profile and a differentiated affordability proposition. Through our consistent achievement of high operating standards, including our leading safety culture and water quality accolades, our team at American Water has raised the bar for success in the water and wastewater industry. And that includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group team to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint.\nOur history of executing on our strategies has delivered a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return. With this long-term plan, we have full confidence in our ability to achieve the goals we talked about today and continue our track record of delivering superior shareholder value.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Chris to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast within the accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI will now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sasha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.\nAdditional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the second quarter earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share.\nSusan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of second quarter and year-to-date results and thoughts on our affirmed 2023 EPS guidance and longer-term targets. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our successful financing activities in the first half of the year, cover our financial results in more detail, and we'll close with an update on our acquisition activity.\nCheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan, regulatory updates and will conclude with a review of our recently published sustainability report and other new disclosures. We'll then close by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and the first half of 2023. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter compared to $1.20 for the same period last year.\nIn the first 6 months of 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the same period of 2022. The results were in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong compared to last year due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in '22, and in early '23 and from infrastructure mechanism filings.\nWe continue to execute on our regulatory strategy, which continues to be the key driver of our results. Revenues in the second quarter were also higher due to increased usage from warm and unusually dry weather in several of our states. Tempering results were higher operating costs, which John will elaborate on further.\nMoving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023. We invested nearly $1.2 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. Also, as you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2023 includes approximately $400 million for acquisitions, including 2 sizable transactions we expect to close in the fourth quarter.\nOur outlook for future acquisitions remains strong as we have over $550 million of acquisitions under agreement, including those 2 sizable deals. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan.\nAnd as we announced last month, we completed a convertible debt issuance of just over $1 billion that achieved the other key element of our 2023 financing plan. Finally, earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report. Cheryl will share a few highlights of the report, but at its core, it tells the story of how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable way to American Water customers.\nAnd this has been our mission for over 135 years. Turning to Slide 6. We are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 per share to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. And once again, we are affirming our long-term targets. I continue to believe that our regulatory -- our strong regulatory financing and operational execution is the differentiator from our peers. Our track record of executing on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently grow earnings and dividends at a top-tier pace over the next 5 years and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover some second quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I'll start by reviewing the successful completion of our 2023 financing plan. As Susan mentioned, and as I covered on the last call, earlier this year, we completed an upsized equity offering for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity is expected to be issued near the end of this 5-year plan, as we've previously communicated.\nThen last month, we issued just over $1 billion of exchangeable senior notes due in 2026 with an annual interest rate of 3.625%. As we previously disclosed, this exchangeable debt issuance supports our long-term growth as a diversified low-cost funding source that benefits customer affordability and shareholder value.\nUpon any exchange of the notes, the principal amount will be settled in cash with flexibility to settle any remaining value above the principal amount in cash, shares or a combination thereof at our election. We used the proceeds from both of these transactions to bring our commercial paper balance to zero by quarter end with almost $800 million of cash yet to be utilized, that is earning interest.\nWith our 2023 long-term financing needs now complete, our balance sheet is well positioned to fund our robust water and wastewater investment growth. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition, our total debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash on the balance sheet remains at 54% as of June 30, which is well below our target of 60%. We believe our current debt maturity levels in conjunction with future debt needs are very manageable.\nAnd I would remind you, as shown on this slide, of the $720 million of no proceeds that we will receive in 2026 from the sale of HOS completed in 2021. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk.\nAnd finally, on liquidity, we remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide 10. I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter of $0.24 per share versus the same period in 2022, and up $0.17 per share on a weather-normalized basis.\nAs you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in the quarter by an estimated $0.07 per share due to weather in 2023 due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nBut we did see unusual weather in the quarter resulting in higher throughput, which we typically don't see during this time of year, our investments in resiliency and our proactive communications to customers around water conservation, ensured that we did not experience any significant operating issues during the quarter. And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.04 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.03 per share, including inflationary pressures were largely mitigated by the higher revenues.\nBased on the current outlook, we are not expecting the cost of chemicals to decrease in the near term as demand remains elevated. Our operating costs in the second quarter also increased due to a higher employee headcount to support growth in the business. As we've said, our proactive strategy last year to seek [ rate ] of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023.\nThis approach continues in our recently filed cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.06 per share and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.11 per share primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided expense and the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well based on the current outlook.\nTurning to Slide 11. Earnings increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.23 per share year-to-date, which, as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year.\nBefore we look at our expected full year 2023 EPS details, I should note that, as you would expect in the year of an equity issuance, our quarterly EPS results may not sum to equal the year-to-date EPS results each quarter. This is simply due to a different amount of average shares outstanding used in the EPS calculations as the year progresses.\nTurning to Slide 12. I'll echo Susan's comments that our results remain on track to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Here, we provide some updated details related to 2023 guidance that reflect results so far this year, including the completed 2023 financing plan. You can see, for example, that our implied revenue growth for the second half of the year will be strong, though somewhat less than the first half growth as new rates became effective in New Jersey last September.\nLooking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place, including our strengthened balance sheet to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. Turning to Slide 13, you'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We closed on 10 acquisitions totaling $33 million across 5 states in the first half of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states.\nWe also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of June totaling $555 million and includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania, and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois we previously announced. We now expect to close both of these transactions near the end of 2023 pending regulatory approvals for each. Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we expect to purchase for $104 million as announced back in March. We continue to expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, pending regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving all of these customers.\nOf course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. With our track record of closing on acquisitions and executing on our CapEx plans, we are confident that we will achieve our capital investment plan of $2.9 billion for 2023. And when you combine that with the financing we have already completed to fund growth, we believe our outlook for 2023 and beyond is very attractive for investors.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by commenting on our continued focus on investing in our systems. Slide 15 shows a recap of our capital investment so far in 2023. As John said, we remain on plan to meet our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of total capital spending for the full year.\nOur state teams continue to execute each quarter on the multitude of projects that improve our systems. Two examples of the types of projects we're working on are improvements to the lime softening system, chemical facilities and filters at the Jerseyville, Illinois [indiscernible] treatment plan and enhanced variation capabilities and other digester improvements at the Coatesville water treatment plant in Pennsylvania.\nThese renewal and improvement projects are typical examples of how the capital we deploy is essential to our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable drinking water and wastewater services. And finally, as John mentioned, our larger acquisitions in 2023 are expected to occur in the second half of the year as compared to 2022, when the first half of the year included our largest acquisition for the year, over $200 million for the City of York's wastewater system.\nLet's go to Slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states.\nSharing with our -- starting with our general rate cases in California and Indiana, both are progressing as expected. In Indiana, hearings are expected in early fall, which follows testimony filed by all parties in July and August. In California, we expect hearings in the fall as well. At the beginning of May, we filed a general rate case in West Virginia, reflecting $340 million in water and wastewater system investments covering 2020 through 2025.\nWe are seeking $45 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges, we would expect an order in February of next year. At the end of June, we filed a general rate case in Kentucky reflecting $330 million in water system investments since the last rate case order in 2019. We are seeking $26 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges to support continued safe and reliable service and recovery of increased production costs.\nWe would expect an order in this case in February of next year. In Missouri, we were pleased to receive a final decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission in May. The negotiated settlement reflects the increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges.\nThough not specifically noted in the order, our view of the return on equity allowed is 9.75%, and the equity ratio is 50%. Outside of general rate cases, the California Commission issued a decision on June 29 on California American Water's 2021 cost of capital application authorizing an 8.98% ROE with an equity component of 57.04%. The decision was not retroactive and will be effective through the end of 2024.\nThe following day, we filed an advice letter as authorized by the state's water cost of capital mechanism seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, increasing the return on equity to 9.50% effective July 31. As Susan mentioned, our regulatory execution is a key driver of our results and our team continues to do an excellent job. As we previously discussed, we submitted written comments on the federal EPA's proposed PFOS rule in May.\nThe key concern that we voiced is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our internal and preliminary estimates show that capital investments in excess of $1 billion will be needed by American Water, along with nearly $50 million of annual operating expenses in order to comply with the rule as currently proposed. We are still evaluating the potential impact of our 5-year capital plan, including whether PFOS will drive incremental CapEx in the plan or if some currently planned projects will be completed later beyond the 5-year horizon or both.\nWe expect to have more to share on that in the third quarter earnings call. Related to ongoing PFOS litigation and the announcement of some settlements with manufacturers of PFOS, we are a long way from knowing what these settlements mean for our customers, including if, how and when funds from these settlements or other litigation may ultimately be distributed. We will continue to advocate that the ultimate responsibility for the cleanup of these contaminants should fall to the polluters, and we will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities balanced with affordability.\nAnother topic that's been in the news recently is around certain telecommunication companies and their historical usage of lead insulated cables. While these stories don't relate to American Water, we'd remind you to review the disclosures we've had for many years in our Form 10-K around the replacement of lead service lines in our regulated service territories. We are in great shape related to that replacement program.\nFinally, on Slide 17, earlier this week, we released our latest sustainability report covering the years 2021 and 2022. This report highlights our commitment to excellent water quality, customer affordability and continued investing in water and wastewater infrastructure and our sustainable business practices and values that align with these commitments.\nTo demonstrate our ESG leadership and commitment to transparency, we also continue to expand and update disclosures related to how we operate the business, some of which we've referenced here. And we're pleased to continue to be recognized by leading ESG rating services such as MSCI for our actions and our disclosures in this space.\nOne final comment before I wrap up. As you know, there have been several weather events this quarter, including the severe flooding in New York State. While we no longer have regulated utility operations there, we do operate the water system and 2 wastewater treatment plants at U.S. Military Academy West Point through our Military Services Group business. Our teams there went above and beyond to ensure West Point could continue to operate and have continued access to safe and reliable water and wastewater services, and we did so safely.\nOur teams across the entire business are experts at what they do every day. We thank them and are grateful for their commitment and expertise in delivering to those we serve and doing so in a safe and sustainable way. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

Susan Hardwick\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Water Works Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we're off to a good start in 2023 with strong financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter compared to $0.87 per share last year. The increased results were as expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we're pleased to affirm. .\nHere, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023. And John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful upsized equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. We also invested well over $500 million of capital in infrastructure in the quarter.\nIn addition, we secured 2 large acquisitions so far this year, which puts us at over $550 million of acquisitions under agreement. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service. The other significant news in the first quarter for us in the water industry as a whole came from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when they released proposed national standards for PFAS.\nWe support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges in the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability. We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the U.S. water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges.\nProviding safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service to customers has been American Water's mission for over 130 years. We will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities, balanced with affordability.\nCheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS proposal and our response to it, but I want to assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise and the will to tackle this issue head on and to advocate for reasonable policies and outcomes related to this very important topic.\nTurning to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share as well as our long-term targets. We believe our strong regulatory and operational execution is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long-term plan, growing earnings and dividends at a top-tier pace over the next 5 years and beyond.\nMoving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.655 per share to 0.7075 per share, an 8% increase. We have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9.7% over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target.\nOur Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to many of our investors.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to John to cover some first quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. I'll start by reviewing the equity issuance completed in March really the first primary offering of meaningful size for American Water since 2009. As we've said, our plan was to issue in 2023, a significant portion of the $2 billion of expected equity needed in our current 5-year plan that goes through 2027.\nWe were pleased to see very strong demand for the offering, which was upsized and the [ Greenshoe ] fully exercised for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity expected to be issued near the end of this 5-year plan. We used the proceeds to bring our commercial paper balance down to 0 by quarter end, with a modest amount of cash left over.\nWith the equity issuance, our balance sheet is fortified to fund our robust water and wastewater investment well into the future. Our total debt-to-capital ratio, which at year-end was just above our target of 60% or less, has decreased meaningfully to 54% as of quarter end. With our growth plan, this metric will rise somewhat over the next few years until we reset again as we receive in late 2026 the no proceeds from our sale of HOS and issue the remaining equity that is in our current 5-year plan.\nSo to wrap up on equity, we believe the execution of this issuance is another indicator that the American Water investment thesis is strong, led by our compelling growth story and the leadership role we play in the utility sector. I'd like to take a moment to thank our treasury, legal, IR and many other teams at American Water as well as our external advisers who worked diligently to prepare us to be ready to execute this transaction early in the year when the window of opportunity emerged.\nTurning our attention to Slide 10. I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2022. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we are making in our infrastructure, including the acceleration of spend made possible by the proceeds from the sales of New York American Water and Homeowner Services.\nAs we've said consistently since the sales, it takes time to reinvest the sales proceeds, and we are beginning to see those impacts. And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.03 per share and inflationary pressure on chemical, fuel and power costs of about $0.04 per share were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Our proactive strategy last year to seek rate case recovery in many of our large jurisdictions of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023.\nAs with the rate case we just filed in Indiana, we will be looking to recover higher operating costs in other jurisdictions over the next year through earning a full return -- though earning a full return on rate base investments and acquisitions continues to be the key driver of our general rate cases.\nNext, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and interest on additional long-term debt increased $0.04 per share due to the $800 million senior note issuance from last May, both supporting our investment growth. Interest expense in the quarter also reflected about $0.04 per share from higher short-term interest rates.\nI would also note that the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance was essentially neutral to EPS when considering the avoided interest cost in the first quarter by paying off commercial paper. We expect dilution from the higher share count net of avoided interest expense to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well.\nFinally, other net consists primarily of favorable post-close adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2022 from the sale of HOS and additional earnings in 2023 from our new Military Services Group contract with Naval Station Mayport in Florida that we were awarded last summer.\nTurning to Slide 11. You'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We had 27 transactions under agreement across 9 states through the end of March, including the Butler Area Sewer Authority, Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we previously announced as well as the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we are purchasing for $104 million as announced in March as part of an agreement to assume that asset purchase agreement from NextEra.\nThen just a few weeks ago, we were pleased to announce the purchase of the wastewater treatment plant in Granite City, Illinois for $83 million, which puts us at over $550 million of acquisitions under contract. We hope to close on Granite City by the end of 2023 and expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, both pending regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving those customers.\nOf course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle.\nBefore I turn it over to Cheryl, I'll echo Susan's comment that we're off to a very good start to the year. I'm confident in our ability to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share.\nLooking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place including our newly strengthened balance sheet to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nSenior VP of Eastern Division & Chief Environmental Officer, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter, executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year.\nThis result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of capital investment spending in 2023. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts and timely recovery of these investments, you can see on Slide 14 that we already have $279 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January of 2023. This includes $229 million from general rate cases and step increases and $50 million from infrastructure surcharges. We also have $144 million of total annualized revenue request pending, including 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings.\nMoving on to our regulatory strategy on Slide 15. Our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. We have consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure and achieve timely recovery.\nWhen we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out bill increases to our customers, making those bills more manageable. The pie chart on the right side of the page also speaks to timely recovery of our investments across our footprint. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases.\nThis enables us not only to earn our lab return but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 75% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.\nThe ability to execute our regulatory strategies is a critical success factor for continuing to grow our business each year. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive, regulatory and legislative outcomes to help us work through those challenges.\nLet's go to Slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate cases in our top 10 states.\nAt the end of March, we filed a general rate case in Indiana, reflecting $875 million in water and wastewater system investments to be made through 2025 to continue providing safe and reliable service. The revenue request also includes an increase in the cost of chemicals and other operating costs that we continue to see. We are seeking to increase revenues over a phased 3-step process through May 2025 that would result in $87 million of additional annual revenue when fully implemented.\nIn California, our case was filed in July of last year and is progressing as expected so far. We're seeking increased revenues of approximately $95 million over a phased 3-step process with rate changes expected to be effective in 2024, 2025 and 2026. We're also still awaiting a ruling from the commission on the pending cost of capital case.\nIn Missouri, on March 3, we were pleased to file a settlement agreement with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The settlement reflects an increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. A final decision on this matter is expected in the second quarter of 2023.\nAnd finally, earlier this week, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the settlement of our rate request, authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $11 million. Outside of general rate cases, there were a few notable developments since our fourth quarter 2022 call. In California, related to the Monterey Water Supply Project we signed the Pure Water Monterey Expansion agreement following an order issued by the CPUC. We are now allowed to standard ratemaking treatment for the construction funding of the pumps and pipes that were built to support the expansion.\nTogether with the desalination and water reuse projects in process and Aqua for storage and recovery online, we believe that a secure water future for the Monterey Peninsula is now possible once the approval process is complete. On the legislative front, in Indiana, Senate Bill 180 passed the State House and Senate with bipartisan support and is awaiting the Governor's signature where it will become effective immediately.\nThis bill allows for consolidated rates in wastewater systems through Indiana's Service Enhancement Improvement Recovery Mechanism. Turning to PFAS, I'll expand on Susan's earlier comments on EPA's proposed rule making. While American Water has long been anticipating and preparing for the rule making, our initial analyses were primarily based on a federal PFAS standard that would be more in line with the higher treatment limits set by several states. We are carefully reviewing the EPA's proposed drinking water regulation to assess the 4 parts per trillion limits for PFOA and PFOS and the application of the hazard index approach for several other chemicals.\nOur review will assess impacts to our capital and operating expense plan as well as our needed financing. It's logical to assume that the significantly lower treatment level, the numbers -- the number of facilities that will require treatment will be larger as will the cost. One of our early concerns is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our analysis continues and upon completion of our preliminary assessment, we'll submit comments on the proposal to the EPA by May 30.\nAs the EPA develops its final rule, which is expected by the end of 2023, we'll have more information to share based upon further review and analysis. To be very clear though, American Water joins other water organizations in support of the EPA, Congress and other decision-makers in implementing reasonable policies aimed at keeping harmful PFAS out of drinking water supplies and communities.\nIn addition to the comments we intend to provide on the proposed rule itself. We also expect to provide comments to the EPA and others on many related issues, including the following: We'll ask for an exemption of water and wastewater systems from financial liability for PFAS under [ circa ]. We'll also ask to ensure all water and wastewater utility providers regardless of ownership, have equal access to any and all federal and/or state funding related to treating PFAS.\nIn addition, we'll request permanent federal funding for a water and wastewater low-income customer assistance program. Providing safe, reliable and affordable water is American Water's business. We'll continue to work productively with the EPA, Congress, regulators and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protects customers, communities and the general public.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you might have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website.\nThe audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Maureen Duffy, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Duffy, you may begin.\n\nMaureen Duffy\n\nSVP of Communications & External Affairs, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. I'm filling in today for Aaron, who is a bit under the weather. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nLet me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions.\nHowever, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.\nAdditional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the fourth quarter earnings release and in our 2022 Form 10-K, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nAnd finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will comment on our successful 2022 and our longer-term performance expectations and shareholder value.\nJohn Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our 2022 financial results in more detail, provide an update on acquisition activity and we'll close with a review of our outlook for 2023 and beyond, including financing plans.\nCheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan, rate base growth expectations and active general rate cases before concluding with some ESG recognition we recently received. We will then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Maureen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for join us today. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2022 with strong financial results that were just ahead of our plan.\nAs shown on Slide 5, earnings were $4.51 per share for the year, which included $0.06 per share of favorable weather we had previously discussed. Excluding weather, earnings of $4.45 per share were just above the midpoint of the guidance range we shared originally back in November of 2021.\nThink about what has occurred globally since November of 2021, including widespread inflation, interest rates on a significant climb upward, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and many people are returning to the office as the world began to stabilize following recurring waves of COVID outbreak.\nWhen I reflect on how much has changed in the world since November of 2021, I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we shared 1.5 years ago.\nI'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver and especially over the last few months during an active and better cold storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses and communities.\nYou can see here on Slide 5, a checklist of some of our key accomplishments in 2022, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors and analysts is that our strong execution in 2022, amid a challenging backdrop, coupled with our clear capital growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we can execute our plans in '23 and beyond and the great -- with the great momentum we have from 2022.\nTurning to Slide 6. As you can see, we have delivered an exceptional total shareholder return over the past 5 years, including a growing record of significant dividend increases. We're very proud of this history, which also compares favorably on a 3-year look back for TSR. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and water utility stocks in general did not perform as well in 2022 compared to the broader utility sector.\nValuations of high PE stocks fell rapidly in the first half of 2022 as actual and expected interest rate hikes changed the landscape of investment opportunities. As a result, the PE multiple gap that had greatly expanded between water utilities and electric and gas utilities in recent years narrowed in 2022. All of that, while we continued our very strong performance.\nThis chart shows clearly the impact of the macro environment we have been in and how it affected valuation without regard to specific performance. And as we've seen so far in 2023, this revaluing of the market has stabilized as many other macroeconomic drivers have stabilized, including interest rates.\nIf this continues to hold true, I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will drive shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for many years to come. Which takes us to Slide 7.\nThe comments that we'll share today are an affirmation of the financial plan, targets and guidance we laid out last November. Later, John will recap the drivers for growth in 2023, but big picture, we believe the combination of our EPS growth, our strong dividend, and ESG premium, and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from others in the utility sector.\nI'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2027 in our 5-year plan and beyond. This is primarily, of course, due to significant investments in infrastructure and regulated acquisitions.\nAnd as we get further into the plan, see the full effect on earnings from the increased capital spending and continue our track record of success in the regulatory arena, we will deliver on our earnings growth plan and within the target range. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover more detail on 2022 financial results, our '23 outlook and our financing plans. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. I'll start by providing more details on our financial results for the year. In 2022, earnings were $4.51 per share compared to $6.95 per share in 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 results included a gain of $2.70 per share from the sale of Homeowner Services and the $0.19 per share contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation from the proceeds of the sale.\nExcluding this net gain in 2021, earnings grew by $0.26 per share in 2022. Earnings on infrastructure investment were the key driver of the growth. In 2022, we saw an increase of $0.89 per share related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth.\nAlso, as discussed last quarter, weather was favorable by an estimated $0.06 per share in 2022 and $0.04 net year-over-year due primarily to warmer and drier conditions in 2022. Revenues in 2022 were favorable to plan for the year due to healthy organic demand and favorable and timely rate case execution in addition to the favorable weather.\nThese factors, combined with expense management and lower pension costs as compared to plan, helped offset the impacts of inflation we experienced in 2022. Specifically, O&M and other expense increased by $0.31 per share year-over-year with an estimated $0.23 of inflationary costs on chemicals, power and other fuel and higher interest rates.\nO&M and other also increased due to interest expense on new debt, state-level revenue taxes and insurance. Depreciation expense also increased $0.14 per share in support of growth in the regulated businesses.\nAnd as a reminder, 2021 results included $0.12 per share of operating earnings from our former New York subsidiary. The other operating segment results decreased in 2022 as the $0.31 per share of operating earnings from HOS in 2021 was mostly offset by $0.24 per share of earnings in 2022 from interest income and revenue share agreements.\nFinally, I want to note that we have a slide in the appendix that provides some additional details on fourth quarter results, which were also on plan. Turning to Slide 10. You'll see that in 2022, we had a strong year of business development growth as we closed on $335 million of acquisitions, which represents 70,000 customer connections across 7 states.\nI think it's worth pausing for a minute to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work it takes across our state teams in collaboration with our corporate team to develop these opportunities, execute purchase agreements and most importantly, close on such a sizable number of acquisitions.\nThe final statistics on any 1 calendar year's worth of acquisitions are often the result of many years of groundwork. We are confident we are the right choice for communities and search of solutions to their challenges, and we will continue to drive that vision. We are set up well for 2023 to be a strong year for growth through acquisitions.\nTo start the year, we had $326 million of signed purchase agreements across 9 states which includes the Butler Area Sewer Authority, Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we talked about last quarter. The integration work to add Butler's customers, operations and employees on to the American Water platform is progressing as planned.\nWe expect to close on that acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval and look forward to serving these new customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle.\nMoving to a discussion of our financial health. On Slide 11, we provide a summary of our strong financial condition as we head into 2023. As a sign of continued financial strength, both S&P and Moody's have recently affirmed our credit ratings of single A and Baa1, respectively, and with a stable outlook for both. We believe our debt maturity levels, along with our planned debt issuances are very manageable.\nOur laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to minimize interest rate risk in a rising rate environment. I expect us to continue to issue fixed-rate long-term debt to protect against interest rate volatility. For total debt to capital, which at year-end was just above our target of 60% or less, we expect a meaningful decrease in 2023 when we issue equity.\nAnd finally, on liquidity, we continue to remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future.\nMoving on to Slide 12. As Susan mentioned, we are affirming our earnings guidance for 2023 in the range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. With our record of execution, we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings expectations for 2023.\nThe factors behind our 2023 guidance and long-term outlook are consistent with our messaging when we initiated 2023 guidance in November of 2022. This year's growth builds on the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth in November of 2021, which is driven by capital investment to serve our customers.\nRecent acquisitions that are being incorporated into active rate cases or just completed rate cases will also drive revenue and earnings growth this year. The regulatory solutions we pursued in our recent cases and are pursuing in our active cases such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms are closely aligned with the interests of regulators and customers.\nThis approach helps to manage affordability and limit variability of customer bills, which ultimately aligns with our investors' interests as well. We are confident that we have in place regulatory solutions for over 75% of the elevated costs we anticipate in the near term, including certain production costs, interest and pension costs.\nAs it relates to pension costs, with our year-end pension obligation remeasurement completed, we now know the pension expense for 2023, and it is fully reflected in our unchanged 2023 EPS guidance range. Finally, 2023 results will benefit from MSG's successful addition of its first Navy contract that we announced last summer, which will be fully transitioned in March of this year.\nMoving on to our financing plan. We continue to expect to issue an estimated $2 billion of equity from 2023 through 2027. Consistent with our prior messaging, subject to market conditions, we plan to raise a significant portion of the total planned equity in 2023. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of planned equity not completed in 2023 is expected to be issued near the end of the current 5-year plan.\nAs we've said for several quarters now, we expect equity will be a regular financing tool to fund incremental growth in the investment plan and to maintain a strong balance sheet. We also continue to expect to raise capital annually in the debt markets, including later this year.\nOn Slide 13, we are affirming some more specifics regarding the key drivers for 2023 that I just discussed. These drivers are also generally consistent with what we shared last quarter, and demonstrate the importance of our ongoing regulatory execution.\nRecent new revenue in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois, together with infrastructure surcharge mechanisms account for a significant majority of the $1.10 to $1.20 per share revenue increase in 2023 shown on this slide. Also reflected are the financing plans we expect to execute in 2023 that I just reviewed.\nWrapping up on Slide 14, I'll echo Susan on how we drive our growth strategy and our operating plans to achieve our company's targets and goals. For the communities we already serve and the communities we hope to serve in the future, the capital investment needs that are required to deliver more sustainable water and wastewater services are very large. It's up to us to find ways to balance these investment needs with the affordability of services for our customers.\nAs you've heard today, we are affirming our long-term earnings and dividend growth targets and our other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. We believe our 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth targets are compelling and maintain our position in the top tier of growth in the industry.\nThe combination of our growth outlook, supported by our significant yet low-risk capital investment plan, as well as our ESG leadership premium and constructive position on affordability should continue to be rewarded by investors.\nBased upon this and our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our CapEx and rate base growth plan, rate case updates, and more on ESG. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nExecutive VP & COO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 16, I want to start by acknowledging that our entire company did an excellent job of safely executing on our accelerated capital plan and safely performing our day-to-day work in 2022.\nWhile we didn't reach our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, we did record our best year ever in terms of safety performance. That's quite an achievement since 2022 was also a record year of total investment in American Water, and we experienced some extreme weather conditions. We slightly exceeded our $2.5 billion goal for the year by making prudent investment decisions across our footprint and by acquiring many new systems, which John spoke about earlier.\nLooking ahead to 2023, and as we told you in November, we increased our investment plan this time to $2.9 billion overall and roughly $2.5 billion for capital expenditures. This will likely be our new annual threshold for the next few years. Coupled with detailed project plans, we expect this pace of investment to drive improvements in water quality and reliability for the benefit of our customers.\nThese investments also generate significant economic benefit to the local and regional economies while improving the environmental compliance of the systems in these communities. These investments should also favorably impact our pipe replacement cycles, which are much better than the industry average. Taken together, these actions demonstrate how the values of ESG are integrated into our everyday work.\nTurning to Slide 17. I won't spend much time here, but this graph simply illustrates the result of our continued execution on capital investments. The combination of infrastructure projects and acquisitions is succeeding in growing our rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth as we make prudent investments in our systems with constructive regulatory outcomes.\nLet's move to Slide 18 and review the major components of our 10-year capital investment expenditure plan. Our focus continues to be infrastructure renewal at 68% to 70% of the plan through 2032. These investments are primarily for pipe replacement and upgrading water and wastewater treatment facilities.\nWe also expect to allocate 10% to 12% of our capital expenditures to resiliency in order to harden our systems, improve cyber and physical security, and address climate variability. This allocation has increased over where we've been historically. Our resiliency has been tested over the past few months with floods in California and the bitter cold temperatures in many of our service territories over this past holiday season.\nAs Susan said earlier, our systems and our teams did a great job of weathering the storms and preventing any major service disruptions during these recent events. It shouldn't be lost on our investors or other stakeholders that our employees in the field have the best skills, training and expertise in the industry, which leads to these great results when we're tested.\nOur commitment to make needed investments to enhance water quality remains very strong, including steps we're taking to improve our comprehensive source water protection programs and upgrade our treatment facilities. Every water provider must be prepared to address a broader range of contaminants and be ready to meet more stringent regulations.\nFinally, we'll continue to invest in new technologies to enhance our customer experience and enable our employees to drive efficiencies. Overall, our capital plan is very much aligned with our environmental goals and other ESG-related values that we prioritize as a company.\nLet's go to Slide 19 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on this slide is a summary of pending or recently completed general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure surcharges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states.\nAs Susan alluded to in her comments earlier, for us, the ability to execute on our regulatory strategies is a critical success factor for continuing to grow our business every year. However, we know that customer affordability is especially on minds of many utility investors and analysts heading into 2023, a topic I'll speak more about in a few minutes.\nBecause of these concerns, we believe our constructive rate case outcomes in 2022 should be tangible evidence of the support we have from regulators for needed infrastructure investments to deliver high-quality service to our customers.\nThe common thread in all of these general rate cases is the focus on recovery of infrastructure investments made since the last round of cases totaling over $4 billion, and in some states, the rolling of acquisitions. As we said, though, there are infrastructure mechanisms in several of our states that are reducing the lag of regulatory recovery. This works alongside our time frame between general rate cases of about 2 years in our bigger states.\nTurning briefly to active rate cases. Our cases in California and Missouri were filed in July and are progressing as expected so far.\nIn January of 2023, we filed an update in Missouri for costs and other needed elements of the case with hearings to be held this month. We expect the case to reach conclusion by the end of the second quarter of 2023.\nIn California, we recently applied for a Water Resources Sustainability Plan, which is an update to the general rate case. This plan requests the continuation of a decoupling mechanism that stems from legislation the governor recently signed that allows the California Public Utilities Commission to consider a decoupling mechanism.\nWe believe decoupling is a rate-making strategy that's good for both our customers and for the environment because it rewards customers for conserving water as we make investments to renew and improve our drinking water infrastructure.\nThe filing has also been updated with more timely customer demand estimates and to reflect present rates approved by the commission, effective January 1, 2023. The application itself includes infrastructure renewals, wildfire mitigation, climate resiliency efforts and strengthening affordability programs in addition to the new Water Resources Sustainability Plan.\nAnd in Virginia, we have a settlement on file and expect a final decision in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn the regulatory front outside of general rate cases, there were a few notable developments since our third quarter call. Staying in California and relating to the Monterey Water Supply Project, in November, the Coastal Commission approved our desalination coastal development permit application after many years of community discussion and in light of some additional commitments from us to the community.\nThen in December, the California Public Utilities Commission issued its decision that authorizes us to enter into an amended water purchase agreement and addressed rate recovery for the associated facilities.\nSubsequently, we filed an application for rehearing, requesting inclusion of all infrastructure costs in the cost cap for the groundwater replenishment project expansion and requested AFUDC that was not included in the decision. We are awaiting a ruling on our application.\nAmerican Water is committed to being a solutions provider to the communities in Monterey County, both through the advances in the water supply project and through maintaining our current level of operations in the area. Just last month, several communities in Monterey were impacted by evacuations due to flooding that occurred there. Because of our amazing employees and reliable assets, California American Water maintained normal service to its customers during this challenging time. Finally, in California, we're still awaiting a ruling from the commission on the pending cost of capital case.\nSwitching gears to Pennsylvania. Last month, the Department of Environmental Protection issued a maximum contaminant standard for 2 PFOS chemicals. Based on our proactive testing, we've identified 1 American Water location in Pennsylvania that requires action based on the new regulations.\nThe treatment upgrade for that facility was already in process and is anticipated to be online later this year. In the meantime, we've taken the contaminated well out of service temporarily to manage PFOS levels in the water provided to our customers and ensure early compliance with the new regulations.\nWe are still awaiting the new U.S. EPA standards, which we anticipate will be delivered later this year. We've already performed significant testing and analysis across our systems in compliance with state level guidance and have been acknowledged for that work, which will help inform our action plans when the EPA issues its standards.\nFor example, our Short Hill Station project in New Jersey was completed to meet New Jersey state regulations and was recognized with the Governor's Environmental Excellence Award in 2020 for its leadership in water treatment related to PFOS removal.\nBroadly, we believe we are the leaders in the industry on this topic, as evidenced by our work with the Water Research Foundation on PFOS communications and other projects. Our research scientists are frequently invited by the EPA, NARUC, AWWA, and the Water Research Foundation to speaking engagements that inform stakeholders and colleagues in the water industry.\nFinally, we were honored to be the only private utility invited to a recent event at the White House focusing on reducing lead exposure, replacing both the companies' and customers' portions of lead service lines is a part of our current capital plan.\nOur goal is to replace a significant majority of known lead service lines in our service areas by the year 2030. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 20 that we have $416 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2022.\nThis includes $308 million from general rate cases and step increases and $108 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have $181 million of total annualized revenue request pending, which includes 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings.\nThroughout the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to cover infrastructure investments and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for growth in the business.\nBecause we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes as we did in 2022.\nOn Slide 21, as I mentioned earlier, customer affordability is front and center in the utility industry in 2023. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed.\nThankfully, as we now have another full year's data to reflect on, our company is still in a very good relative position in terms of affordability or wallet share at less than 1% of median household income. We continue to believe that our affordability proposition is an important differentiator.\nAnd finally, on Slide 22, I'd like to highlight an ESG story that is a bit different than the others we have shared this past year. We're proud to say that American Water earned the SAFETY Act Designation from the Department of Homeland Security in 2022, the first water and wastewater company to do so. Not only is this great recognition of the work we do every day to keep our employees and community safe, but it also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our processes and increase knowledge sharing with the U.S. government.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator and begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nVP of IR, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions.\nHowever, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our September 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nAnd finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will discuss third quarter and year-to-date highlights and touch on 2023 guidance and our long-term targets. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our financial results in more detail to provide an update on active general rate cases and acquisition activity, and we'll close with further details on our 2023 and longer-term outlook, including the overall financing plan. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan, rate base growth expectations and our focus on affordability. Cheryl will then conclude with a review of some important new operating goals and disclosures that align with our focus on ESG. We'll then close by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron said, we have a lot to discuss this morning in addition to third quarter results. And specifically, we also want to cover today our outlook for 2023 and our longer-term targets. As you know, last year, at this time, we shared some significant news when we sold our Homeowner Services business to transition to a pure-play regulated water and wastewater utility. In that update, we announced a new 5-year plan and acceleration of capital investments and some adjustments to our financial targets. The updates that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of last year's plan and targets with adjustments primarily reflecting the shift out to 2027 in our 5-year outlook. We will also share additional thoughts and plans around our continuing ESG journey.\nSo let's dive in and turn to Slide #5, where I'll start by covering some highlights of 2022 to date. In the first 9 months of 2022, earnings were $3.70 per share compared to $3.40 per share in the same period of 2021. Strong organic growth and increased earnings from infrastructure investments continue to be our year-over-year drivers for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Favorable weather also added to results in the third quarter. Though we generally, like others, are experiencing a higher cost environment, our team continues to deliver on our financial and operating plans. This includes staying on track to achieve our total capital investment goal of $2.5 billion in 2022 and executing on significant regulatory activities, including constructive settlements in 2 of our outstanding general rate cases. Further, we continue to effectively manage and mitigate cost increases and have been successful in recent regulatory efforts to further lessen the impact of inflationary pressures into the future. These regulatory solutions are very important to our ability to manage inflationary headwinds as we move into 2023.\nSo I'm pleased that we've successfully executed our plan so far this year in a challenging and very active period. John and Cheryl will provide additional details on financial, operating and regulatory results later in today's call. But before I move on, let me comment about how excited we were to sign an agreement a few weeks ago to serve the nearly 15,000 customers of the Butler Area Sewer Authority in Western Pennsylvania. This is another great example of how partnerships with municipalities can lead to positive outcomes for customers, employees and the community at large. Our team worked very hard to understand the community's objectives and created an opportunity that we believe benefits all stakeholders.\nTurning to Slide 6. As announced yesterday, we affirmed our 2022 earnings guidance. We continue on track to meet our expectations for the year as we've indicated throughout the year. And in addition, we have had the incremental contribution from weather this quarter. Also yesterday, we initiated our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. This near-term plan as well as our longer-term plan remains very strong, and with our record of execution we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings expectations for 2023.\nLater, John will talk more about the drivers of our growth in 2023, but our expected growth builds on the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth last year. As we've said many times, the full effect on earnings growth from the increasing capital spending will ramp up over time. John will talk further about our updated financing plan, but this plan reflects our prior discussion that the growing investment plan will result in regular access to equity capital. As we've illustrated on this slide, we expect our investments in infrastructure and regulated acquisitions to drive significant earnings growth through '27 and beyond.\nFinally, on Slide 7, I want to make a few comments about our purpose here at American Water and how that drives our growth strategy, our operating plans and our company's targets and goals. Our mission is to provide safe, clean, affordable and reliable water and wastewater services to the communities across the country. Our services are vital to sustaining life. So while much has said in the news about the clean energy transition that's happening, what drives us every day is an equally important need in our country. We believe that everyone should have access to safe, clean, affordable and reliable drinking water and wastewater services and that communities are stronger because American Water has the privilege to serve them.\nIt's true that we have many similarities to the utilities, and we embrace the knowledge sharing and best practices that can come with those similarities. In fact, we joined EEI as a strategic partner a few years ago because of common values around customer service, safety and cybersecurity, to name just a few. And as many of you know, I've spent most of my career in the gas and the electric industry. So I have a deep appreciation for the utility industry as a whole.\nHowever, the water industry and American Water also have some important differences from other utilities. Our capital projects, for example, are much smaller on average than those in the electric and natural gas industries. Even though they add up to a similar and very significant investment need. Another difference is our greenhouse gas emissions footprint, which is very small compared to most other publicly traded electric and gas utilities. That said, we are seeing the impacts that climate variability can have through more extreme droughts or more severe floods. We strongly believe we must do our part to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. We have now set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals, including achieving net zero by 2050. Along with our goals for system resiliency, and water use and efficiency, we see our greenhouse gas reduction goals as part of our commitment to provide superior and affordable service to our customers.\nWe believe American Water is the leader in a clean water and wastewater transition in the United States. For the communities we already serve and the communities we hope to serve in the future, the capital investment needs that are required to deliver more sustainable water and wastewater services are immense. It's up to us to find ways to balance those CapEx needs with the affordability of services for our customers. That's why we've added a customer affordability target to our list of key drivers you see here. As a company, we also continue to raise the bar on our efforts to create a fair and equitable place to work in addition to making sure our operations align with the spirit of environmental justice. Two recent examples of our broad focus were the recognition through the 2022 WaterSense Excellence Award from the Environmental Protection Agency and the 2022 leading disability employer by the national organization on disability. Cheryl will provide some examples later of the good things we are doing internally in these areas.\nFinally, on this slide, you can see we are affirming our long-term earnings growth targets, and most of our other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. During our planning process this fall, we decided to narrow our long-term dividend growth target to 7% to 9%, which maintains our position in the top tier of dividend growth and payout ratio in the industry. Our long-term dividend growth target now fully aligns with our compelling EPS growth target of 7% to 9% and the significance of our capital investment plan and related financing. This minor adjustment rounds out our strong long-term plan and will help us achieve our other important financial targets over time.\nIn summary, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth supported by significant and yet low-risk capital investment plan as well as our ESG leadership premium and constructive position on affordability will continue to be rewarded by investors. Based on the long-term plan and our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover more detail on our 2022 financial results, our 2023 and longer-term outlook and our financing plans. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. Let me provide a few more details on third quarter results. Regulated results in total increased $0.16 per share compared to the prior year. We saw a $0.32 per share increase related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, weather was favorable by an estimated $0.07 per share year-over-year due primarily to warmer and drier conditions in 2022.\nO&M and other expense increased by $0.10 per share, which reflects an estimated $0.07 of inflation on chemical, power and fuel costs and higher interest rates. Depreciation expense also increased $0.04 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. And as you know, 2021 third quarter results included $0.09 per share of operating earnings from our former New York subsidiary. Finally, the market-based business and other results decreased in the third quarter of 2022, as the $0.09 per share of operating earnings from HOS in the third quarter of 2021 was offset by the $0.06 per share of earnings in 2022 from interest income and revenue share agreements.\nMoving to Slide 10. Consolidated results increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the third quarter. While I won't go through all of the details of the year-to-date results. In short, we are pleased with our financial performance over the first 9 months of the year. Our leaders across the business have adjusted to the changing economic environment in 2022. Their ability to do so has put us in a good position to achieve the full year operating results we laid out in our initial '22 guidance a year ago. Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover the regulatory activity in our states. Shown here is our summary of completed rate cases in 2022 and key facts for each of the rate case filings so far this year. In the appendix, we also share some details of changes in our infrastructure charges year-to-date. These efforts reflect Susan's comment on our team's ability to execute our regulatory strategies, which is the critical success factor for continuing to grow our business.\nAs we've said before, the common thread in all of these cases is the focus on recovery of infrastructure investments made since the last round of rate cases totaling over $4 billion, and in some states, the roll-in of acquisitions. As we continue to ramp up capital investments in 2023, it will take time to see recovery of those investments in rates. We continue to expect to file general rate cases generally every 2 years in our bigger states. As we have already communicated in August 2022, the New Jersey BPU approved the settlement of our rate request authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $61 million. The new rates became effective on September 1, 2022. Two key outcomes in this case were the incorporation of our request to update estimates of production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs, and the approval of deferral accounting for pension expense beginning January 1, 2023. The success of our proactive regulatory approach to these pressures will lessen the risk to shareholders into the future.\nTurning back to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in 5 jurisdictions. In 2 of these states, Pennsylvania and Virginia, we have reached settlement agreements with the parties and have on file petitions for approval of the settlements. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in late April, seeking recovery of $1.1 billion of investments since the prior case. The settlement provides for a total annualized revenue increase of $150 million and incorporates updated estimates of pension and OPEB expense.\nSimilar to New Jersey, this settlement also includes increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. In the coming weeks, an administrative law judge will review the settlement filing and render a recommendation to the Pennsylvania Commission regarding approval of the settlement. After its review, the commission will issue a final order. We expect the order by January 2023, with new rates to be effective as of January 28, 2023.\nMoving on to Virginia. In late September, a settlement agreement supported by all parties, except one, was filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and provides for a $12 million annual revenue increase compared to our original request of $15 million. A final decision in this case is expected in the first quarter of 2023. In Illinois, where it's been about 6 years since our last general rate case, progress has been steady since our February filing, and last Friday, a proposed order was issued by the cases' administrative law judges. We view the key terms of the proposed order is very constructive, including recommended approval of our updated revenue request to capture higher production costs and expected higher pension costs. We expect a final order in the case by January at the latest. Our cases in California and Missouri were filed in July and are progressing as expected so far. In January of 2023, we will file an update in Missouri for costs and other elements of the case as needed with hearings then to be held in February. We expect the case to reach conclusion by the end of the second quarter 2023.\nOn the legislative front, there was one additional notable piece of legislation signed since our second quarter call. California Senate Bill 1469, which allows the commission to consider and authorize the implementation of a decoupling like mechanism. The legislation was signed by the governor on September 30, 2022, and will become effective on January 1, 2023. Our California subsidiary is grandfathered into the previous water revenue adjustment mechanism through the end of our current rate case or 2024 and the team is working to renew decoupling under the new mechanism and the general rate case that was filed July 1 for our next rate period beginning in 2024.\nTurning to Slide 12 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, as Susan mentioned, we were excited to announce in October, our agreement to purchase the Butler Area Sewer Authorities Wastewater System for $232 million. This agreement was executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation, which is a framework that exists across 11 of the states in which we operate. Through September, we have closed on $308 million of acquisitions in 2022, which represents about 65,000 customer connections, and we are excited to have nearly $350 million of signed purchase agreements through October, which sets us up for 2022 and 2023 to be strong years for growth through acquisitions.\nWith the pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections, we expect to continue this track record of success. On Slide 13, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2023 results in our EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by capital investment to serve our customers and earning a return on that investment. As we've talked about previously, 2022 is year 1 of our accelerated CapEx plan, so it will take some time to ultimately see the ramp-up reflected in earnings. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. I'd like to add that our Military Services Group does add incrementally to our earnings growth expectation as we have continued to show on our growth triangle.\n2023 results will benefit from MSG's successful addition of its first Navy contract that we announced earlier this summer. Just as critical to our strategy is our ability to recover in rates, the operating costs; it takes to run the business, which goes to my final point on the slide. The regulatory solutions we are pursuing such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms are closely aligned with the interest of regulators and customers in managing affordability and limiting variability of customer bills, which ultimately aligns with our investors' interests as well. As we conclude this current round of rate cases, we expect to have in place regulatory solutions for over 75% of the inflationary costs we anticipate in the near term, including pension, interest and production costs. And as always, our team remains vigilant and disciplined on cost management.\nFinally, related to pension, I'd simply remind you that our pension obligation remeasurement will be done at year-end 2022 and that will drive the determination of our 2023 pension expense. Wrapping up the 2023 outlook on Slide 14. Here, we are providing some more specifics regarding the key drivers for 2023 that I just discussed. This slide demonstrates the importance of our regulatory execution and the results it drives. It also reflects the financing plans we expect to execute in 2023 that support our capital investment plan, which is an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years as compared to last year's plan. You will notice that we have included a bar for incremental debt and equity financing, which reflects the cost of incremental debt issuance in 2023 to support our growth as well as equity to be issued in 2023, which I will address on the next slide.\nOur cost of increased interest rates on 2022 debt balances is captured in the cost inflation and interest rates bar, the majority of which is being recovered through the current round of rate cases as just described. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this plan for 2023. Turning to Slide 15. I'll provide a financing plan update before closing with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile. Our financing plan now includes an estimated $2 billion of equity issuances from 2023 through 2027, which is an update to the $1.1 billion of equity financing need through 2026 we have previously discussed. Consistent with our prior messaging on mid-plan timing, subject to market conditions, we are likely to raise a significant portion of the total planned equity in 2023. The increase in the anticipated total equity need is driven largely by the $1 billion of increased CapEx that extends through 2027 in this new plan, along with adding some incremental balance sheet capacity. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of planned equity not completed in 2023 is expected to be issued near the end of the 5-year plan.\nAs we've said for several quarters now, we expect equity will be a regular financing tool going forward to help fund our growth and maintain a strong balance sheet. Let me conclude by turning to Slide 16 with a reminder that we have a strong balance sheet and credit profile. I'm confident our new 5-year plan is supportive of our current credit ratings as well as our long-term financial target of less than 60% debt to total capital. Another thing I'll point out is our debt maturity profile at the bottom left of the slide. We believe these levels, along with our planned debt issuances are very manageable. In a rising interest rate environment, it's important that the company has taken a laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years in order to minimize interest rate risk. And as the utility that predominantly invests in long-term assets, I expect us to continue to exclusively issue fixed rate long-term debt to protect against the risk of interest rate volatility.\nOn liquidity, we continue to remain confident that we have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. In fact, we just announced that we increased our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility by $500 million each to $2.6 billion and $2.75 billion, respectively, and we extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to October 2027. We believe these actions were appropriate to support our growing business and increased capital investment plan.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our CapEx and rate base growth plan, affordability and some new sustainability goals in more detail. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nExecutive VP & COO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 18, I'll start by talking about our updated capital plan. I want to first acknowledge that our teams have done a great job executing on our accelerated capital investment plan in 2022. We're on pace to meet our overall capital plan of $2.5 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments. Looking ahead to 2023, we plan to again step up our investment level this time to roughly $2.9 billion, which will generally be our new annual threshold for the next several years. As John just mentioned, over the next 5 years, we expect to invest approximately $14 billion to $15 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over our previous plan.\nThis increase is mostly driven by including the increased investment for 2027 in the 5-year window as well as about $250 million of inflationary impacts expected in the near term. We expect this pace of spend to drive our current pipe replacement cycle plan lower and much better than the industry average. On the longer horizon, you can see that we plan to spend approximately $30 billion to $34 billion in our regulated business over the next 10 years.\nWe see this capital plan to be largely in line with last year's plan, reflecting the higher annual run rate as well as modestly higher costs for pipe and other capital goods. Turning to Slide 19. This graph illustrates that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding and growing the regulated business at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth as long as we continue to prudently invest in our systems and successfully execute the regulatory process.\nMoving on to our regulatory recovery strategy on Slide 20, our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out bill increases to our customers, which helps promote affordability. It's beneficial to our customers that we operate in states that have constructive regulatory mechanisms. We've engaged with policymakers and regulators for well over a decade to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, while putting the customer first. In the states where we operate, 27 new mechanisms have been added over the past 12 years. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes.\nI'd also like to discuss timely recovery of our investments across our footprint with the pie chart on the right side of the page. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we are able to reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This enables us not only to earn our [lab] return, but also to mitigate the size of the general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 45% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.\nTurning to Slide 21. Our focus on operating efficiency has been a part of our company's DNA for many years. As you know, we've historically used O&M efficiency as one of our benchmark metrics to measure our success at managing costs as we grow the business. This focus positioned us well to manage through much of the pressure over the last couple of years on the supply chain and even cost increases brought about by the effects of the pandemic. As we look ahead, we've been asked if we can go below the 30% efficiency threshold.\nWhile we're continuing to evaluate that question, we've continued to emphasize that revenue growth has been just as important to our success with O&M efficiency as managing costs. So with that realization in mind, there may very well be additional opportunity to go below the 30% threshold. However, we're analyzing whether this is the best metric by which to judge our effectiveness at managing costs and running an efficient business.\nMoving to Slide 22. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, as we sit here today, our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. In fact, as investors and analysts study the sustainability of American Water's long-term earnings growth potential, we believe our affordability proposition is an important consideration. We realize, though, that we must continue to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We must also consider our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and a sharp focus on cost management in order to deliver on values around customer affordability.\nMoving on to Slide 23, and as Susan mentioned earlier, we are excited to announce our new science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and our first disclosure of estimated Scope 3 emissions. Before we dive in, I'll walk you through our greenhouse gas emissions profile in a bit more detail.\nAs an essential service provider, American Water is often compared to the broader utility sector emissions included, which can be misleading. As Susan noted earlier, is an important distinction that our emissions footprint as a water utility is much smaller than most publicly traded gas and electric companies on both an absolute and per customer basis. To help put it into context, American Water represents just 0.1% of the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions produced by the top 20 largest U.S. utilities measured by market cap. As we show on the slide, our total emissions footprint is made up of 7% direct Scope 1 emissions, such as heating, cooling and fleet; 44% indirect Scope 2 emissions or our purchased power; and 49% estimated Scope 3 emissions, which for us largely includes purchased goods and services, capital goods and fuel and energy-related activities.\nFraming it in a different way, more than 90% of our overall emissions footprint is generated from external sources, which is another key differentiator from most other utilities. Turning to Slide 24, there's a lot to unpack here. Let me say first, at a high level, we believe it is prudent for our company to focus our efforts on environmental initiatives that are in the purview of a water utility and aligned with our core mission. Our view is that greenhouse gas emission reductions fit as part of our sustainability strategy that, over time, will help protect customers against service disruptions from more severe weather patterns such as droughts and floods. We believe we've set forth new compelling goals to support this strategy. First, we expect to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 50% by 2035 from a 2020 baseline. Second, we expect to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050.\nWe believe these new medium- and long-term emissions goals are rooted in science and aligned with the Paris Agreement. We also believe our approach is a responsible path that considers all of our stakeholders' interest including doing our part by setting ambitious reduction goals. Our approach here will allow us to stay on course with our customer affordability metrics, as we continue to deliver clean, safe, affordable and reliable water to our customers.\nThis was a foundational component of our analysis and recent discussion with our Board Level SETO Committee, which oversees our safety, environmental, technology and operations efforts. It's also important to note that as we deliver water and wastewater solutions to more customers over time through acquisitions and organic growth, our energy usage is going to increase. We will re-baseline each year to account for our growth through acquisitions of systems, which is an acceptable practice under the standards of the science-based targets initiative, or SBTI. We did consider making a commitment to SBTI as part of our analysis this year. However, we concluded that some of SBTI's expectations around Scope 3 commission commitments mostly around timing were not in the best interest of our stakeholders. We do expect, though, to continue to work with our suppliers and vendors to consider what can be done to reduce Scope 3 emissions over time. And as I stated, we are confident that our new medium- and long-term Scope 1 and Scope 2 goals are science-based and aligned with the Paris Agreement.\nAs you can see at the bottom of the slide, these are more than just goals. We have plans in place and capital ready to deploy to achieve these goals, obviously, with greater visibility to the path to 2035. Since our footprint is heavily weighted by Scope 2 emissions, the continued greening of the electric grid is a significant component of our reduction plan. We hope to see that transition continue by our fellow utilities and other providers.\nFor us though, we know that it is cost prohibitive and outside of our core competencies to self-generate all or even a significant portion of our power needs. We will, though, continue to look to enter into clean purchase power agreements or partner on renewable investments, where appropriate, similar to our engagement with New Jersey Resources on the floating solar array at one of our treatment plants in New Jersey. Lastly, we will continue to focus on emissions reduction activities that we can control within our operations.\nThis includes water efficiency and operational efficiency gains in order to reduce the energy and emissions associated with the pumping of water, which we disclosed previously is by far the largest driver of our purchase power needs. Capital projects will include the deployment of additional leak detection technologies and more efficient water pumps across our systems as well as converting some of our fleet vehicles and other assets to more efficient options. These are small, but important pieces of our plan. And in large part, these capital investments will align perfectly with some of our existing reliability and resiliency goals.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 25 and discuss some new disclosures related to our continued ESG journey. First, soon, we will release summary results of our most recent pay equity study on our ID&E website, diversityataw.com. This is our third such pay equity study, and each time we have engaged a third-party consultant to conduct an objective pay equity analysis, I'm pleased to share that you will see that we're very close to achieving pay parity across employee groups, including gender. Our performance is a testament to American Water's commitment to fair and equal pay, and how our teams have leveraged findings from these regular assessments to correct inequalities and update processes around compensation. We will also share some initial summary findings of our internal labor market analysis that began in 2021. This analysis was also led by a third-party firm and was commissioned because we believe the factual and statistical analysis of our workforce was needed to support a holistic evidence-based inclusion, diversity and equity strategy.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on 2 of our new goals that were established earlier this year in our annual performance plan. The first is to increase representation of female employees at American Water and the second is to increase ethnic and racial diversity among American Water employees. Both of these goals complement existing safety and environmental sustainability goals that are tied to annual performance plan compensation for all employees. As mentioned earlier, these goals reflect our company's focus on social benefits that we believe will help us operate as a stronger company, ultimately for the benefit of our employees and to help us better reflect the customers and communities we serve. Whether it's our ESG leadership or consistent execution on our earnings growth goals or our leading safety culture, our team at American Water has consistently raised the bar for success in the water and wastewater industry. We have full confidence in our ability to achieve the goals we talked about today for 2023 and beyond.\nSo with that, I'll stop and turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nSenior Director of IR, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jordan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nLet me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions.\nHowever, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nThe reconciliation for the calculation of the O&M efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the accompanying slide deck, which has been posted to the Investor Relations page on our website. All statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.\nSusan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will discuss second quarter and year-to-date highlights and our focus on managing costs in today's inflationary environment. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our financial results in more detail, review our affirmed 2022 earnings guidance and long-term targets, and we'll close with an update on recent acquisition activity. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then review the progress of our investments year-to-date in the Regulated Businesses. We'll share some key details and milestones for several of our active general rate cases, and we'll conclude with another of our ESG impact stories. We'll then close by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let me also say how happy we are to have John Griffith with us as our CFO, and you'll hear more from John shortly.\nLet's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. In the first 6 months of 2022, earnings were $2.07 per share compared to $1.87 per share in the same period of 2021. Results for the regulated business drove the majority of the growth, accounting for $0.16 of the $0.20 increase while MSG and other results were up $0.04 as compared to the same period in 2021.\nThe regulated growth was in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in 2021 and early 2022 and from infrastructure mechanism filings. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs, which I'll talk more about shortly.\nOur regulated business invested over $800 million in capital projects and acquisitions for the quarter and $1.25 billion year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for executing these investments. As you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2022 included the $235 million acquisition of the City of York's wastewater system that we were excited to close in May.\nCoupled with our strong first quarter results, our capital investments are off to a good start for the year and on pace to meet our $2.5 billion goal for the year. We continue to stay focused on the plan. And as you saw yesterday, we have now for the third time affirmed our 2022 earnings guidance. And John will cover 2022 results and guidance in more detail a little later in the call.\nBefore I move on, let me comment again about how excited we are to welcome the customers and employees of York's wastewater system to the American Water family. As we've said, this is the largest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water history, and it's a great example of how municipal acquisitions are executed. The importance of understanding the community's objectives can't be underestimated, and we jointly created an opportunity that benefits all stakeholders.\nAnd as we think about the competitive landscape for water and wastewater acquisitions, we continue to focus on growing in states where we can leverage our competitive advantage. As we've said many times before, we target acquisitions in the range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers, where we have constructive regulatory environments and existing footprint and critical mass. This critical mass is important in our efforts to promote customer affordability and cost efficiencies.\nAlso, as we grow in each state, we will have a greater voice to help solve industry challenges through legislative and regulatory policies. So while we won't be awarded every opportunity we pursue, we know that there are plenty of communities in need, and we believe our 135-plus year history of delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services will enable us to continue to achieve a high success rate in our pursuits.\nThe final highlight I'll cover here is that the Military Services Group had another great win at the end of the second quarter. And I'll let Cheryl give you the details, but the award of our first Navy contract at Mayport adds to the 17 other military installations that we're very proud to serve.\nTurning to Slide 6. I'll take a few minutes here to provide a review of the macroeconomic environment and how we are managing the impacts to the company. Our focus on operating efficiency is not new, as you know. In the chart at the bottom of Slide 6, you can see the result of our disciplined focus on managing costs as we grow the business. This focus has positioned us well to have managed through much of the pressure so far on supply and even cost increases brought about with the effects of the pandemic.\nNow as we are in what may be an extended period of inflationary pressure, we continue to exercise our disciplined approach to cost management by leveraging our scale. And through midyear, while we are experiencing cost increases in certain supplies and energy, the impacts to date have been fairly modest.\nIn terms of our most significant costs, labor is our biggest operating expense by far. We work regularly with our union leadership to secure contract renewals. And so far, we have been able to achieve very fair outcomes. For our nonunion workforce, we're focused on filling key roles and maintaining our practice of competitive compensation.\nChemical costs and purchase power are usually the next biggest operating cost. While our supply chain strategies and purchasing power have helped mitigate chemical cost increases, especially as compared to our peers, we do expect higher O&M costs this year due to higher chemical prices.\nFor many years now, the supply chain team has been successful in partnering with operations to secure reliable, cost-effective power and fleet fuel contracts across our footprint. And because of these efforts, we expect only modest power and fuel cost increases in 2022.\nOverall, we estimate an impact of about $0.06 to $0.08 per share of these types of cost increases year-to-date, which we've been able to generally offset through other results. Later, John will talk more about the possible impacts on the year. But as I said, we are confident in our ability to hit our earnings expectations for the year.\nAnd perhaps one final comment before I talk about how we're pursuing regulatory solutions for this rising production cost environment. Certainly, a lot has been written over the last few weeks about pension accounting and expense levels going forward. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just under 90% as of year-end 2021 with a roughly 50-50 target allocation for equity and fixed income.\nThough there has been much volatility in the equity markets through midyear, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2022, and that will drive the determination of our 2023 expense. The accounting method we use includes using the fair market value of planned assets at year-end to establish the expected return on plan assets. And we also used the quarter approach for amortizing gains and losses.\nThese methods were selected many years ago and have resulted in moderate variability in pension expense, both favorable and unfavorable over the years, which we've always managed as part of our overall cost management approach. This includes regulatory solutions such as the pension trackers we have in place in Missouri and California, and updates to pension expense in active general rate cases.\nAs an example of how we are addressing these costs in current cases in the Illinois case currently on file, we requested and received approval last week to update the requested revenue requirement for increased costs including an estimated increase in pension costs. That request will be considered in this case.\nAnd that goes to my final point on this slide around regulatory solutions. Our teams throughout the company know that regulatory execution is vital to meeting our earnings objectives and our financial plan generally. The regulatory solutions we are pursuing such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms in all of the current active cases are closely aligned with the interest of regulators and customers in managing affordability and limiting variability of customer bills.\nThis is no doubt a challenging environment, we all find ourselves in, but we remain confident in our ability to manage through it using our disciplined approach to cost management and our ability to execute effectively in the regulatory environment.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to John to cover more detail on our operating results and financing plans. John?\n\nJohn C. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. I recall Susan saying on the first quarter earnings call that it had been a privilege to serve as CFO, but she was thrilled, it was her last one in the role.\nSo before I get started with the results, let me just say that I'm thrilled to take the baton from Susan as CFO at American Water and joined this great team.\nSo with that, turning to Slide 8, let me provide a few more details on second quarter results. Regulated results in total increased $0.02 per share compared to the prior year. We saw a $0.16 per share increase related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. As a reminder, prior year results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share of favorable weather in the second quarter.\nO&M expense increased by $0.06 per share, which reflects some of the effects of inflation on chemical, power and fuel costs. Depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. The market-based business and other results increased $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021.\nThese results in 2022 include interest income on the seller note and earnings from revenue share agreements from the 2021 sale of homeowner services of $0.06 per share, while 2021 results included $0.08 per share of operating earnings from HOS. Results for the other segment also include interest expense on long-term debt financing in both periods, which has increased year-over-year.\nRelated to HOS, I also wanted to note that we recorded the final working capital true-up entries for HOS in the first half of the year, amounting to $0.08 of earnings. As we previously disclosed, we recorded a $0.02 loss on the sale of New York American Water in the first quarter.\nAs is often the case with an organization of our size, it is common to have in any given year, a number of pluses and minuses that generally offset. The net earnings contribution of $0.06 per share from these final 2 sale-related entries has helped to mitigate the impact of the inflationary pressures we have seen so far.\nMoving to Slide 9. Consolidated results increased $0.20 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. Results from the regulated business increased $0.16 per share for the year-to-date period. We saw a 34% -- $0.34 per share increase on higher revenues, somewhat offset by increases in O&M and other operating expenses of $0.08 per share and depreciation of $0.06 per share.\nThe market-based business and other results increased $0.04 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, with generally the same drivers as mentioned for the second quarter results.\nOverall, we're pleased with our financial performance over the first half of the year. The first half performance sets us up well to deliver on our full year financial plan.\nSpeaking of our 2022 plan, let's now turn to Slide 10. After a solid start to the year, as Susan mentioned, we are affirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. We expect strong revenue growth to continue in the second half of the year as we continue to earn returns on our infrastructure investments from prior years and see additional growth from acquisitions.\nSecond half results when compared to the prior year will be tempered by the sale of our New York American Water operations earlier this year, which historically had its biggest earnings contribution in the third quarter of each year. And as we mentioned, while we are working diligently to limit the impacts to the business of rising costs, we expect to see continued pressures in the second half of the year, primarily related to chemicals and interest expense.\nAs we've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of sale proceeds for HOS in New York. But the expected earnings from interest on the seller note and revenue from the utility revenue share agreements will nearly offset the loss of the prior annual earnings contribution from HOS.\nAs our team has previously shared, we'll continue to ramp up our capital investments over the next few years as a part of the accelerated investment plan rolled out last November. The earnings from that ramp-up of investment will follow.\nFinally, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we have in place, including 7% to 9% EPS growth and 8% to 9% rate base growth. We acknowledge the current macroeconomic headwinds and are factoring those in as we progress through our annual budgeting and planning process this summer. As expected, we will provide an updated outlook later this year for 2023 and the longer term.\nTurning to Slide 11 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle. We were pleased to announce in May our closing of the purchase of our -- of the purchase, the City of York's wastewater system for $235 million, where we are now serving approximately 45,000 customer connections. This agreement was executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation, which is a framework that exists now across 12 of the states in which we operate.\nTurning to a review of the nearly 30,000 customer connections under agreement as of June 30, Egg Harbor City is expected to close in the second half of 2022. Egg Harbor City is the first transaction under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future as it allows communities with significant operating challenges to avoid a public referendum and swiftly partner with a provider like us to address their issues.\nAnd just yesterday, West Virginia American Water announced a signed agreement with Jefferson Utilities to purchase the various water and wastewater system assets of Jefferson Utilities for $30 million. The combined systems serve almost 4,000 customer connections in West Virginia, and we expect to close this transaction by the end of this year.\nThe acquisition pipeline is still quite strong at approximately 1.3 million customer connections. The pipeline represents a multitude of potential acquisitions across many states in our footprint, including several additional opportunities that have emerged since our last call as well as the removal of 2 large deals, York now closed and another opportunity in Pennsylvania.\nLet's move to Slide 12 and a reminder that we have a strong balance sheet and credit profile. I believe that our plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it is supportive of our current credit ratings. This includes the $1.1 billion of equity financing we have previously discussed as we focus on achieving our long-term debt-to-capital target of 60%.\nWe will continue to work hard at maintaining our industry-leading credit ratings for the benefit, ultimately, of our customers. Importantly, these strong issuer ratings are also applied to our senior unsecured debt offerings enabling us to achieve strong financing outcomes like our recent debt offering in May, that's summarized in the appendix of today's slides.\nThe other thing I'll point out on this slide is our debt maturity profile on the bottom left of the slide. In a rising interest rate environment, it is important that the company has taken a laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years in order to minimize interest rate risk. I certainly agree with that strategy and expect to continue that wise approach.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our capital investments and Military Services Group results in more detail. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nExecutive VP & COO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While I usually start by reviewing the regulated segment's operating results, I want to start today on Slide 14 by covering the announcement coming from our Military Services Group just a few weeks ago. I'm so proud of MSG's latest award our first ever Navy contract. This contract continues the team's streak of utility privatization wins at military installations in recent years. With the addition of the wastewater contract with Naval Station Mayport, we are currently serving 18 installations with between 30 and 50 years remaining on these contracts.\nWe also have 2 other bids outstanding, one of which is expected to be awarded in 2023. And as you can see, we have a potential of about 70 additional opportunities in the years ahead. MSG's business model centers around adding new military installations to our portfolio and then optimizing revenues through new infrastructure construction projects on the bases we serve.\nA military installation's mission can change or expand or new technologies or system improvements may be identified that improve efficiency or sustainability. We work with our military partners to identify and lead these needed infrastructure projects. Again, we're extremely proud to provide vital services for the military personnel, their families and the civilians that support these missions.\nAs we turn to Slide 15, let's cover our regulatory activity in our states. Shown here is our summary of completed rate cases in 2022 and key facts for each of the rate case filings so far this year. In the appendix, we also share some details of changes in our infrastructure charges year-to-date. These key efforts reflect Susan's comment on our team's ability to execute our regulatory strategies.\nAs you can see on the slide, our New Jersey case is the furthest along with constructive discussions happening over the last few months. We're really pleased to report that on July 25, the parties to the New Jersey base rate case filed a stipulation of settlement with the Office of Administrative Law resolving all pending issues in the proceeding. The parties are waiting for an initial decision from the administrative law judge. And once it's issued, the matter will be returned to the Board of Public Utilities for a final determination.\nIn Illinois, it's been about 6 years since our last general rate case, and progress has been steady since our February filing. Evidentiary hearings will start next month, and we expect an order in the case by January.\nImportantly, Illinois utilizes a forward test year for rate-making purposes, which is helpful during this period of rising costs faced by the business.\nIn Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in late April and are seeking recovery of over $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including evidentiary hearings that will occur in September and with an order in this case also expected early next year. Pennsylvania also uses a forward test year for ratemaking purposes. Our cases in California and Missouri were just filed earlier this month and are progressing as expected so far.\nAnd finally, as you know, we have another case active in Virginia from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion in 2023. The common thread in all these cases is the focus on recovery of extensive infrastructure investments totaling over $4 billion and in some cases, the roll-in of acquisitions.\nAs we continue to ramp up capital investments over the next few years, it will take time to see recovery of these investments in rates. We expect to continue to file general rate cases every 2 to 3 years in our larger states with the ability to go in sooner if we see lingering inflationary impacts or excessive lag from investment, limiting our ability to earn our allowed return. Clearly, regulatory execution is critical to the success of our plans, and we are very confident in our teams that lead our regulatory efforts.\nAs always, we remain very focused on customer affordability. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies coupled with our customer growth efforts have continued to design and customer assistance programs to help our customers who are challenged with affordability.\nOn the legislative front, there were 3 additional pieces of legislation passed since our first quarter call, 1 in Illinois, 1 in Tennessee and 1 in Missouri. The Illinois bill is an important one to help address the affordability of our bills with certain customers.\nThe Tennessee bill requires all utilities in the state to implement a cybersecurity plan, and we are well positioned to comply. And lastly, the Missouri bill requires a utility to defer any difference in what was actually paid in state or local property taxes compared to what was used to set the revenue requirement. We believe our legislative efforts benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges.\nOn Slide 16, we summarize rate filings completed so far in 2022 as well as total annualized revenue increases being requested in currently active cases. The total of $598 million in pending cases, which includes 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings reflects the requested amounts in the various cases. Generally speaking, we would expect the final revenue increase granted in each case to go into effect in 2023 or 2024 in the case of California.\nTurning to Slide 17. Our Regulated Business leaders and their teams did a great job again in the second quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It took a significant effort to safely and efficiently complete the several hundred projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $300 million in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2 billion of regulated capital investment spending in 2022, the foundation of our earnings growth triangle.\nMoving to Slide 18. I want to just highlight that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding in growing our regulated rate base. This, of course, drives earnings growth while we remain focused on operating our systems safely and efficiently to the benefit of our customers.\nLike we have been doing the last several quarters, I'll close on Slide 19 with another story of ESG impact at American Water. This one comes from a collaborative project between New Jersey American Water and NJR Clean Energy Ventures. The partnership is constructing the largest floating solar array in the U.S. on a lake next to our Kanubrik water treatment plants.\nUpon completion later this year, this 8.9 megawatt installation will provide 95% of the plant's annual power needs and will help reduce our annual greenhouse gas emissions. This is another example of a project that creates a financial, operational and ESG win for us and our customers.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."

As a remainder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Investors Relations website.\nAnd I'd like to introduce the host for today's call, Mr. Aaron Musgrave, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may now begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nSenior Director of IR, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.\nLet me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our March 31, 2022, Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nAll statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President, CEO and CFO, will discuss first quarter financial results, 2022 earnings and long-term guidance and our commitment to ESG principles. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then review our regulated growth strategy, including capital investments and regulatory proceedings in the first quarter. Susan will then comment on some exciting news we shared yesterday regarding our executive management team before closing by answering your questions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President, CEO and CFO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO, CFO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron said, I'll comment further in just a few minutes about recent announced additions to our executive team. But I want to start by saying what a privilege it has been to serve as the company's CFO these past 3 years. But I also must say I'm thrilled that this will be my last call as the CFO.\nLet's turn to Slides 5 and 6, and I'll start by covering our first quarter financial results and then share some business highlights to start the year. In the first quarter of 2022, earnings were $0.87 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same period of 2021. Results for the regulated business drove all of the increase of $0.14 per share, while market-based business and other results were essentially flat as compared to the same period in 2021. Regulated results for the quarter reflect revenue increases from several general rate proceedings completed in 2021 and early 2022 as well as from infrastructure mechanism filings. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher depreciation and increased production costs due to some inflationary pressures on chemicals and energy prices.\nMarket-based businesses and other results were similar in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 with a loss of $2 million or $0.01 per share in both of those periods. But in those results, the $0.07 per share of earnings from HOS in 2021 was mostly offset in 2022 by the interest income and earnings from the revenue sharing agreements in place as a result of the sale of HOS late last year. While we're currently reflecting the interest income and revenue share contributions in other, they really do represent results driven by the regulated business and will even more so once the proceeds of the note receivable from the sale are received and redeployed into regulated capital investment. We will continue to report these pieces separately so that it's easy to track.\nFinally, our Military Services Group had similar results in both quarters, and our MSG team continues to expect an announcement on the Naval Station Mayport, Florida bid this summer. In addition to the strong quarter of earnings growth, our regulated business invested $437 million in capital projects and acquisitions in the quarter. This is a great start to the year and puts us on pace to meet our $2.5 billion capital investment goal in 2022.\nI may sound like a broken record here, but as we've said last year, when we announced our stepped-up capital spending plan, the increasing levels of investment will continue to ramp up during this year and over the next few years, and it will take time to see recovery of those investments in rates. We're now in the regulatory cycle that we've talked about before with general rate cases being filed every 2 to 3 years in our larger states.\nWe've already announced rate case filings in New Jersey and Illinois earlier this year, which are proceeding as expected. We'll be filing a general rate case in Pennsylvania tomorrow, and our next case in California next week, which follows the statutory cycle there. In aggregate, we expect to file 5 to 6 general cases in 2022, seeking to earn a return on over $4 billion of investment. Clearly, regulatory execution is critical to the success of our plans.\nLet me make one more comment on our investment progress before I move on. As you will recall, the $2.5 billion total capital investment planned for 2022 includes the $235 million anticipated acquisition of the City of York's wastewater system that we're very excited about. We're also excited though about the 30 other acquisitions across several states we have under agreement as of March 31. They demonstrate that the acquisition pipeline is quite strong.\nTurning to Slide 7. After a strong start to the year, we are affirming our 2022 guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. As we shared in February, our expected regulated earnings growth range in 2022 of $0.24 to $0.30 reflects new authorized rate levels in several jurisdictions. As expected, we saw much of that revenue increase related to new rates in the first quarter of 2022, including in Pennsylvania, which recorded a full quarter of the base rate increase from last year as well as the step increase effective January 1 of this year.\nWe also experienced about $0.03 per share of timing favorability for operating costs in the first quarter of '22 that we expect to reverse in later quarters.\nAs I've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of the sale proceeds from HOS in New York, but the expected earnings from interest on the seller note and revenue from the utility share agreements will nearly offset the loss of the prior annual earnings contribution from HOS.\nFinally, on Slide 7, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we set forth in November, including 7% to 9% EPS growth through 2026.\nMoving on to Slide 8. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.6025 per share to $0.6550 per share, a nearly 9% increase. Including this year's expected increase, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 9.6% over the last several years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. We plan to grow the dividend at the high end of the 7% to 9% -- 7% to 10% range as we know that is important to many of our shareholders.\nBefore I turn the call over to Cheryl, I want to cover a few important points related to our industry leadership in ESG. Coming in May, we plan to issue our second annual inclusion, diversity and equity report. This report will highlight the efforts we have undertaken and the strides we have made advancing our commitment to building an inclusive workplace. Within the report, you will find our first disclosure of consolidated EEO-1 data for American Water. Based on feedback from shareholders and ESG best practices, we made a commitment in our recently filed proxy statement to begin disclosing this data annually in 2022 and thereafter. This action will deliver on that commitment.\nWe are also pleased to be publishing in May, the second annual installment of our ESG data summary, which will be found on the Sustainability page of our Investor Relations website. The data summary will share numerous metrics for calendar year 2021, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.\nAs many of you know, American Water has achieved significant greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last decade. Due to the nature of our business and our emission reductions over the years, we are in a great position relative to a large majority of our utility peers. For example, we're able to talk about our emissions footprint in hundreds of thousands of metric tons, whereas most other utilities talk in terms of millions of metric tons.\nLast year, we came closer to achieving our current goal. We began the process of evaluating new greenhouse gas emission targets. This evaluation is well underway by a large cross-functional team and is running in parallel with our annual planning process. They are focused on diligent study and analysis, including the potential addition of the Scope 3 emissions and potential alignment with the Paris Agreement. The team expects to present its findings and recommendations to management and the Board later this year.\nI wanted to share this update with you today to demonstrate our commitment to transparency as one of the top ESG leaders in the industry. And with that, let me turn the call over to Cheryl to cover in more detail our operating results and strategies for '22. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nExecutive VP & COO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our regulated business leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter, executing on our increased capital plan. It took a significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2 billion of regulated capital investment spending in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 12. Shown here is our summary of rate case filings and legislative updates. On the legislative front, there are 3 pieces of legislation that have passed so far this year, 2 in Indiana and 1 in Virginia. The Virginia bill is an important confirmation of the use of stand-alone state-specific capital structure and ratemaking proceedings for investor-owned utilities. The 2 Indiana bills provide constructive outcomes around recovery of property taxes as well as promoting sound safety and asset management practices by all utilities in the state. We believe our legislative efforts benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges.\nAnd you can find in the appendix to today's presentation, a summary of some of our key legislative outcomes in the states we serve. You can also see on Slide 12, as Susan previously indicated, this is a very busy year for general rate cases. We filed 2 cases already in 2022 in New Jersey and Illinois. These 2 filings were driven by recovery of the extensive capital investments we've made since the last cases in those states, totaling more than $2 billion combined.\nIn New Jersey, this includes a filter rehabilitation project to improve water quality at the Raritan-Millstone plant serving more than 1 million people as well as projects to improve water quality at dozens of wells, pumping stations and other critical facilities serving customers throughout New Jersey.\nIn Illinois, investments include the replacement, lining and installation of approximately 141 miles of aging water and wastewater pipelines as well as the role of -- roll-in of nearly 30 acquisitions since the last general rate case. And as Susan mentioned, we expect to file 3 to 4 more cases this year, including the case in Pennsylvania tomorrow, where we'll be seeking recovery of over $1 billion of investments. Next week, we'll also be making an initial filing related to our general rate case in California, which is in keeping with the state's 3-year cycle. The California case will seek to recover nearly $600 million of forecasted capital investments and will include several closed and pending acquisitions.\nIn addition, we will be filing notice with the Missouri Public Service Commission tomorrow that we plan to file a case by midyear. And finally, as you know, we have 3 active cases from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion this year.\nMoving to Slide 13. To date, we have a total annualized revenue request of $220 million in pending cases, which includes 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Already in rates is $79 million in annualized new revenues since January of 2021. This includes $48 million from general rate cases and step increases excluding the agreed reduction in revenues for excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $31 million from infrastructure surcharges.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to roll in infrastructure investment and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for earnings growth. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in constructive outcomes. And as always, we remain very focused on customer affordability.\nOur emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies, coupled with our customer growth efforts have continued to deliver very affordable bills as a percentage of household income for most of our customers. We also continue to evolve our strategies around rate design to assist our low-income customers who are challenged with affordability. These efforts, in addition to our historical customer assistance programs as well as the programs we are implementing across our footprint funded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. These programs have already provided millions of dollars of support to our customers, and we support their continued funding.\nTurning to Slide 14 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, we were excited to announce on April 14 that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our application to purchase the City of York's wastewater system for $235 million. Signed just 1 year ago, York is the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history and is being executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation. We're thrilled to soon be serving approximately 45,000 customers there, and we expect to close the acquisition by or before mid-June.\nAnother acquisition under agreement is Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, which is the first transaction under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future as it allows communities with significant operating challenges to swiftly partner with a provider like us to address its issues. Egg Harbor City represents about 3,000 customer connections, and we also expect to close on this acquisition later this year.\nFinally, still on the acquisition front, a smaller but important one is the water system we are acquiring from the town of Waverly, Virginia that we expect to close in the next few months. This represents our first acquisition in Virginia under the fair market value legislation that was finalized in October of 2022. As a result, the pending closing is an important milestone as we work through this process for the first time in the state.\nI'll close on Slide 15 with the project coming from our Military Services Group that illustrates another example of ESG impact as a result of American Water's investment. MSG partnered with Hill Air Force Base in Utah to construct a net zero operation center to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions there. The building design focused on both reducing energy usage and also offsetting energy usage with solar panels. After project completion, the building not only met all of its power supply needs but also sent power back to the grid. This project is just one example of the many projects MSG undertakes at the 17 military installations it serves across the country that creates a financial win for both sides and an environmental win for us all.\nWith that, I'll now turn it back over to Susan for some closing remarks. Susan?\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO, CFO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cheryl. Turning to our final slide, Slide 16. And before we begin Q&A, I want to comment further on our announcement of the hiring of the CFO. As I'm sure you saw yesterday, we announced that John Griffith will be joining American Water as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective May 16. John comes to us from Bank of America and brings more than 25 years of industry knowledge and financial and transactional expertise. I personally know John and his capabilities. He is very talented and will bring the right skills at the right time to help American Water continue its journey of strategic execution and delivery of superior results.\nAs John joins us, our senior executive team is now fully in place. If you recall, Jim Gallegos, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, joined us on April 1 of this year. Jim brings nearly 20 years of regulated general counsel expertise and is already integrating nicely into the organization. We are thrilled to have both John and Jim on board now.\nAs I've said before, I'm confident in the plan that we have in place to grow this business, and I'm confident we have the right teams in place throughout our states, at the bases we serve and here in our corporate office to achieve our goals in 2022 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. Following the earnings conference call, an audio archive of the call will be available through February 24, 2022. U.S. callers may access the audio archive toll-free by dialing (877) 344-7529. International listed by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088 and the access code for the replay is 8387509. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.\nAnd I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\n\nAaron Musgrave\n\nSenior Director of IR, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions.\nHowever, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.\nAdditional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and November 31, 2021, Form 10-K, each filed yesterday with the SEC.\nThe reconciliation for the calculation of the O&M efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the accompanying slide deck, which has been posted to the Investor Relations page on our website. All statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.\nIn addition, for the purposes of the presentation, our long-term EPS CAGR range is anchored off of the normalized 2021 earnings per share results, our last reported actual results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President, CEO and CFO, Susan Hardwick.\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO, CFO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to take just a moment to say thank you for all of the thoughtful comments sent our way over the past few months to express your best wishes for Walter in his recovery. I also want to thank those who have reached out over the last few weeks with your encouragement for me in the role as CEO.\nIt's an honor and a privilege to serve this great company. And as I begin this journey, I want to reassure you that our strategy remains unchanged from what we shared with you in November of last year. This team is energized and is in execution mode to deliver on our commitment of 7% to 9% long-term earnings growth by continuing to invest in our infrastructure, grow our regulated operations through acquisition and support our military by growing our military services footprint.\nWe are focused on operating where we create the most value. And now as we've transitioned to a 100% regulated and regulated-like business, we believe we are positioned to deliver even higher quality earnings. There is no other water and wastewater service provider in the United States with our scale and capability.\nAnd for our investors that rely on our dividend, we are committed to grow our dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We know that the best way to secure your confidence in us is to deliver. That's exactly what we did in 2021 and what we are committed to do going forward.\nAnd with that, let's get to it. Turning to Slides 5 and 6. I'll start by covering our financial results and then share some highlights of our operational excellence in 2021. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, earnings were $6.95 per share compared to $3.91 per share in the same period of 2020. Full year and fourth quarter 2021 results include a gain of $2.70 per share, which reflects the completion of the sale of Homeowner Services in December reduced by the $0.19 per share contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation from the proceeds on the sale.\nFull year and fourth quarter 2021 results were $4.25 per share and $0.85 per share, respectively, before the gain on the sale of HOS. This represents an 8.7% growth over 2020 earnings, a strong result that is in line with expectations and demonstrates another year of successfully meeting our annual earnings guidance.\nEarnings in the regulated business in 2021 increased $0.40 per share. Regulated results include the impact of increased revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions offset somewhat by higher wages and other labor-related costs. Production, operating and maintenance costs and depreciation also increased in support of growth in the business.\nMarket-Based business results, apart from the gain on the sale of HOS decreased by $0.10 per share compared to 2020, primarily because of the timing of the sale of HOS. Parent company results were $0.04 per share higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. On the people side, I'm very proud that last year marked one of our company's best years of safety performance, an excellent outcome amid the ongoing operational challenges related to the pandemic.\nWe also witnessed the value of our resiliency investments in our New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland operations. We successfully withstood widespread flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida while our customers' drinking water quality was not impacted in any of our service areas.\nRelated to capital investments. Our regulated business achieved $1.8 billion of infrastructure improvements, replacements and other system work in 2021 to better serve our customers. As we made these investments, we continue to work hard to keep customer bills affordable by focusing on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business, along with achieving our supply chain successes throughout the pandemic.\nAs we discussed with you in 2021, regulated acquisitions continue to be a key component of our customer affordability and growth strategies. While we welcomed approximately 20,000 new customer connections through acquisitions in 6 states last year, we know that these results are lower than our annual targets. And of course, acquisition totals fluctuate year-to-year, but we are encouraged that we are currently -- that we currently have acquisitions under agreement covering about 77,000 customer connections to start the new year. Cheryl will talk more about our progress on acquisitions a bit later.\nAnd finally, we are pleased to have successfully executed on the sales of HOS and our New York and Michigan operations. As we outlined in November, we will redeploy the proceeds from these divestitures into our regulated business where we can best serve customers and drive efficiencies and thus create value for our customers, employees and shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 7. We believe the combination of our EPS growth, our dividend and an ESG premium continues to be rewarded by investors, securing our place as a top performer in the utility sector on total shareholder return for many years now. As you can see on this slide, we have delivered an exceptional total return to shareholders of 185% over the past 5 years, including our excellent dividend growth.\nBased on the long-term plans we've laid out in our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive total shareholder return for many years to come. Moving to Slide 8. I want to emphasize just a few points here. We continue to believe that our plan both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it is supportive of our current credit ratings.\nAs we've told you, both S&P and Moody's agreed with that. They both affirmed our ratings last year following our Investor Day presentation. This was due in part to the recognition of our shift to 100% regulated and regulated-like earnings, coupled with our decision to operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions. They affirm that our solid financial metrics are a good complement to our business profile.\nWe're proud that our A credit rating at S&P is 1 of only 2 in the industry. Our strong credit profile is something we value and we will continue to work hard at maintaining it for the benefit ultimately of our customers. The other thing I'll point out on this slide is our total debt to total capital metric. At the end of 2021, we were at 61%. After adding back to total debt, the initial HOS sales proceeds of $480 million yet to be deployed. This is about 1% better than where we added 2020 and puts us on a good path to our goal of roughly 60% by the end of our 5-year plan.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, let's turn to Slides 9 and 10 for a recap of some of the important strategies we laid out back in November. The map on Slide 9 clearly demonstrates our geographic diversity and how our scale and size are a key competitive advantage, especially when it comes to customer affordability. Because of our large customer base in each state, we're able to spread capital investment across that base, helping to maintain affordability for our customers.\nIncluding the 17 military installations we serve through our military services group, we provide drinking water and wastewater services to an estimated 14 million people in 24 states. On Slide 10, as we laid out in November, we plan to spend $13 billion to $14 billion over the next 5 years and approximately $28 billion to $32 billion over the next 10 years in our regulated business. These capital investments generate significant economic benefit to the local and regional economies while likely improving the environmental footprint of the systems in these communities. This is another demonstration of how the values of ESG are integrated into our everyday work.\nWe'll balance these investments through a disciplined regulatory strategy and strategic cost management to support customer affordability. And again, while there's a ramp-up time related to the increased capital and the recovery of those investments, our earnings will be more consistent and stable in the long term.\nTurning to Slides 11 and 12. Let's look ahead at our outlook for earnings in 2022 as compared to 2021. As we shared in our earnings release yesterday, we are affirming our 2022 guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. We thought it would be helpful to share some details of the drivers year-over-year since there are several moving parts.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, our regulated earnings growth range in '22 of $0.24 to $0.30 reflects the fact that we are filing several significant general rate cases in '22, along with labor costs and chemical cost pressures this year that may not be recoverable outside of a rate case. So we're back in that regulatory cycle that we've talked about before.\nAnd as I've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of sales proceeds from HOS in New York. But we will benefit from the interest income on the HOS note and the revenue share agreement in 2022, helping to offset the loss of earnings from HOS operations.\nFinally, on Slide 12, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we set forth in November, including 7% to 9% EPS growth through 2026, and we believe well beyond that. Next, I want to cover a few important points about ESG -- about our ESG efforts on Slide 13.\nAmerican Water has been recognized as an industry leader in ESG for many years now, and we're very proud of those accolades. Today, I want to highlight what I think is an underappreciated aspect of our ESG story, namely our decades-long runway of transformational impact in communities across the U.S.\nWe are positioned through our regulated acquisition growth strategy to lead significant environmental and social change in the communities we serve or will serve in the future. Slide 13 highlights this ESG impact opportunity for an acquired -- for our required systems. But the reality is our entire growth triangle has impactful ESG-related initiatives integrated within each area.\nAs you see and hear us continue to highlight this aspect of our ESG story, you'll begin to see our newly created ESG badge as shown on Slide 13. It will appear both internally and externally in our communications as we raise awareness of the integration of ESG principles and values in all that we do. And you'll see the water drop part of the badge shift from E to S to G as appropriate in order to highlight the key impact for the topic at hand.\nLet me close on Slide 14 with just 1 example of a story of ESG impact because of American Water's investment. This story comes from Indiana American Water, which serves over 1 million customers in that state. As some of you know, I'm originally from a small town in Indiana, that happens to be just a few hours from another small town in Indiana called Sheridan. A number of years ago, Sheridan was facing significant environmental compliance issues with the U.S. EPA related to its wastewater system.\nAs we so often see the issue became bigger than just an environmental one. The town was facing business development restrictions because of its noncompliance issues. And if you fast forward to today, you can see -- and as you can see listed there on that slide, the many positive changes that have occurred as we partnered with the community to solve those issues.\nIn the future, when you hear us talk about our acquisition pipeline of 1.3 million customer connections, I hope you'll see it in a different light. Sure, it means financial growth opportunity, which is very important to us, but it also means a long runway of opportunities to make a positive impact environmentally and socially.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to cover our operating strategies for '22 in greater detail. Cheryl?\n\nCheryl D. Norton\n\nExecutive VP & COO, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Susan. Before we dive into our growth triangle to review key operational and financial goals this year, let's turn to Slide 16 to cover our foundations for success in 2022. As Susan mentioned earlier, our strengths start with our unwavering commitment to safety, which is a leading indicator of our company's health, but we must get the other fundamentals of a high-performance culture right as well.\nStriving for operational excellence helps us work smarter, and it enables us to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for. This means we go well beyond minimum requirements in order to be the industry leader in operational and environmental excellence. This can only be achieved over the long run with a commitment to building collaborative high-performing teams.\nWe know that creating an equitable culture where people feel valued, included and empowered is critical to our ability to serve our customers every day. We share with our employees the ways that they contribute to the success of our company, which inspires them to make a positive difference for our customers and for the communities we serve.\nThe recognition of New Jersey and Illinois American Water for being ranked #1 within the J.D. Power 2021 water utility residential customer satisfaction study is truly a testament to our employees' commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. I'll talk more about growth in a few minutes.\nBut regarding ESG, we believe the spirit of ESG is just an affirmation of the values we've upheld for decades. From environmental leadership and sustainability to employee engagement and equity, to transparency and good governance. These principles are foundational to our corporate strategy.\nTurning to Slide 17. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to our regulated business leaders and their teams for achieving our goal of $1.9 billion of capital investments in 2021. It's no small feat to safely and efficiently execute the hundreds of projects across our territories each year.\nThis is especially true in years like 2021 when we reallocated capital midyear in response to a business need. We allocated additional capital to infrastructure investments in the second half of 2021 as we witnessed less of a need for capital acquisitions in the first half of the year. As we've discussed many times, the infrastructure needs across the business are significant, and our teams quickly adjusted to utilize the additional available capital. You can continue to expect us to shift capital between these 2 buckets each year to adjust for changing business conditions.\nLooking ahead to our step-up in regulated infrastructure investments in 2022 of $2 billion from $1.8 billion in 2021, we'll be focusing on a variety of projects across our footprint. As we've told you before, there are very few major projects in terms of dollar magnitude, but rather hundreds of smaller ones. A few projects planned for 2022 that stand out, though, include $8 million for intake pipe work at our Hopewell, Virginia water treatment plant and $13 million for pipeline and treatment improvements at our Hays Mine water treatment plant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nMoving to Slide 18. We want to briefly highlight our continued execution related to growing regulated rate base, which drives our earnings growth. We're also affirming our expectations of 8% to 9% rate base growth over the next decade, which aligns with the $25 billion to $28 billion of investment needs across our systems, plus the rate base we add through acquisitions.\nTurning to Slide 19. Shown here is our summary of rate case filings. 2022 is a very busy year for general rate cases. We filed 2 cases already in 2022 in New Jersey and Illinois. These filings are driven by recovery of the extensive capital investments we've made since the last cases in those states totaling more than $2 billion combined. We also have 4 active cases from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion this year, including West Virginia, where we invested almost $260 million in upgrading our infrastructure since our last case.\nTo show the magnitude of these filings to date, you can see on Slide 20 that we have a total annualized revenue request of $255 million, which includes 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Already in rates is $218 million in annualized new revenues since January of 2021. This includes $135 million from general rate cases and step increases, including the agreed reduction in revenues for excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $83 million from infrastructure surcharges.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to roll in infrastructure investment and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for growth in the business because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in constructive outcomes as we've demonstrated many times over the years.\nOn to Slide 21, where you can see that our focus on customer affordability continues. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies, coupled with our customer growth efforts, have continued to deliver very affordable bills as a percentage of household income for most of our customers. Our customers' bills are currently on average in the range of $45 to $65 per month.\nAs we grow our footprint, we are continuously looking at ways to improve our operating efficiencies as we work hard to limit bill increases over time. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate. As you can see on the slide, there were multiple pieces of legislation enacted last year that we believe will benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges.\nLet me highlight just 3. First, in New Jersey, the state's Water Quality Accountability Act was strengthened last year. The enhancements include additional enforcement requirements for reporting data, stronger cybersecurity requirements and asset management plans and requirements for the sale of systems with prolonged violations. Given the national news on cyber threats to our infrastructure, we saw this legislation as an important step taken by the state of New Jersey.\nSimilar legislation also exists in Indiana and Missouri, and we continue to see other states consider bills that set operational standards for all water utilities. Second, we saw fair market value legislation enacted in more states. This important tool for community is now exists in 12 of the states where we operate.\nFinally, the bipartisan infrastructure package became law and we are currently working at the state level to identify projects where we can use low interest financing made available through an increase in state revolving funds. The savings made possible by these state revolving funds are passed directly to our customers. Meaning we can invest more with less impact to bills.\nI also want to note that in addition to our historical customer assistance programs, our states are implementing programs that were funded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. In Pennsylvania alone, we have distributed nearly $750,000 to customers in need in the first 5 weeks of the new program. It's a great program and 1 that we hope continues.\nWe are already engaging in 22 legislative efforts at both the state and federal level as many sessions are underway. Turning to Slide 23 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle. I want to start by talking about our sharpened focus on our acquisition strategies. We're very focused on growing in states where we can leverage our competitive advantages.\nFor us, this means a few things. We target acquisitions in the range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers where we have constructive regulatory environments and existing footprint and critical mass. This critical mass is not only helpful to promote customer affordability and cost efficiencies. But as we grow in each state, we will have a greater voice to help solve industry challenges through the legislative and regulatory policies. We also have ample opportunities for wastewater acquisitions where we have an existing water service footprint.\nNow that we've covered the strategies, let's turn to Slide 24 to look at our 2021 results and our expectations for 2022. While we were pleased to welcome 20,000 new customers across 6 states in 2021, our $135 million of acquisitions was short of our planned target for the year. Some of this was due to COVID as municipalities maintained a cautious approach to evaluating possible solutions for their systems needs in light of potential federal assistance. That said, we are starting this year with about 77,000 customer connections under agreement, which is a very strong number. This includes 74,000 customer connections under agreement as of December 31, of which approximately 45,000 are New York, Pennsylvania, which we expect to close in the second quarter of this year.\nIt also includes 25 more signed agreements from 2021 for acquisitions representing 29,000 customer connections as well as another 3,500 signed in the first 6 weeks of 2022. Of those agreements, Egg Harbor City is the first sale under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act and represents about 3,000 customer connections that we expect to close mid to late year.\nImportantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future. You'll see on the slide, we also had bids accepted representing over 11,000 customers in 5 states at the end of 2021. The bids accepted phase is part of the pathway to acquisition, falling between the pipeline of opportunities and the under agreement phase. In total, our goal is $500 million of acquisitions in 2022, including New York.\nWe also have multiple unique opportunities with communities that recognize our competitive advantages. We have great teams in place with great solutions to offer many communities. Combined with our infrastructure investments, we're very confident that we can meet our goal of $2.5 billion of regulated investments in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 25. Our Military Services Group or MSG, complete our growth triangle and remains an important part of our business. This regulated-like business focuses on serving military installations across the country through 50-year operating contracts and then optimizing revenues on those installations beyond the base contract.\nWe currently serve 17 installations and are actively bidding on 3 additional projects, including Naval Station, Mayport in Florida, which we expect will announce the winning bidder the summer. The other 2 active bids are expected to be awarded in 2023. Beyond these 3, there could be nearly 70 other opportunities in the years ahead. The majority of which we think we can win based on our successful track record and our growing expertise in the business.\nI'll now turn it back over to Susan for some closing remarks. Susan?\n\nM. Susan Hardwick\n\nPresident, CEO, CFO & Director, American Water Works Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cheryl. Turning to our final slide, Slide 27. And before we begin Q&A, I want to reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call today. I am confident in the plan that we have in place to grow this business, and I'm confident we have the right teams in place throughout our states at the bases we serve and here in our corporate office to achieve our goals in 2022 and beyond.\nOur team has consistently delivered on our earnings and dividend growth goals year-over-year. Nothing has changed regarding our team's ability and determination to continue that record of execution. We have, without question, consistently raised the bar in the water and wastewater industry for standards of operating excellence, ESG leadership and financial performance as evidenced in part by our exceptional 5-year total shareholder return of 185%.\nThat's why we're reaffirming the long-term targets we initiated last November. And with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have for us."

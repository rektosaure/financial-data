Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third-quarter results, including another quarter of balanced sales growth as well as strong earnings results that significantly exceeded our expectations. I want to thank our team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, communities, and each other. Our mission of serving others informs everything we do at Dollar General, and our efforts are resonating with customers as we continue to enhance our value and convenience proposition. For today's call, I'll begin by recapping some of the highlights of our third-quarter performance, as well as sharing our latest observations on the consumer environment. After that, Donny will share the details of our financial performance, as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2025.\nI'll then wrap up the call with an update on some of our key growth-driving initiatives, including our real estate plans for 2026. Turning to our third-quarter performance, net sales increased 4.6% to $10.6 billion in Q3, compared to net sales of $10.2 billion in last year's third quarter. We grew market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales once again during the quarter, in addition to growing market share in non-consumable product sales. This market share growth is a testament to our improved execution, compelling offering, and broadening appeal with a wide range of customers. Same-store sales increased 2.5% during the quarter, driven by customer traffic. The average basket size essentially was flat. Within the basket, an increase in average unit retail price per item was offset by fewer items on average.\nThis traffic and basket composition is consistent with what we have historically observed when our core customer feels more pressured on their spending, as they come in more often but have smaller basket sizes. For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered broad-based category sales growth with positive comp sales in each of our consumables, seasonal, home, and apparel categories. Notably, the comp sales increase in non-consumable sales once again outpaced a solid increase in consumable sales. From a monthly cadence perspective, all three periods were positive, led by August. September was the softest period of the quarter, as we lapped significant hurricane activity in the prior year before rebounding to higher levels in the month of October. Despite the delay in SNAP payments in early November, we are pleased with our strong sales performance to begin Q4.\nOverall, we are pleased with our top-line results in Q3, which we believe demonstrate the important role we play in providing value to customers in our communities. To that end, we're pleased to see growth once again in our total customer count, with this proportion of growth coming from higher-income households. We remain focused on executing our proven playbook to retain a substantial portion of these customers, and with our unique combination of value and convenience, we believe we are well-positioned to increase market share with customers across all income brackets. With that in mind, we continue to be pleased with our pricing position, which remains within our targeted range of three to four percentage points on average for mass retailers.\nWe also continue to see a substantial offering of more than 2,000 SKUs at or below the $1 price point as an important component of the value offering for our customers. For example, our Value Valley offering, which is comprised of more than 500 rotating SKUs at the $1 price point, was once again our strongest-performing sets in the quarter, with same-store sales growth of 7.6%. With nearly 21,000 stores located within five miles of 75% of the US population, along with a robust and growing digital presence, we are proud of our unique position as America's Neighborhood General Store. We remain committed to serving our customers with low prices they expect on the products they need, and as we help them save time and money every day. Overall, we're proud of our Q3 results and the significant progress we've made this year improving our operating and financial performance.\nAs we continue to invest in the growth and development of our teams, we are seeing lower year-over-year turnover in all levels of our in-store positions, which is also contributing to our improved execution and financial results. The progress we've made further supports our confidence in our long-term financial framework, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. Before I turn the call over for our financial update, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate Emily Taylor on her promotion to Chief Operating Officer. During her time at Dollar General, she has been a strong leader who has consistently enhanced the customer experience both in-store and through our innovative digital offerings. She and her teams have elevated the Dollar General and pOpshelf brands while also improving operational efficiency, and we are excited to expand her responsibilities moving forward.\nI'm confident she is the right leader for this position and look forward to working with her in this new role. I'm also excited to welcome Donny Lau as our new CFO. We are thrilled to have him back at Dollar General and look forward to working with him to further accelerate our progress and drive sustainable growth over the long term. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Don.\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. After almost two and a half years away, I'm excited to be back at Dollar General, and I look forward to connecting with many of you in the months ahead. While I've only been back a short time, it's clear there are substantial opportunities for growth and value creation. I'm especially excited about the progress we're making against key initiatives, which is contributing to strong operational and financial results. I look forward to working with the team to advance our strategic priorities as we look to build on our momentum, drive long-term sustainable growth, and deliver strong returns on invested capital. I'll now cover our Q3 results. Since Todd has taken you through the top-line results for the quarter, my comments will cover some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year.\nAll references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.9%, an increase of 107 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory markups and lower shrink, partially offset by an increased LIFO provision. Our ongoing efforts to reduce shrink once again contributed to strong operating margin expansion in Q3, as we delivered a 90 basis point improvement in shrink versus prior year. Notably, shrink continues to improve at a much higher and faster rate compared to the expectations contemplated in our long-term financial framework, and we expect continued improvement over time. Turning to SG&A, which, as a percentage of sales, was 25.9%, an increase of 25 basis points.\nThe primary expenses that were a higher percentage of sales in Q3 include incentive compensation, repairs and maintenance, and utilities, partially offset by a decrease in hurricane-related costs. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for Q3 increased 31.5% to $425.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit increased 82 basis points to 4%. Net interest expense for Q3 decreased to $55.9 million compared to $67.8 million in last year's Q3. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 23.6% and compares to 23.2% in the prior year. Finally, EPS for Q3 increased 43.8% to $1.28, which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have made significant progress in strengthening our financial position.\nMerchandise inventories were $6.7 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of $465 million or 6.5% compared to prior year, and a decrease of 8.2% on an average per-store basis. The team continues to do a terrific job reducing inventory while driving sales and improving in-stock levels. Overall, we're pleased with our inventory position as we enter this important holiday shopping season. Importantly, we believe there is opportunity to further reduce and optimize our inventory position, and we expect continued progress as we move ahead. Year-to-date through Q3, we generated significant cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion, which represents an increase of 28%. As previously communicated, we redeemed $600 million of senior notes during the quarter, well ahead of their scheduled April 2027 maturity, further strengthening our balance sheet and reducing future interest expense.\nWe also paid a dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding during the quarter for a total payment of approximately $130 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in the business, including our existing store base, as well as other high-return growth opportunities such as new store expansion, remodels, and other strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and, when appropriate, share repurchases. While our leverage ratio remains above our goal of less than three times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA, we are making significant progress towards reaching our target level in support of our commitment to middle BBB ratings by S&P and Moody's. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2025.\nOur update primarily reflects our Q3 outperformance and improved outlook for Q4, while also considering the potential for continued uncertainty, particularly in consumer behavior. With that in mind, we now expect the following for 2025: net sales growth of approximately 4.7% to 4.9%, same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5% to 2.7%, and EPS in the range of $6.30 to $6.50. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and that we will not repurchase shares under the existing share repurchase program. Now, I want to provide some additional context around our expectations. With regards to gross margin, we anticipate shrink will be a continued tailwind in Q4, though to a much lesser extent than Q3, as we begin to lap the improvements we made toward the end of last year.\nWe also now expect capital spending to be towards the low end of our previously stated range of $1.3 to 1.4 billion. This includes our continued expectations to execute approximately 4,885 real estate projects in 2025, including 575 new store openings in the United States and up to 15 in Mexico, 2,000 Project Renovate remodels, 2,250 Project Elevate remodels, and 45 relocations. Finally, as a result of our strong cash and liquidity position, we plan to redeem an additional $550 million of our senior notes earlier than their November 2027 maturity. Our guidance contemplates about $9 million of incremental expense in Q4 in connection with this repayment. In closing, we are pleased with our third-quarter result and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2025.\nWhile we plan to speak more to our 2026 outlook on our Q4 call in March, we are confident in our long-term financial framework, and we are very pleased to be ahead of schedule in our progress. Importantly, we are working to further strengthen and accelerate, where we see opportunity, our path to achieving these goals. We look forward to sharing our continued progress as we move ahead. Overall, we are confident in our business model and remain focused on delivering profitable sales growth, high returns on invested capital, strong operating cash flow, and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Donny. I'll take the next few minutes to provide updates on three of our most important initiatives as we look to further advance our progress toward achieving our short and long-term goals. Starting with real estate, where we continue to enhance and extend our unique combination of value and convenience to new communities across the country. These efforts remain focused on driving sales and market share growth by expanding our unique real estate footprint while also enhancing our mature store base. We opened 196 new stores in Q3, primarily in our 8,500 sq ft store format in rural markets. Importantly, we continue to accelerate our efforts and, through the first 10 periods of the year, have substantially completed our planned new store openings for fiscal 2025.\nOutside the US, we've opened seven new stores in Mexico this year, bringing us to a total of 15 at the end of Q3. We continue to test and learn in these stores and remain excited about the opportunity to serve these communities. We also continue to make substantial progress with our remodel initiatives. As a reminder, in addition to our traditional remodel program, which we call Project Renovate, we previously introduced a new incremental remodel program called Project Elevate. This initiative is designed to further grow sales and market share in portions of our mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of our full remodel pipeline. These projects include physical asset investments, as well as merchandising optimization, product adjacency adjustments, and category refreshes, all of which impacts approximately 80% of the total store.\nWe completed 651 Project Elevate remodels in Q3 and an additional 524 Project Renovate remodels during the quarter. While we have not yet reached the one-year anniversary of the first stores in the program, we are on track to deliver an average first-year annualized sales comp lift of approximately 3% in Project Elevate stores, and we continue to expect comp sales lifts of approximately 6% for Project Renovate stores. Importantly, we continue to see significant improvements in customer satisfaction in these stores upon completion of the remodels. These results have given us confidence to make Project Elevate a key component of our real estate strategy as we move forward. Looking ahead to 2026, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America, where approximately 80% of our current store base serves towns of 20,000 or fewer people.\nWe plan to build on that strength in 2026 with plans to execute approximately 4,730 real estate projects in total, including 450 new store openings in the US, 2,000 Project Renovate remodels, and 2,250 Project Elevate remodels, and 20 relocations. We plan to open approximately 10 additional stores in Mexico. With regards to new stores, as a reminder, we monitor several metrics of our portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations, new store productivity compared to our mature store base, cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable, cash payback, which we expect in approximately two years, and a new store return, which we expect to be in the range of approximately 16% to 17% on average in 2026. Overall, our new store projects continue to deliver healthy returns despite higher occupancy and operating costs.\nImportantly, we're committed to mitigating these cost pressures where possible and continue to see significant runway for new store expansion, with approximately 11,000 opportunities for Dollar General stores in the US. While we've always said that for a variety of reasons, we don't expect to capture every opportunity, we're excited about our ability to significantly grow our footprint in the years to come. We anticipate that the majority of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 sq ft formats and will be predominantly in rural communities. Nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 sq ft stores. As a reminder, these larger footprint stores provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings and more health and beauty products.\nWhile we currently offer fresh produce in approximately 7,000 stores, we anticipate bringing this offering to more than 200 additional stores in 2026. We are excited about our real estate plans for next year and believe these projects will continue to deepen our connection with our current customers while better positioning us to attract new customers as well. Collectively, we believe these projects will further solidify Dollar General as the essential partner in communities in rural America, both in our physical store locations as well as with an expanding digital reach, all while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth. The next area I want to discuss is our digital initiative, which serves as an important complement to our expansive store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers.\nOur digital capabilities include an engaging mobile app and website that continues to be very popular with our customers and have expanded our delivery capabilities while growing our DG Media Network. We have significantly expanded the reach of our delivery options available to customers. Our DoorDash partnership, which now services more than 18,000 stores, continues to drive significant incrementality and sales growth. As a reminder, we partnered with DoorDash to launch our own same-day delivery offering through our Dollar General digital solutions late last year. We believe DG Delivery can drive great customer loyalty within our digital platform while ultimately accelerating growth and increasing market share. We significantly increased the penetration of this offering in Q3, and now DG Delivery is available through our app and website in more than 17,000 stores.\nMost recently, we entered a partnership with Uber Eats to further expand the reach of our delivery capabilities as we provide value and convenience to customers on their platform. We are now live in more than 17,000 stores with Uber as well. Collectively, these delivery options have significantly enhanced the convenience proposition for our customers, with more than 75% of our orders delivered in one hour or less, while also extending our value offering to a wide range of new customers. We are seeing larger basket sizes than the average in-store transaction and a very strong repeat visit rate from customers on our delivery platforms. Looking ahead, we have ample opportunity to further drive incremental sales growth through a variety of customer experience enhancements and increase customer awareness.\nAs we see continued growth in our digital properties, one of the most significant components of our digital initiative is our DG Media Network, which enables a more personalized experience for our unique customer base while delivering a higher return on ad spend for our partners. We are continuing to drive significant year-over-year growth in retail media volume as partners seek to access our unique customer base. Our digital advertising business continues to see double-digit growth in 2025, driven by new DG Media Network capabilities on our site and within our app. We believe we are still in the early stages of the potential financial contribution from this initiative. The DG Media Network remains an important contributor to our long-term growth framework, and we're excited about its potential.\nOver time, we believe we can leverage our digital initiative to increase market share and drive profitable sales growth while further evolving our relationship with our customers and driving greater customer loyalty within the digital platform. The final initiative I want to discuss is our non-consumable growth strategy. As a reminder, we are focused on a few key drivers in our non-consumable categories over the next three years. These include brand partnerships, a revamped treasure hunt experience, and reallocation of space within our home category. During Q3, we were pleased to deliver positive same-store sales growth in each of our three non-consumable categories for the third consecutive quarter. This growth was led by our two largest non-consumable categories, seasonal and home, each of which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 4% in the quarter. Our pOpshelf stores delivered another quarter of strong same-store sales growth in Q3.\nOur new store layout continues to perform well, and we continue to take lessons from pOpshelf and apply them to our non-consumable approach in our Dollar General stores as we further enhance that offering for customers. We believe our non-consumable sales growth, both in Dollar General and pOpshelf stores, continues to benefit from improved execution and a more compelling assortment, as well as from the expanded trade-in shopping we've seen from higher-income customers. These results, including multiple quarters of strong sales performance and market share gains, continue to demonstrate that our treasure hunt approach is resonating with customers. Furthermore, our focus on value continues to guide our efforts and drive our success in these categories.\nWith approximately 20% of our holiday sets priced at $1 and more than 70% at $3 or below, we are excited about our ability to serve customers across all income brackets during this important time of the year. In turn, we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving sales and market share growth in these categories while also further increasing our gross margin. In closing, I want to reiterate that we're pleased with our performance, proud of our progress, and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us at Dollar General. We are laser-focused on furthering these efforts and accelerating our progress toward our goals over the short and long term. As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our approximately 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\nWith that, Operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to be placed into the question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, then return to the queue. Our first question is coming from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Welcome back, Donny. I have a two-part question just on gross margin. For Q4, it would be helpful to understand some of the puts and takes there you see on the gross margin line.\nAnd then from a longer-term perspective, we've seen significant progress this year on the gross margin front, including shrink. Just curious about the overall confidence in being able to deliver the next round of improvement, whether it's from retail media, mixshifts, etc., and on the damages front.\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah, maybe I'll kick it off and then hand off the second part of your question to Todd. But thanks, Rupesh. Good to connect with you again. Yeah, maybe I'll just start with Q3 gross margin. I'm especially pleased, right, that we delivered 107 basis points of expansion in Q3, and that's on top of 137 basis points in Q2. And from a Q3 perspective, that's also despite 79 basis points headwind from LIFO.\nWhile we're very pleased to see continued benefit from some of our other key focus areas like lower damages, reduction in markdowns, and some of the other initiatives that Todd's going to speak about, I think the outperformance and shrink was notable during the quarter. The way I think about it, Rupesh, is we're really building momentum on our key initiatives, and the team's really doing a nice job in terms of balancing price and managing mix. In terms of Q4, we do expect another quarter of gross margin expansion. In Q4, we expect to see continued improvement and shrink, as those I alluded to on the prepared remarks, to a lesser extent versus Q3. That's because we really are lapping outsized or more improvement in Q4 of 2024 to the tune of about 68 basis points.\nWe'll also be lapping a discrete item from the prior year really associated with the optimization of our portfolio. We also expect continued benefit from growth in private label, and non-consumables and continued improvement in damages, as well as supply chain efficiencies. The one headwind I will note is just LIFO, although we do expect to partially offset that with price and through continued managing mix as well. So again, overall, on the gross margin line, I'd say I believe there's more tailwinds than headwinds, which is nice to see and feel really good about the momentum we're seeing and building on this front.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah, Rupesh, thanks for the question as well. As I think about the long-term gross margin opportunities, I feel very good.\nActually, our shrink improvement so far has actually given us, myself and our team here, even more confidence in delivering on that long-term model in our gross margin line. If you think about it, when I think about where we're at today with shrink, as Donny indicated, the great thing about our shrink benefits so far is while we did take self-checkout out, which has been a nice contributor, the stores that never had self-checkout, about 6,500 of them, have seen very substantial increases, or I should say decreases, in shrink and increases in gross margin. So what that does, it gives us a lot of confidence that there's probably more gross margin opportunities than we even thought in that long-term model. So stay tuned for that as we go forward. And then, as Donny indicated, boy, we still have a lot of great opportunities ahead.\nWhen you think of damages, we're just starting that journey. We've seen some nice damage clawbacks over the last couple of quarters, but we see even more without giving you any guidance for 2026 yet, even more as we move into next year and beyond. So stay tuned there. I think you'll see us execute against that very similarly how we executed very strong against our shrink initiatives. And then lastly, mix and media network mix continues to be a good guy and will continue to be. All of the work the team has done, the merchants, our operators, and our supply chain on our non-consumable initiatives really has moved the mix number for us. And as you know, those hold a lot stronger gross margins, not only in our home, seasonal, and apparel categories, but also our HBA categories, which have outsized gross margins.\nSo feel very good about the long-term prospects of that. And then lastly, our media network, we're in the second inning. We're just starting the media network piece. And I would tell you that we're off to a great start. Double-digit increases again this quarter. And as I look out to the long-term model, we see a lot of opportunity there as well. So stay tuned. We feel strong. We feel good about where we are and very good about that long-term model.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Zhihan Ma from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you for taking my question. As a two-part question on real estate, so a short-term one, I think, Paul, you mentioned that the remodels are generating about like a 3% to 6% sales lift, which I believe are at the lower end of the previous ranges you've given.\nSo can you just talk about, is there additional upside? What are some of the near-term dynamics you're seeing there? And then longer-term, given some of the changes in your competitive landscape with Family Dollar no longer really in the picture, drug stores closing, how does that change your view on your real estate opportunities and the growth rate you're willing to pursue? Thank you.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah, sure. We're really happy with the remodel program. As you know, we really are just in year one. We haven't even cycled a full year yet of Project Elevate. And that's given us what we've seen so far has given us a lot of confidence. Matter of fact, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're going to do another 2,250 of those next year. So hitting right around 3% right now, but we're just getting started.\nSo as we look to even enhance this program as we go into next year, we'll continue to look at ways to ensure we even get a better comp out of it. But 3% is very strong and is well within our guidance and our guidelines here to continue to move forward. It's a strong, strong return at 3%. And then on Project Renovate at 6%, again, we're just getting going good there. We've been doing, obviously, these projects for many, many years. As we continue to rationalize our SKU base, our coolers, we see real opportunity to continue to drive long-term sales growth in these, albeit probably closer to 6% than the 8% that we had seen in the past. But again, I'll take a 6% comp any day of the week with the investments that we're putting forward on these.\nSo again, gives us a lot of confidence to do another 2,000 of those next year. So really feel good about each of those. But we're retailers. We're never satisfied with the comps that we put out, and we're going to continue to push even harder. And then long-term, on your second part of the question, I would tell you we still feel very good. We got 11,000 opportunities in the continental United States to put a Dollar General store in. Obviously, as we said, we won't get all those. But your question pointed to the reason we're bullish on getting a lot of these is that our competition today is really not opening a lot of stores. And for that, we don't feel compelled to have to rush to open a lot of stores.\nSo we believe that the right mix right now, 450 stores, still very strong for the year. The right mix of remodel and new, we believe, is the right thing. Taking care of that mature store base as we go forward is also strong. But with still close to 17% returns on new stores, we feel very bullish about what the future looks like with that 11,000 opportunities. And when we feel it's appropriate, we have the opportunity and the capacity to step it up from there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. And congrats on a nice quarter. So maybe two-part questions. Todd, first, how would you assess current health of your low to middle-income customer, maybe leveraging your latest survey work? And what's the traffic versus basket interplay that you've historically seen in similar economic backdrops?\nAnd then for Donny, if you could maybe just touch on any puts and takes to consider as it relates to next year, just relative to the target to return earnings growth to 10% at 2% to 3% comps and tying in the moderated real estate plan for next year.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nOkay. Matt, yeah, thank you. I'll start out. Yeah. As we exited Q3, I would tell you that that low, middle, and consumer continues to be stretched. She is definitely being very mindful of where she shops and what she shops for, making trade-off at the shelf in many instances. The great thing about Dollar General is that we offer extreme value here with a very convenient place to shop. And that is obviously resonating with the consumer with a 2.5% comp for the quarter.\nI believe, most notably, much different, by the way, than our competitors have put out there, a 2.5% traffic number. If you think about it, when you think about traffic, we've always said here, traffic is the real measuring point, right? Because that's the sustainability of the comp as we go forward. We can leverage that additional traffic that we're seeing into long-term sustainable growth here at Dollar General. Stay tuned for that. We know how to also go after these customers. We've already started that retention program to ensure that we continue to keep the customer, the new ones that we're seeing, into the brand, both from the middle and the high end.\nAnd then lastly, on that low-end consumer, when you think about where we sit in price, we feel very good about our everyday price, very good positioning there, a solid and balanced promotional cadence, which is always important for that low-end consumer. But the most important that she continues to tell us through our survey work, Matt, is that we've got over 2,000 SKUs at a dollar or less every day inside of our stores. And matter of fact, the team did a great job this year leveraging that low-end consumer work with our holiday performance. And as you think about holiday this year, we have 20% of our SKUs are at a dollar. We have 70% of the entire mix of holiday at $3 or less. So it's going to resonate pretty well. And I will tell you that we're off to a very nice start here in Q4.\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYep. And then in terms of your question on 2026 and long-term framework, Matt, we'll plan to provide more formal guidance on our Q4 earnings call in March. But overall, based on where I sit today, I do think it's fair to say that we're tracking towards the timelines contemplated in our long-term financial framework. And if you just take a step back at a high level, we all feel really good about our ability to deliver against the long-term financial framework targets. I'm especially excited about the progress we're already making against some of the key targets. And so the way I think about it, Matt, is given all the great work the team's accomplished around our back-to-basic strategy, we've essentially stabilized the core, right? And the business is once again on really strong footing.\nObviously, a lot of work to do still, particularly around sustainability, but we're now able to execute better against certain what I call value drivers. The great news is we're making great progress across many of these drivers. I think that was reflected in our strong Q3 operational and financial results. So when you add it all up to me, we really are building momentum across many aspects of the business. We're ahead of schedule versus some of our initial targets that we laid out. We'll continue to accelerate where we see opportunity. Overall, I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic as we move ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Seth Sigman from Barclays. He's now live.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. My question is on digital and the incrementality that you mentioned.\nCan you talk about the value proposition? What is appealing about your offering for the consumer for delivery today? And if you can, maybe frame the contribution to total comps growth from delivery. How is that starting to help? And then just taking a step back, how does this change the economics of the business over time? Obviously, it's an important part of the long-term margin story. And so I think it'd be helpful to sort of lay that out. Thanks so much.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll take the first part. I'll let Donny talk briefly on the economics. But Seth, we're very proud of where we are on our end in our digital journey. Again, as we talked about our media network being in the very early innings, the second inning, I would tell you our digital journey in totality is probably just in the second inning.\nSo we're really just starting our journey. But I would tell you that we're off to a really nice start. It was a very nice contributor again this quarter. But as I step back and think about our digital piece and what it looks like, when you think about the proposition for our core customer and, quite frankly, for the customer just in general, what we're seeing early on is still very high incrementality rates of shoppers in the digital program. Over 70% incrementality is on how we're measuring it, which is a very, very strong piece. Getting new customers, we're seeing much larger basket sizes through our digital properties, which really does, again, show that it's a different type of customer than our core.\nBut also that we're starting to see more signs of a stock up versus what we normally see inside of our brick and mortar of a fill-in. So we feel good about that incrementality piece, good about the extra piece. Our real opportunity here is to continue to deliver to rural America. I think that's our value proposition at this point. And I believe we are off to a great start there. And by the way, we have a unique opportunity. We own rural America out there across the United States. And today, even in the second inning that we're in, over 70% of our orders that are done are delivered to an individual's front door in an hour or less, even in rural America. And that is a strong proposition that no one's been able to touch.\nWe'll continue to foster that and look at ways to even gain momentum across those properties.\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYep. And as Todd alluded to, we're especially pleased with the incrementality. I think the other way to think about that is we're introducing new customers to the Dollar General brand, right? And the great news is, as they engage with us, they engage more across our digital properties, right, which makes the DG Media Network even more attractive to our brand partners, which is fantastic. And so what I'm really excited about is we're seeing good growth here. It is sales, profit, and creative, which is obviously fantastic to see.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS through lines now live. Good morning.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you so much for taking my question. Donny, welcome back. My question is on the comp.\nYou've now settled into a few quarters in a row of 2% comps. Is this as good as it's going to get? And does it provide enough margin of safety looking forward to next year when SNAP could become a headwind, and other factors are going to be at play in the overall environment? If that's the case, might you have to become more promotional, do more things like offer $5 off a $25 basket in order to drive the comp, and you'll have to sacrifice some margin in order to drive the top line? Thank you very much.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Michael. I'll start it out and have Donnie wrap that up. But we feel great about the 2.5% comp. As I indicated in an earlier question, the comp was strong at 2.5. We've been well over 2 now, a few quarters in a row.\nAs I think about Q4, we feel very good about the numbers we put out for full-year guidance that would also portray a stronger comp in Q4. As I think about the comp, the composition is so important, Michael. You know that. You've been with us on this journey for quite a while now, many years. Anytime we can turn a 2.5% comp into a 2.5% ticket, I'm sorry, traffic number, that is a very strong showing. It bodes well for what the future holds in comp. We're retailers. We're never satisfied with where we are. I would tell you that we strive to turn even higher numbers. The great thing about how I look at this business is that we always look for sustainability, not a quick win on the comp side.\nI believe that's how we've put this together and what we're seeing as we go forward. Then lastly, I would also tell you that from a promotional cadence perspective and what we see in the future, we believe we're uniquely positioned today and rightfully positioned. We don't see that changing, at least in the near term. In the next year, we don't see a need to be more promotional. We think the way we have approached this with a great everyday price, a good balance of promotional cadence opportunities that we already have in place. And again, that very, very important $1 price point that we continue to offer the consumer puts us in a real unique position to drive comps.\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. And the only thing I'd add too, Michael, is we have a lot of confidence, right?\nIn the 2% to 3% growth over the time period that we've outlined in the long-term framework. I think the great news is we're able to deliver against our long-term framework targets within this range. I think the other thing to point out is new stores and the remodels; they're expected to contribute about 150 to 200 basis points of that comp, right? Then on top of that, you layer in the growth we're seeing in new customers, trade-in, higher income, and the playbook we have to retain them. I'll tell you, overall, we feel really good about our plans to build on our sales momentum, balance of year and beyond. Then we touched on this earlier too, but on the margin line, overall, I'll tell you, I think we have more tailwinds and headwinds as we move into 2026 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, everyone. Hi, Todd. Donny. My question is on getting back to 6% plus margins. Can you think about the construct? Should there be linearity to it? It sounds like retail media will be a big piece of it, but maybe not in the immediate year or so, or is that the wrong way to think about it?\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll let Todd touch a little bit more on the media network. I think we touched on it earlier. But at a high level on the margin side, Simeon, I'll tell you, I feel really good here also in terms of our ability to deliver against that margin target.\nWe touched on this a little bit, but there are a lot of drivers we have in place that we expect will contribute to margin expansion over time. I do want to note that while the focus is on the op margin line, right, gross profit obviously is expected to be the more meaningful contributor to margin expansion over this time period. Within gross margin, we do continue to expect shrink and damages will contribute at least, right, 120 basis points expansion. We talked about this, but the great news is shrink is already improving at a faster and higher rate than we were initially anticipating. A lot of reasons to think we can deliver continued improvement over time on that front. In terms of damages, right, they're trending in line with our expectations. Overall, really pleased with that progress.\nOn the DG Media Network, as Todd alluded to, kind of early days, we do think it's going to be a meaningful contributor over time. The great news is we're just beginning to really build momentum against our initiative here. And just remember, there's a lot of other drivers in place that we expect to contribute as well, whether it's further reductions in kind of markdown risk, and greater efficiencies across the supply chain, continued growth in the non-consumables business. We're seeing good growth coming out of private brands. And so overall, I'd tell you, I just feel really good about our ability to drive continued gross margin expansion as we move ahead.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. And Simeon, I would tell you that, as we do believe, the media network, as we go into the outer years of our long-term framework, will be a substantial contributor.\nAnd the reason that we feel that way is we already are seeing nice large double-digit gains quarter over quarter or year over year. And I would tell you that as we pick up momentum on our native myDG digital platform, as those start to grow even more, what we start to see there is more first-party accounts, which then translates, and we're able to monetize that with our vendor partners. They see a lot of value in that because, again, uniquely positioned here because we own the data for lower-end to middle-end consumers in rural America, where it is very difficult, if not almost impossible, for anyone else to have replicated what we know about that customer and then how we monetize that over the long term.\nAnd for us, we believe that uniquely positions us to be able to deliver on that long-term framework as it relates to the media network.\n\nDonny Lau\n\nCFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYep. And then just quickly too, Simeon, just because we haven't really touched on this, but in terms of SG&A, just as a reminder, the goal here is to really minimize the deleverage. And I think we're really well positioned to deliver against this target as well. Just briefly, as a reminder for this year, we do expect outsized incentive comp of approximately $200 million this year. So that should benefit next year as we, I think it's fair to expect for us to plan for a more normalized rate there. But in addition, the accelerated remodel program is expected to mitigate future SG&A expense. In the meantime, we do expect to drive additional efficiencies through more work simplification efforts.\nAnd so overall, we feel really good about our efforts on the SG&A front as well. And the one thing we really haven't spoken about at all is really AI, right? And I do think this provides a potential opportunity to maybe drive greater efficiencies and more sales as we move ahead. In fact, we recently hired a new head of AI to accelerate our efforts here. And in the meantime, in the background, we are laying the foundation to enable AI at scale, right, with our IT modernization efforts. And importantly, what I would say is these additional efficiencies and potential opportunities for more sales growth that are associated with AI aren't captured in the framework today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners",
    "content2": "Hey, Todd, two related questions.\nWhere do you think the greatest opportunity is on labor productivity? Because I don't think financially electronic shelf labels work in the dollar store setting. Or correct me if I'm wrong with that. Then secondly, do you think you can get shrink down to 1% or so without adversely impacting sales? There has to be a natural floor that you don't want to go below.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. John, thanks for the questions. Yeah. I would tell you, I'll start when you think about the shrink numbers. We feel good about where we're headed here. We had set our sights on around the 2019 levels of shrink. We felt really good about that. We are recalibrating to a better number because we're seeing even more opportunity.\nI think you're leaning toward, and I think importantly for me to point out is that our SKU rationalization efforts have really produced some of this outsized shrink opportunity on the good side that we've seen so far. And it should be the gift that keeps on giving because we believe that as we move into 2026, and stay tuned as we talk about 2026 when we come out with our fourth quarter results. But rest assured that SKU rationalization, and just inventory in totality will still be very top of mind in 2026. And with that, we believe that there's opportunity for even lower shrink numbers as we go forward. That's why I mentioned earlier that I feel that in that long-term framework, we can benefit probably from even better shrink than we had first anticipated.\nAnd if nothing else gives us great assurances that we can deliver on that long-term framework. But stay tuned. A lot of time, a lot of time ahead of us, but we feel good about that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for the time. And Todd, I think you started to touch a little bit on this, but you've had almost two straight years of inventory declines. Obviously, there's a major working capital benefit. But I have a two-part question. One, can you guys size the positive margin impact that the lower inventory levels have had on both markdown activity and shrink? And then two, at what point do you need to start rebuilding your inventory levels? Thanks.\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll take that. We're not going to quantify, but I would tell you that what we've seen is, and you mentioned it, we've intentionally gone out with skew reduction. We've reduced over 2,500 everyday SKUs over the past couple of years. We've got more to go. And I would tell you that any good retailer does this over time. We don't believe there's a need to rebuild current inventory levels. We believe we're in many categories at optimal levels, but we also believe there's a lot of categories that we can still optimize. And that's what we'll be going after in 2026 and beyond. So stay tuned and should benefit us on the shrink line and, most importantly, on the damage line as we go forward. The great thing I think we can all agree upon at this point is all those efforts have not hit us on the top line.\nAs a matter of fact, we've continued to produce fill rates that are at some of our highest levels that we've seen in years here for the consumer. And obviously, you see the two and a half comp this quarter and the traffic number. And that traffic number is a real good indication that she has a lot of confidence to continue to come into Dollar General and find what she needs. So we feel good about where we are. We don't believe for a moment that we're finished and more to come. We think that it's a real opportunity for us and a strong opportunity on that gross margin line, probably even more so as Donny indicated than we even at first contemplated in that long-term model.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Equity Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, Todd. Welcome back, Donny.\nI have two questions. One near term, one long term. On the near term, Todd, can you just amplify on the strong start to November and the more positive outlook for the fourth quarter? How much of that's traffic-driven? Have you seen any improvement in ticket? And then longer term, there's a lot of concerns out there about Amazon and Walmart+. Can you talk about some of the key tenets of your competitive moat in the rural landscape and how you can compete more effectively?\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah. Yeah, Chuck, thanks for the question. Yeah, I would tell you, while we're not going to give you a ton of color on Q4, I would tell you we are off to a good start, a great start, quite frankly. Feel very good about that.\nEven in the face of some of those SNAP benefit holdbacks due to the government shutdown, I'll give you a little color around that, which I think is important because SNAP, as we go into next year, may have some headwinds to it, but we still see OB3 as a complete in totality a tailwind for us. Here's one reason on the SNAP side: what we saw was the consumer still needed to feed her family. She still has to do that. She used cash as a tender with us during the shutdown time where she didn't get her benefit. Then as those benefits flowed in, we also then got the SNAP benefit on the second part of the month. It quite frankly was a net positive for us as we moved through November.\nAnd not only in those areas, but she also bought a lot of the non-consumable categories. And holiday is off to a really good start as well. So feel bullish, but always keep in mind a lot of quarter still left ahead of us with the important Christmas holiday selling season upon us at this point. But we feel, as Donny indicated, we have a fair amount of momentum heading into that holiday season and into next year. And then lastly, your question around our competitive moat, I tell you, we feel good about the competitive moat. We have spent years, Chuck, and many, many dollars, as you know, not only building, but strengthening that competitive moat in rural America.\nWith 80% of our stores in those small towns across America, very, very difficult to replicate, whether it be brick and mortar or whether it be on a digital basis. And again, we didn't sit back. We moved swiftly once we saw that our core consumer was starting to venture into her digital journey. We've always said our core customer, she's a fast follower. She'll get there. And she's starting to move that way. So we move that way. And the great thing is we move that way with a lot of intentionality. And that intentionality was really centered around rural America and being able to deliver that customer an hour or less where no one else can touch that at this point.\nWe feel that's a very strong competitive moat and will continue to do that, but also build on our ability to have a very strong and sustainable brick and mortar business as well as that digital business as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\n\nSpencer Hanus\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to circle back on the remodel program. The updated lists you provided was helpful. I'm just curious what you think the tailwind could be in year two if there's any tailwind coming. And then just in terms of the price gaps, you called out that 3% to 4% gap versus Walmart. Have you seen any change there in how you guys are coming in from a pricing standpoint versus some of these other guys out there?\n\nTodd Vasos\n\nCEO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll take those. I would tell you on the pricing piece that we feel very good about where we are, as I indicated earlier. Not only are our everyday price still falling within the bounds that our core customer looks to us to be able to provide her, but also around those promotional cadence, our TPR program, temporary price reduction program, and our ad program all deliver solidly to our core consumer. It's evident by those traffic numbers that we're seeing. Then lastly, I keep emphasizing this because it is such an important component to the low-end consumer, and that's that dollar price point is so, so important to that consumer. With that, gives her a halo effect on price in totality within the Dollar General organization.\nSo I would tell you that our price perception numbers through what we see in our consumer data is on the increase, while others may not be. We feel very strong about that positioning as we go forward. Then our programs around our new store programs, our remodel programs, we again feel very strong about where we're headed and the long-term possibilities that those hold, including our pOpshelf in Mexico banners. We feel good. We're in test and learn mode on those two, but we're seeing very nice sales gains. The customer is resonating with each of those brands, but more to come there as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We reached the end of our question and answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. Let me disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.\nWe thank you for your participation today."

    "content": "Q2 2025 Dollar General Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2025 Dollar General Corp Earnings Call\n\nDGNYSEAUG 28, 9:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning. My name is Rob, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 28, 2025. [Operator Instructions]\nThis call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].\nNow I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference.\n\nKevin Walker\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and Kelly [indiscernible], our CFO.\nOur earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events. Let me caution you that today's comments include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements about our financial guidance, long-term financial framework, strategy, initiatives, plans, goals, priorities, opportunities, expectations or beliefs about future matters and other statements that are not limited to historical fact. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, those identified in our earnings release issued this morning under Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K filed\n[Audio Gap]\nThe basket growth was driven by an increase in both average unit retail price per item and average items per basket. We were excited to see a second consecutive quarter of broad-based category growth with positive comp sales in each of our consumables, seasonal, home and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, we saw same-store sales growth above 2% in all 3 periods with our strong in June and July. We believe these strong and balanced top line results are a reflection of the hard work the team has done to improve execution and further enhance the value and convenience proposition for both existing and new customers. To that end, we're pleased to see growth with customers across all income brackets during the quarter. This includes our core customer who increased spending despite worsening sentiment. In addition, we continue to see trade-in growth with middle- and higher-income customers during the quarter, which we believe is contributing to the nice performance we've seen in our nonconsumable categories.\nUltimately, customers across all income brackets are coming to Dollar General as they seek value. As America's neighborhood general store in more than 20,000 locations across the country, we recognize and embrace our role in being here for what matters for our customers. This includes providing the items they want and need at prices they can afford. With that in mind, we are committed to delivering everyday low prices that are within 3 to 4 percentage points on average of mass retailers. While we are pleased that we continue to operate within the targeted price range, we are also focused on maintaining our substantial offering of more than 2,000 SKUs at or below the $1 price point.\nWe know this price point is important in helping our core customers stretch their dollar, particularly at the end of the month and when budgets are tight. In fact, our $1 value Valley merchandising set which is comprised of more than 500 rotating SKUs was one of our strongest performing areas in the quarter, with same-store sales growth more than twice the rate of the overall company. We believe this holistic approach to offering value will continue to be important for our customers, particularly in the back half of this year.\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on how we're thinking about tariffs. With the rates currently in place, we believe we will be able to mitigate the vast majority of the impact on our cost of goods. The proactive approach of our sourcing team, coupled with our relatively low direct import exposure has positioned us well to serve our customers with a quality assortment at tremendous value. While the landscape remains dynamic, tariffs have begun to result in some price increases, and we will continue to work to minimize them as much as possible.\nMost importantly, we know this further amplifies the value within our communities, and we remain committed to serving our customers with the everyday low prices they have come to know and appreciating Dollar General. Overall, we're proud of our performance during the quarter and tremendous progress we've made throughout the first half of the year. Our actions are delivering an enhanced shopping experience for our customers and driving strong operating and financial results. We are further strengthening our value and convenient proposition for our customers, while making significant progress on our long-term financial goals.\nBefore I turn the call over for our financial update, I want to thank Kelly for her partnership as well as her leadership of our financial organization over the last few years. We wish her the very best at [indiscernible] and begins for a new chapter. I also want to note that we're able to welcome Don [indiscernible] back to Dollar General as ex-CFO beginning in October. He is highly regarded throughout the organization for his deep understanding of the business thoughtful strategic leadership and appreciation for our culture and values. We look forward to his leadership of our financial organization as we seek to drive excellence create long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, on a personal note, I want to express my appreciation to this team, our customers and our shareholders. This is a special organization with a unique mission, and I'm grateful for the time I've had to serve alongside them. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nFor Q2, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3% and an increase of 137 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to lower shrink, higher inventory markups and lower inventory damages. Our focus on reducing shrink has continued to produce positive results, including a healthy year-over-year improvement of 108 basis points in the second quarter. .\nWe're excited to be outperforming the shrink reduction educations contemplated then our long-term [indiscernible] growth framework in terms of both timing and magnitude. [indiscernible] results. We're optimistic about the potential for shrink reduction to contribute more than 80 basis points toward the operating margin goal of 6 to 7 completed within our long-term financial framework. In addition, we were pleased to drive a reduction in damages in the second quarter as our efforts in this area have begun to take hold as well. The gross margin increase was partially offset by an increased LIFO provision as was increased markdowns and increased distribution costs. Now let's turn to SG&A, which as a percentage of sales, was 25.8%, an increase of 121 basis points. The primary expenses that were a higher percentage of net sales in the quarter were incentive compensation, repairs and maintenance and benefits. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter increased 8.3% to $595 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit increased 16 basis points to 5.6%. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $57.7 million compared to $68.1 million in last year's second quarter.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.5% and compares to 22.3% in the second quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the quarter increased 9.4% to $1.86, which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, where we continue to make great progress strengthening our financial position. Merchandise inventories were $6.6 billion at the end of Q2, a decrease of $191 million or 5.6% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7.4% on an average per store basis. The team continues to do a tremendous job reducing inventory while increasing sales and improving in-stock levels, which is having positive operational impacts in both stores and distribution centers. The business generated cash flows from operations of $1.8 billion during the first half of the year, an increase of 9.8% compared to the prior year. Our strong top and bottom line results along with our focused inventory management efforts continue to generate significant cash flow.\nDuring the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of approximately $130 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return growth opportunities such as new store expansions, remodels and other strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. And while our leverage ratio remains above our goal which is below 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are making great progress towards reaching our target level. Importantly, we remain focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to middle BBB ratings by S&P and Moody's.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our operating performance and financial results. Our strong performance has positioned us to raise our financial outlook for 2025. This update primarily reflects our outperformance in the second quarter and improved outlook for the second half of the year. while considering the potential uncertainty, particularly on consumer behavior as we move through the back half of 2025. With that in mind, we now expect the following for 2025. Net sales growth of approximately 4.3% to 4.8% same-store sales growth of approximately 2.1% to 2.6%, and and EPS in the range of $5.80 to $6.30.\nOur EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and and that we will not repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. Now I want to provide some additional context around our expectations. While we're not providing specific quarterly guidance, the low end of our sales and earnings guidance ranges allow for increasing pressure on consumer spending as we move through the back half of the year, with Q4 potentially more impacted than Q3. In addition, we expect shrink to be a continued tailwind throughout the remainder of the year though to a lesser extent in Q4 as we begin to lap the improvements we made toward the end of last year.\nTurning to SG&A. Given our strong performance, we now anticipate incentive compensation expense to be a headwind of approximately $200 million.\nMoving to the final portions of our guidance for 2025. We continue to expect capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion designed to support our ongoing growth. This includes our continued expectations to execute approximately 4,885 real estate projects 2025, including 575 new store openings in the United States and up to 15 Mexico, 2,000 project renovate remodels, 2,250 project Elevate remodels and 45 relocations.\nFinally, as a result of our strong cash position, we are [indiscernible] cash on hand to redeem $600 million of our senior notes in the third -- earlier in the April 2027 maturity.\nIn summary, we're pleased with our Q2 results, and we're proud a team has done to strengthen our operating and financial position. This business is strong, and we believe Dollar General is well positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth on both the top and bottom lines while creating long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. I'll take the next few minutes to provide updates on 3 of the most important initiatives across the business, as we look to further advance our progress toward achieving our short- and long-term goals. I'll start with our real estate work as we continue to focus on driving sales and market share growth by expanding our unique real estate footprint he while also enhancing our mature store base.\nWe opened 204 new stores in Q2, primarily using our 8,500 square foot format in rural markets. Dollar General continues to serve as a vital partner, bringing value and convenience to communities across the country through new store growth. In addition to our U.S. growth, we opened 4 new stores in Mexico during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 13. Our team is doing a wonderful job serving those communities as we continue to test and learn and further develop that potential growth opportunity. We are also pleased with the progress of our remodel projects. As a reminder, in addition to our traditional remodel program, which we call Project [ RenOVAte ], we have introduced a new incremental remodel program called Project Elevate in 2025. This initiative is designed to drive sales and market share growth in portions of our mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of a full remodel pipeline. These projects include physical asset investments as well as merchandising optimization, product adjacency adjustments and category refreshes, all of which impacts approximately 80% of the total store. We completed 729 project Elevate remodels in Q2 and an additional 592 project renovate remodels during the quarter.\nWhile still early, we expect to reach our goal of delivering first year annualized comp sales lifts in the range of 6% to 8% for project renovate stores and 3% to 5% for project Elevate stores. Importantly, we've seen significant improvements in customer satisfaction in these locations upon completion of the remodels. And we believe the improved performance and customer response in these stores paves the way to make project Elevate a key component of our real estate strategy in the years ahead. The next area I want to discuss is our digital initiative, which serves as an important complement to our expansive store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers.\nOur digital capabilities include an engaging mobile app and website that continues to be very popular with our customers as well as growing our delivery options and DG Media Network. We continue to expand the reach of our delivery options with solutions targeted both new and existing customers. Our DoorDash partnership, which now serves more than 17,000 stores continues to drive significant incrementality and sales growth. To that end, our Q2 sales through this platform increased by more than 60% year-over-year. Building on this success, we partnered with DoorDash to launch our own same-day delivery offering through our DG digital solutions late in 2024. We have now expanded this offering to nearly 6,000 stores.\nWe are also excited to note that we now expect to offer DG delivery from more than 16,000 stores by year's end compared to our previous expectation of approximately 10,000 stores. And most recently, we entered a partnership with Uber Eats to further expand the reach of our delivery capabilities as we provide value and convenience to customers on their platform. We have already expanded to approximately 4,000 stores with Uber and expect to be in approximately 14,000 stores by the end of Q3. Collectively, more than 75% of the orders through these offerings are delivered in 1 hour or less. Ultimately, we believe this suite of delivery options will introduce new customers to Dollar General and drive incremental sales growth while also further enhancing the value and convenient proposition for our existing customer base.\nThe linchpin of our digital initiative is our DG Media Network, which enables a more personalized experience for our unique customer base, while a higher return on ad spend for our partners. We continue to be pleased with the performance of DG Media Network, which is driving significant year-over-year growth in retail media volume as partners seek to access our unique customer base. [indiscernible] is an important component of our strategy to deliver on our long-term growth framework, and we are excited about its potential. Over time, we believe we can leverage our digital initiative to increase market share and drive profitable sales growth while further evolving our relationship with our customers and driving greater customer loyalty within the digital platform. The final initiative I want to discuss is our nonconsumables growth strategy. As a reminder, we are focused on a few key growth drivers in our nonconsumable categories over the next 3 years.\nThese include brand partnerships, a revamped treasure hunt experience, and reallocation of space within our home category. During Q2, we were pleased to deliver positive quarterly same-store sales growth in each of the 3 nonconsumable categories for the second consecutive quarter. Notably, the magnitude of growth was broad-based with same-store sales increases in each of these categories of at least 2.5%. Our brand partnerships are resonating with customers, and we have been pleased with the strong sell-through in many of these sets. As a result of the success as well as our improved execution, our home products category saw its largest quarterly same-store sales increase in more than 4 years. In addition, our Pop shelf stores delivered another quarter of strong same-store sales growth.\nWe continue to be pleased with the performance of the new store layout in this banner, including a greater emphasis on categories such as toys, party, candy and beauty. The Pop shelf banner will also continues to produce learning that we are able to [indiscernible] to our nonconsumable categories in our Dollar General stores to further strengthen the offering for ITG customers. We believe our nonconsumable sales performance, both in Dollar General and Pop shelf stores also benefited from improved execution in our stores and supply chain as well as from the expanded trade-in shopping we've seen from middle and higher income customers.\nThese results, including strong sales performance and market share gains continue to demonstrate that our treasure hunt approach is resonating with the customer. In turn, we believe we are well positioned to serve them in these discretionary categories in stores across both banners, and ultimately drive further growth in both sales and gross margin.\nIn closing, we're pleased with our second quarter performance. Operationally, we are improving execution stabilizing our workforce through lower turnover rates, advancing our key initiatives and enhancing our position for sustainable long-term growth. Financially, we're delivering balanced sales growth, significant margin improvement and strong earnings while also strengthening our balance sheet and operating cash flow. With that said, we have ample opportunity in front of us to drive growth and further improve our operating and financial performance. And this team is laser-focused on delivering on these goals. As an essential partner and communities across the country, our customers rely on Dollar General in all economic environments.\nDelivering on our mission of serving others continues to guide everything we do. and we are excited about our plans for the back half of 2025 and beyond. Lastly, I want to thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication, and I'm looking forward to all we can accomplish together in the second half of the year. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thank you.",

Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter execution particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms.\nAs an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams work diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas. In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross, donating gift cards and through our own employee assistance Foundation. We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later, but importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities, and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead.\nFor today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate.\nTurning to our third quarter performance. On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3, compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales during the quarter and also grew market share in nonconsumable product sales.\nSame-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item. Customer traffic also increased [ 0.3% ] during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continue to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories.\nFrom a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October, and was positive in all 3 periods of the quarter. Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month. While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top line results was immaterial.\nI mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior. We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value, and we are working hard to deliver for them every day. We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted throughout the third quarter, and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year.\nWith that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our back-to-basics work which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenient proposition, we believe over the longer term, we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value.\nBefore I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nFor Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs.\nShrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact.\nNow turning to SG&A. As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.\nAs Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months. While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million, compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%, and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits, offset by the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total nonconsumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year, and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well. We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in-stock levels and drive sales, while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good.\nThe business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52%, as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter. Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding, for a total payout of $130 million.\nNow I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter, as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs. Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance.\nOur updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1%, and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%. These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of 5 fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.\nTurning to gross margin. We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year, as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90. This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.\nWe also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base, as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations.\nNext, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and [ BAA 2 ].\nIn summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance, and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress. To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We're confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our back-to-basic efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising.\nWhen I spoke with you 1 year ago, and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and looked at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain. We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience. With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area.\nI'll start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits. And more importantly, our customers are telling us, as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout.\nNotably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores. This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of [ 2020 ] through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores.\nOur supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associates. We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year, and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience.\nLet me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as [ OTF ]. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved [ OTF ] levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points, and in full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement.\nAs a reminder, as we drive our [ OTIF ] rates higher, we simplified the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates. In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity, and in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities. We exited 4 more facilities in Q3, for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with 3 remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs.\nMeanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping the stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains. I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility. Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores.\nFinally, earlier this year, we began the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers.\nFinally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG deal [indiscernible] which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items storewide during the holiday season. And a low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1. To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points.\nWe have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year. As Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease, and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year. And we are well on our way to meeting that goal, with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms.\nFinally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50%, compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, [ back-to-basics ] has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our 3 priority areas, and we believe we are well positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward.\nI'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond [ Back to Basics ] and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers. And then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March.\nFirst, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter. This pilot launched in September, and we're currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores, and the learnings from that initiative, and our own customer work, have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering with our unique customer base.\nWe believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General, while still providing the value they need. We are quickly learning and refining our process, and over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers. Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform, while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth.\nNext, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience to Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025. With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within 5 miles, or less, of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America.\nAs we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year. More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels, while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the U.S., 2,000 full remodels, and an additional 2,250 project Elevate remodels, and 45 relocations. And we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico.\nWith regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format which will continue to allow for incremental [ cooler ] counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers.\nWe continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average. We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate, and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline.\nThese projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion, and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer-facing areas in the store. Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels. And in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lifts in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores while also driving incremental sales growth.\nTurning to our new stores. As a reminder, we monitor the following 5 metrics of our portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations, new store productivity compared to the mature store base, cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable. Cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately 2 years and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025.\nI want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20% plus. As we discussed, for our '24 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General branded stores in the U.S.\nAs we said before for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities. And nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box, and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products, and we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year.\nI also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year is in the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our [ Back to Basics ] plan. and we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025 as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders. As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\nWith that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator I] Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.\nNow I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference.\n\nKevin Walker\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call unless required by law. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. To allow us to address as many questions as possible in the queue, please limit yourself to 1 question.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our start of the year, including strong results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines. We believe our efforts are resonating with a wide range of customers as they continue to seek value in our more than 20,000 store locations around the country. Our results are a product of the dedication of this team to serving our customers and communities every day. I want to thank each of them for their great work they continue to do in our stores distribution centers, private fleet and store support center to fulfill our mission of serving others.\nFor today's call, I'll begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q1 performance as well as sharing some of our updated consumer observations and our current approach to tariffs. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2025. I will then wrap up the call with an update on some of our key growth driving initiatives.\nTurning to our first quarter performance. Net sales increased 5.3% to $10.4 billion in Q1 compared to net sales of $9.9 billion in last year's first quarter, contributing to the strong top line growth, we opened 156 new stores during the quarter as we continue to expand the number of communities we serve. We also continued to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales during the quarter in addition to growing market share in non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 2.4% during the quarter, driven by growth of 2.7% in average basket including relatively similar increases in the average unit retail price per item and average items per basket.\nCustomer traffic slightly decreased by 0.3% during the quarter but remained strong on a 2-year stack basis as we lapped the 4.3% traffic increase from the prior year's first quarter. We are excited to see broad-based category growth during the quarter with positive comp sales in each of our consumables, seasonal home and apparel categories. With both our seasonal and home categories comping at or above 3% during the quarter. We were especially pleased to see our non-consumable product categories resonate with our customers, for the Easter and early spring seasons. From a monthly cadence perspective, all 3 periods were positive, led by April, which benefited from the later Easter compared to the prior year. We believe these top line results are a testament to our improved execution as well as the customers across multiple income bands seeking value.\nTo that end, we continue to feel good about our everyday low price position relative to other competitors and classes of trade. As a reminder, our goal is to be priced within 3 to 4 percentage points of mass on average, and we ended Q1 within our targeted range. In addition, we continue to carry at least 2,000 SKUs at or below the increasingly rare $1 price point as we seek to help our customers stretch their dollars. We believe this value offering will become increasingly more important to customers in the months ahead.\nDuring our recent customer survey work, DG customers reported having less income than they did a year ago and nearly 60% of our core customers noted that they felt the need to sacrifice some necessities in the coming year. While our core customer remains financially constrained, we have seen increased trade-in activity from both middle and higher income customers. Our data shows that new customers this year are making more trips and spending more with us compared to new customers from last year, while also allocating more of their spend to discretionary categories.\nWe believe these behaviors suggest that we are continuing to attract higher income customers who are looking to maximize value while still shopping for items they want and need. To that end, in Q1, we saw the highest percent of trade-in customers we've had in the last 4 years. We are pleased to see this growth with a wide range of customers and are excited about our ongoing opportunity to grow share with them.\nBefore I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to provide an update on how we are thinking about the impact of the evolving tariff environment on our business. Our direct imports remain a relatively small percentage of our overall purchases with most years in the mid- to high single-digit range, while our indirect import amount varies. In recent years, we estimated amount to be approximately twice that of our direct imports. We have continued to diversify the countries of origin as part of our direct foreign sourcing strategies in recent years Importantly, we have successfully reduced our China exposure to less than 70% of our direct imports, and we estimate less than 40% of our indirect imports are sourced from China.\nWhile we have relatively low exposure, we are working diligently to mitigate the impact of current tariffs on our business as much as possible, using many of the same tactics that we used successfully in 2018 and 2019. These actions include working with our vendor partners to reduce cost in a variety of ways, including negotiating cost concessions shifting manufacturing to other countries where possible, reengineering products or find substitute products. While the tariff landscape remains dynamic uncertain, we expect tariffs to result in some price increases as a last resort, though we intend to work to minimize them as much as possible. In turn, we believe our customers will continue to seek opportunities to save money, and we remain committed to serving them with the everyday low prices they have come to know and appreciate from Dollar General.\nOverall, we are proud of our Q1 performance and the tremendous progress we continue to make in the business, including lower year-to-date turnover at all levels within our retail operations, an improved overall supply chain on time and in full rate, higher in-stock levels and lower inventory levels, all of which has contributed to an improved in-store experience for our customers and our associates. Our efforts are yielding positive results, and we believe we are well positioned to succeed in a wide range of economic environments. As we continue enhancing our value and convenience proposition for our customers with a focus on working toward our long-term financial goals, and creating long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q1, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31%, an increase of 78 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to lower shrink and higher inventory markups. Our shrink mitigation efforts have continued to drive positive results, including a year-over-year improvement of 61 basis points in the first quarter.\nWith regards to damages, the year-over-year change was slightly favorable, which was relatively in line with our expectations. The gross margin increase was partially offset by increased markdowns which were primarily driven by promotional activity during the quarter as we took this opportunity to serve our customers with targeted price markdowns.\nTurning to SG&A which was 25.4% as a percentage of sales an increase of 77 basis points. The primary expenses that were a higher percentage of net sales in the quarter were retail labor, incentive compensation and repairs and maintenance. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 5.5% to $576 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was relatively flat at 5.5%. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $64.6 million compared to $72.4 million in last year's first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% and compares to 23.3% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the quarter increased 7.9% to $1.78 which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, where we continue to make great progress in strengthening our financial position. Merchandise inventories were $6.6 billion at the end of Q1, a decrease of $344 million or 5% compared to prior year. and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. The team continues to do a tremendous job reducing inventory while increasing sales and improving in-stocks which is having a positive operational impact in both our stores and distribution centers. The business generated cash flows from operations of $847 million during the quarter, an increase of 27.6% compared to the prior year.\nThis strong performance is a result of our sales results and ongoing inventory management efforts. Additionally, with a continued focus on strengthening our balance sheet, we were able to use cash on hand to repay $500 million of our senior notes in Q1, which was earlier than the November maturity date and ended the quarter with balance sheet cash of $850 million. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of $130 million.\nOverall, we are very pleased with our cash and inventory positions and the progress we've made in strengthening our balance sheet. We're proud of our strong performance in Q1 and continue to position the business to deliver value for associates, customers and shareholders moving forward. With that in mind, I'd like to discuss our updated financial outlook for 2025. We believe our positive first quarter results are a testament to the importance of our value and convenience proposition for our customers. particularly in a time of continued uncertainty and a financially constrained core consumer.\nFurthermore, our Q1 performance has positioned us well as we look towards achieving our guidance range for 2025. However, the tariff landscape remains dynamic and uncertain, and there is a higher degree of variability in potential outcomes around tariff-related impacts, including on consumer spending, cost of goods and the supply chain. With this in mind, we're updating our financial guidance for 2025 to reflect our Q1 outperformance, while considering a heightened level of uncertainty as we move through 2025. The updated guidance assumes current [indiscernible] rates remain in place through mid-August 2025, when the 90-day pause on increased tariff rates on the goods from China is set to expire. And we have plans in place to address the potential reversion to the tariff rates previously announced on goods from China on April 2, 2025.\nOur financial guidance is based upon our best estimates and assume successful mitigation of a significant portion of the anticipated tariff impact on our gross margin but also allows for some incremental pressure on consumer spending. We believe this is the prudent approach to setting expectations at this point in the year, and we're excited about the potential for our business as we move throughout the year. With that in mind, we now expect the following for 2025. Net sales growth of approximately 3.7% to 4.7%, and same-store sales growth of approximately 1.5% to 2.5% and EPS in the range of $5.20 to $5.80. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and that we will not repurchase shares under our share repurchase program.\nNow I want to provide some additional context around our expectations. While we're not providing specific quarterly guidance, we expect SG&A in Q2 to be pressured by a more significant year-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense than other quarters as we lap the prior year reversal of the incentive compensation accrual. I also want to note that for the full year, we now anticipate incentive compensation expense to be a headwind of approximately $180 million to $200 million. As we look at the top line for the remainder of the year, we expect the potential impact of tariffs on our core and trade-in customers could be more substantial if price increases take effect more broadly across retail.\nMoving to the final portions of our guidance for 2025. We continue to expect capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, designed to support our ongoing growth. This includes our continued expectations to execute approximately 4,885 real estate projects in 2025, including 575 new store openings in the United States up to 15 in Mexico, 2,000 project renovator models, 2,250 Project Elevate remodels and 45 relocations. Importantly, we believe that the tariff impact on our net CapEx will be minimal.\nAll of this aligns with our capital allocation priorities, which begin with investing in our business, including our existing store base, as well as high return growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases.\nFinally, I want to provide a brief update on how we're thinking about and planning to communicate our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. Going forward, we intend to speak to our target calculation using balance sheet lease liabilities in place of the more general 8x rent multiple that we have communicated historically. Using this approach, which aligns with the calculation more frequently used by credit investors and rating agencies, our leverage target is below 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. While our leverage ratio remains above our goal, we are making good progress, reducing it closer to our target level, and we remain focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to middle BBB ratings by S&P and Moody's.\nIn summary, we're pleased with our Q1 results and our performance to begin the year. We continue to make progress against our goals. And while we have more work to do, we're happy to see our efforts translating into improved financial results. We're excited about the future of this business, and we're confident in the long-term approach, including our long-term financial framework. We believe this business model is strong and that we're well positioned to drive sustainable, long-term growth on both the top and bottom lines, while creating long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide updates on 3 of our most important initiatives across the business as we look to accelerate our progress toward achieving our goals. I'll start with our real estate work as we continue to execute a significant number of projects aimed at driving market share growth in new communities as well as in our mature store base.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we opened 156 new stores in Q1, primarily using our 8,500 square foot formats. Notably, the cost to build new stores has risen more than 40% since 2019, and these formats average approximately $500,000 to open, including both CapEx and inventory. Despite this increase, we continue to target healthy returns of approximately 17% on average for our portfolio. This team is working to further reduce cannibalization this year by focusing on new communities for Dollar Jennifer. In addition, we are increasing the number of operating weeks for new stores compared to prior years by pulling forward more projects even earlier in the year. As a result, we expect to open the vast majority of our new stores within the first 3 quarters of this year. We are also pleased with the progress of our remodel projects to begin the year.\nAs a reminder, in addition to our traditional remodel program, which we call Project Renovate, we have introduced a new incremental remodel program called Project Elevate. This initiative is aimed at bolstering performance in portions of our mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of a full remodel pipeline. These projects include physical asset investments as well as merchandising optimization, product adjacency adjustments and category refreshes impacting approximately 80% of the total store. In addition, while the cost of a project renovate remodel is approximately half that of a new store, a project elevate remodel costs significantly less.\nNotably, we anticipate returns on both of these projects to well exceed the healthy returns generated by our new stores. We completed 668 project Elevate stores in Q1 and an additional 559 Project Renovate remodels during the quarter. As we focus on driving greater profitability in our mature store base, our goal is to drive first year annualized comp sales lifts in the range of 6% to 8% for Project renovate stores and 3% to 5% for Project Elevate stores. Between these 2 remodel approaches, we expect to touch approximately 20% of our store base annually and to significantly improve the shopping experience within our stores, while elevating the brand and driving greater top and bottom line contributions from our robust mature store base.\nThe next area I want to discuss is our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our unique store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our digital capabilities include an engaging mobile app that is popular with our customers as well as our website growing delivery options and DG Media Network. Our delivery partnerships with DoorDash continues to exceed our initial expectations for both incrementality and sales. And our Q1 sales through this platform increased more than 50% year-over-year. We continue to seek ways to grow sales through this channel exclusive partnership including expanding the number of stores in the program to more than 16,000 and growing.\nIn addition, we are now processing both Snap and EBT transactions for our delivery orders, which contributed nicely to our sales growth in Q1. Moreover, our partnership with DoorDash has extended to the launch of our own same-day home delivery offering through our DG digital solutions. We launched with approximately 400 stores late in 2024 and have now expanded the offering to more than 3,000 stores as we continue to leverage customers and associates' feedback. We believe our expansive real estate footprint uniquely positions us to offer a compelling home delivery option and ultimately become the fastest delivery alternative for customers and our communities.\nFurther expanding their access to value and convenience that saves them time and money every day. The linchpin of our digital initiative is our DG Media Network, which enables a more personalized experience for our unique customer base while delivering a higher return on ad spend for our partners. We are excited about the potential for the DG Media Network, which grew retail media volume more than 25% in Q1 compared to Q1 of 2024. Over time, we believe we can leverage this offering to increase market share and drive profitable sales growth while further evolving our relationship with our customers and driving greater customer loyalty within the digital platform.\nThe final initiative I want to discuss is our non-consumable growth strategy. As a reminder, we are focused on 4 pillars of growth to drive sales in non-consumable categories over the next 3 years. These pillars include brand partnerships, a revamped treasure hunt experience and a reallocation of space within our home category. We are already beginning to realize benefits from these efforts and have seen particularly strong sell-through in SKUs associated with our brand partnerships. During Q1, we were pleased to deliver positive quarterly same-store sales growth in each of our 3 non-consumable categories. This performance was led by our seasonal category and a strong Easter selling season.\nIn addition, our pOpshelf stores delivered strong same-store sales growth during the quarter, exceeding our expectations and supporting our optimism in the new store layout, including a greater emphasis on categories such as toys, party, candy and beauty. We also continue to leverage learnings from this banner and apply them in non-consumable categories in our Dollar General stores to further strengthen that offering for our DG customers. We also believe our non-consumable sales performance, both in Dollar General and pOpshelf stores has benefited from the expanded trade in shopping we have seen from middle and higher income customers.\nImportantly, our customer feedback, sales performance and market share gains give us confidence that our treasure hunt approach is resonating with customers and that we are well positioned to serve them in these discretionary categories in stores across both banners. In closing, we are excited about the business and the strong results we delivered in Q1. This team is working hard and is laser-focused on continuing to improve execution and implement our initiatives while building on our strong foundation. We are proud of the progress we've made, and we believe we have ample opportunity to continue to enhance the way we serve our customers.\nAnd looking ahead, we believe this work continues to strengthen our position as we work to achieve our longer-term financial goals in the next few years. Our team is excited about the opportunity to serve, and I want to thank our more than 193,000 employees for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. I'm excited about our plans for the remainder of the year and all that we will accomplish together.\nWith that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our team for their continued dedication to serving our customers while executing our back-to-basics plan across the organization. This dedication was on full display at our leadership meeting earlier this month as we had the opportunity to host more than 1,500 leaders of our organization here at Nashville. This event served as a powerful reminder of the passion and talent of this team and the mission of serving others that unites us.\nOn today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q2 performance, I will then share updates on our back-to-basics work as well as an update on our plans for the remainder of 2024. After that, kelly will share the details of our Q2 financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for the full year.\nTurning to our second quarter performance. We continue to make important progress on our back-to-basics plan. However, we are not satisfied with our overall financial results. On the top line, net sales increased 4.2% and to $10.2 billion in Q2 compared to net sales of $9.8 billion in last year's second quarter. Importantly, despite a weaker sales environment for our core customer than we had anticipated, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales.\nSame-store sales increased 0.5% during the quarter, which was below our expectations. The increase was driven by a 1% growth in customer traffic and was partially offset by a 0.5 point decline in average transaction amount, which was driven by lower average unit retail price per item.\nThe comp sales increase was driven entirely by the growth in our consumable category, as customers continue to focus their spending on the items they need at most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in our seasonal home and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in June before turning negative in July. Notably, the 3 softest comp sales weeks of the quarter were the last week of each of the calendar months. This pattern suggests that our customers are less able to stretch their budgets through the end of the month.\nWith that in mind, as well as our continued softness in discretionary sales in our own customer data and survey work, we believe the softer-than-anticipated sales performance in Q2 is at least partially attributable to a core customer that is less confident of their financial position.\nI want to provide some additional context around what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. The majority of them state that they feel worse off financially than they were 6 months ago as higher prices, softer employment levels and increased borrowing costs have negatively impacted low-income consumer sentiment. As a result, our core customer who contributes approximately 60% of our overall sales comes predominantly from households earning less than $35,000 annually. Inflation has continued to negatively impact these households with more than 60% claiming they have had to sacrifice on purchasing basic necessities due to the higher cost of those items, in addition to paying more for expenses such as rent, utilities and health care. More of our customers report that they are now resorting to using credit cards for basic household needs and approximately 30% have at least 1 credit card that has reached its limit. And in our latest survey, 25% of our customers surveyed noted they anticipated missing a bill payment in the next 6 months.\nWhile middle and higher income households are seeking value as well, they don't claim to feel the same level of pressure as low-income households. As customers have felt more pressure on their spending, we have also seen corresponding elevation in the promotional environment beyond what we had anticipated coming into the year. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the increased promotional activity has pressured both sales and gross margin, and we anticipate this will likely continue for the duration of the year.\nThat said, we remain committed to our back-to-basics strategy, which focuses on controlling the things that we can control, including a timely and accurate supply chain, in-store execution and customer-centric merchandising. With this in mind, we have already begun taking decisive action to respond and strengthen our position over the back half of the year.\nI want to take the next few minutes to update you on our back-to-basics progress, which is foundational to our future. And then I will discuss the actions we are taking to build on that progress and deliver a stronger customer experience. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our efforts in the stores have centered around further enhancing the customer experience to deliver the value and convenience they expect in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores, with our associates committed to providing friendly, welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers while also facilitating the positive checkout experience.\nWe have also focused labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores in an effort to significantly improve our in-stock levels and support our sales growth. These efforts have paid dividends as we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our in-stock levels.\nOur supply chain and merchandising teams have also contributed to the in-store progress by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which should enhance both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associates.\nWe are proud of the progress in the stores, and pleased to see our actions continue to resonate with our team in the field as well as with our customers. And we are working hard to continue to advance our progress and further elevate the experience within our stores.\nNext, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year, and we are pleased with what we have seen both in our traditional and fresh supply chains.\nWe have also made good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity. As a reminder, we had previously announced plans to close 12 temporary facilities by the end of the year. We have already exited 11 of these buildings, and now believe we can close at least 2 more by the end of this year. While closing the less efficient temporary facilities, we have built and opened 2 new permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado. We expect both to ramp up operations in the coming months and to ultimately contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation costs over time.\nFinally, we are undertaking the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and, as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year.\nOverall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers.\nFinally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics of merchandising. Providing a meaningful value to our customer continues to be a top priority. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including a strong everyday low price on national and private brands, compelling promotions on sales events and low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1 every day. We have also continued to make strong progress reducing total inventory this year, which Kelly will discuss in more detail in a moment.\nIn 2024, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal.\nFinally, our merchants have done a fantastic job working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside the stores. For example, we have reduced the number of floor stands by approximately 25% through the first half of the year, and we anticipate removing more than 50% by the end of the year. Additionally, we have reduced the number of times we rotate some of our displays, allowing our store teams to spend more time engaging with our customers. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time within our stores for our teams and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience.\nOverall, we are making nice progress as you have heard, and we are executing on the goals we have set for our team. And importantly, we believe we will continue advancing these efforts as we move throughout the remainder of the year.\nMoving forward, we believe our back-to-basic actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including on-shelf availability and convenience, further enhance the associate experience in stores, including improved employee engagement and retention, and ultimately drive improvements in financial results in 2025 and beyond.\nHowever, as I previously mentioned, we are not happy with our Q2 financial results. We know the retail landscape has continued to evolve in terms of the promotional environment and financial constraints felt by our customers, and we are taking immediate action to respond to serve them, while also positioning the business for growth and value creation. With all of that in mind, we are increasing our investment in markdown activity in an effort to support our customers, further drive customer traffic and improve sales.\nWe are investing from a strong everyday price position to further support our customer and maintain a favorable competitive positioning. We believe this investment will work in conjunction with our back-to-basic efforts to further enhance our value and convenience proposition.\nIn summary, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the operational progress we're making, and feel good about the actions we are taking to build on that momentum. We need to be at our best for our customers in times like this, and we are excited about the opportunity to serve them. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional value, and we have seen that when we do so consistently, we build strong brand loyalty that contributes to healthy share gains over the long term. And with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities with value and convenience.\nI am confident this team will continue to rise to the occasion and seize the opportunities in front of us to further enhance the way we serve our customers, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nAs Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For the second quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30%, a decrease of 112 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category and increased shrink. These factors were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision.\nWith regards to markdowns, we are now seeing promotional levels greater than we had anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are increasingly seeking value in their purchasing behavior in addition to an overall increased promotional environment.\nShrink was a year-over-year headwind of 21 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And I want to note that while Shrink continues to be a significant headwind, we are pleased with the progress we're making and believe our actions, including our self-checkout conversions, are having a positive impact.\nTurning to SG&A. It was 24.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 57 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were retail, labor, depreciation and amortization, store occupancy costs and utilities. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter decreased 20.6% to $550 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.4%, a decrease of 168 basis points.\nNet interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $84 million in last year's second quarter.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes.\nFinally, EPS for the quarter decreased 20.2% to $1.70.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of second quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and a decrease of 11% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 13% compared to last year and decreased 17% on a per store basis. Importantly, we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. The team has done a nice job reducing our overall inventory position while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher in-stock levels.\nWe will continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate balance of mix of inventory to drive sales while also mitigating Shrink risk and improving our working capital.\nThe business has generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion year-to-date, an increase of 127% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management.\nTotal capital expenditures for the 26-week period were $696 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million.\nNow I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. On the top line, we've updated our guidance to reflect our second quarter results as well as our expectations that the customer will continue to feel financial pressure for the duration of the year, and the promotional environment will remain elevated beyond what we had initially anticipated. With that in mind, we now expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.7% to 5.3% and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1% to 1.6%.\nTurning to gross margin, we expect additional pressure as a result of the increased promotional markdown activity that Todd noted, as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category.\nWith regard to damages, our guidance now assumes no improvement in the back half of the year, though we are focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. And while we expect Shrink to be a headwind for the full year, our results from the second quarter as well as positive trends in other metrics that are highly correlative to Shrink, including inventory reductions, supporting our belief that we are moving in the right direction to continue mitigating this headwind.\nLooking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see Shrink begin to turn to a tailwind later in Q4 and then become a more material tailwind in 2025.\nWithin SG&A, we are seeing an elevated rate of maintenance expense, particularly with HVAC units and coolers during the summer months. We're taking steps in the back half of the year to be more proactive in addressing these opportunities in order to provide a more consistent customer experience across our store footprint, while also supporting ongoing sales growth. As a result, we expect incremental pressure from the increased repairs and maintenance expense to continue within SG&A in the back half of the year.\nFinally, we are also seeing pressure from wage rate inflation closer to approximately 4% this year, which is higher than was contemplated in our initial guidance for the year. With all of this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $6.20. This guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.\nWe also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver on our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels, and 85 relocations.\nNext in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment, and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases.\nFinally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2.\nIn summary, while we're not satisfied with the financial results for the second quarter, we are pleased with the continued progress in our back-to-basics work, and we believe we're taking the necessary actions to build on this progress and drive the business forward. We remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. And we continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. I want to emphasize that we're confident and excited about the long-term future of this business, including driving profitable same-store sales and deliver meaningful operating margin expansion while generating healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and creating long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me say again that 2024 is about executing on our foundational back-to-basics plan, and we are pleased to be on schedule and making great progress against the goals we have previously outlined. We are confident that the actions we are taking will strengthen our foundation for the long term.\nThis team is energized and laser-focused on our strategy to restore operational excellence while delivering value for our customers and shareholders alike.\nI want to close by thanking our more than 193,000 employees for their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others. It is a privilege to serve alongside them each and every day, and we are looking forward to all we can accomplish together in the back half of the year.\nWith that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

My name is Donna, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, May 30, 2024. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference.\n\nKevin Walker\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and Kelly Dilts, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News and Events. Let me caution you that today's comments include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements about our financial guidance, strategy, initiatives, plans, goals, priorities, opportunities, expectations or beliefs about future matters and other statements that are not limited to historical fact.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, those identified in our earnings release issued this morning under Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K filed on March 25, 2024, and any later filed periodic report, aimed in the comments that are made on this call.\nYou should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call unless required by law. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. To allow us to address as many questions as possible in the queue, please limit yourself to 1 question. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining the call. We are pleased with our start of the year, and I want to recognize the great work of our entire team as they have fully embraced our plan to get back to the basics at Dollar General. On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q1 performance as well as sharing an update on some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q1 financial performance as well as our current outlook for Q2 and the full year. And then I will wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics across the business.\nTurning to our first quarter performance. Net sales increased 6.1% to $9.9 billion in Q1 compared to net sales of $9.3 billion in last year's first quarter. These results included accelerated market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as market share growth in dollars and nonconsumable product sales. We opened 197 new stores during the quarter and are excited about our ability to continue to expand the number of communities we serve.\nSame-store sales increased 2.4% during the quarter, which was above the top end of our Q1 guidance. We believe this result is a testament to the relevance of Dollar General in our communities and the ongoing positive impact of our back-to-basics work. The comp sales increase was driven by strong growth in consumer traffic of more than 4% and was partially offset by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items for basket.\nThe comp sales increase was driven entirely by strong growth in our consumable category by customers relied on us for the value of the items they need most often for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a cadence perspective, growth was strongest in March, including a benefit of Easter moving from April into March this year and was relatively similar in the months of February and April.\nWe believe the softness in sales in the discretionary category during Q1 is a reflection of the continued pressure our core customers feel on their spending. They continue to be very value-oriented, in their shopping behavior, which we see manifested in accelerated share growth in private brand sales as well as increased engagement with items at or below the $1 price point. Importantly, we continue to do well with our core customers while growing with middle- and higher-income trade-in customers from adjacent cohorts.\nWe continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. And our value proposition presents significant opportunity for ongoing growth among a wide range of customers. Looking ahead, we expect value to continue to be the most important consideration for customers in multiple income ranges. We know that our customers need us even more when they face economic challenges, and we are well positioned to help them stretch their dollar.\nBefore I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to provide a brief update on our shrink reduction efforts, including the changes to our self-checkout strategy that we announced in March. Shrink continues to be the most significant headwind in our business, and we are deploying an end-to-end approach to shrink reduction across the organization, including efforts in our supply chain, merchandising and within our stores. To help combat issues around shrink, our supply chain teams are primarily focused on ensuring deliveries are on time and in full and our merchants on reducing the amount of inventory we carry.\nWithin our stores, we are focusing on delivering a more consistent, front-end presence brought in the reach of our high shrink planograms, which include the removal of high shrink SKUs and the elimination of self-checkout in the vast majority of stores. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we converted approximately 9,000 stores away from self-checkout during the quarter.\nFollowing the quick and successful conversion of these stores in Q1, and given the ongoing challenge from shrink, we converted approximately 3,000 additional stores away from self-checkout in May, bringing us to approximately 12,000 conversions completed in total. While this represents a significant change in our stores, we believe this is the right course of action to drive increased customer engagement while also better positioning us to begin reducing shrink in the back half of '24 with a more material positive impact expected in 2025.\nMoving forward, we plan to have self-checkout options available in a limited number of stores, most of which are higher volume, and low-shrink locations. Overall, we are pleased with the results and progress across the business during the first quarter, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and this team is excited about the work we are doing. We have a long history of serving customers in a variety of economic environments, thanks to our distinctive combination of value and convenience. I also want to note that we recently published our annual Serving Others report, which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts and goals.\nWe recognize the great responsibility we have as an essential partner to the communities we call home and are excited about the many ways we are able to serve our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And with everyday low prices, in-store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities across the country. We remain focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General as we look to enhance the way we serve customers, further develop and support our associates and create a long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. .\nAs Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q1, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.2%, a decrease of 145 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, a greater consumable sales mix and lower inventory markups. These were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. Shrink continues to be our most significant headwind and was 59 basis points worse than the first quarter compared to prior year.\nAs Todd noted, we are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink. And I'll discuss our expectation for this headwind for the remainder of the year in just a bit. With regards to markdowns, we're seeing promotional levels more similar to 2019 levels as we anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are seeking value, and we saw strong take rates on promotional items during the first quarter.\nTurning to SG&A, it was 24.7% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 97 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, depreciation and amortization, incentive compensation and repairs and maintenance. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 26.3% to $546 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.5%, a decrease of 242 basis points.\nNet interest expense for the quarter decreased to $72 million compared to $83 million in last year's first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% and compares to 21.8% in the first quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items on lower earnings before taxes and expense recognition attributable to stock-based compensation.\nFinally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.5% to $1.65, which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of Q1, a decrease of 5.5% compared to prior year and a decrease of 9.5% on a per store basis. Notably, total nonconsumable inventory decreased 19.1% compared to last year and decreased 22.5% on a per store basis. The team continues to do great work reducing our overall inventory position while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher end stocks.\nWe're pleased with the significant progress on this important goal, which not only frees up more cash in the business but also helps to mitigate further shrink risk. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business generated cash flows from operations of $664 million during the quarter, an increase of 247% as we improved our working capital, primarily through inventory management.\nTotal capital expenditures were $342 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and proud of these results, including gains in customer traffic and market share, significantly lower inventory levels and improved cash flow from operations.\nMoving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. While it's still early in the year, we believe our positive first quarter results reinforce the importance of our stores to the communities we serve as well as the progress of our Back to Basics work. With that in mind, we're reiterating our financial guidance for 2024 and continue to expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same-store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55.\nThis guidance continues to assume an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense and an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 22.5% to 23.5%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. We continually evaluate and seek to optimize the use of this capital. And as a result, we have updated our expectations for real estate projects in 2024.\nWe now expect to remodel approximately 1,620 stores this year compared to our previous expectation of 1,500 remodels. To facilitate this increase in remodels, we're reducing the number of planned new stores to 730 compared to our previous expectation of 800 new stores. We continue to expect to relocate 85 stores. In total, this increases our expected total real estate project count from 2,385 to approximately 2,435. We're excited about this increase in projects and the expanded investment in our mature stores, and we believe this is an appropriate reallocation of our capital.\nAs a reminder, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged, and we believe they continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return, organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases.\nFinally, although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. Our customer continues to be very value driven, and we anticipate they will continue to be price-sensitive as we move through the year.\nWith this in mind, we expect sales mix pressure to be above our original expectation. And as I mentioned earlier, we have seen and continue to expect the promotional environment reversion to pre-pandemic levels as we move throughout 2024. As such, we expect our promotional markdown headwinds to gross margin will continue at least through the first half of the year. As Todd noted, shrink is currently trending worse than we initially expected coming into the year and we now expect this headwind to be greater in 2024 than what was originally contemplated in the financial guidance we provided on our earnings call in March.\nWe're taking aggressive and decisive action to mitigate this challenge. And we're expecting to see improvement later in the back half of 2024 than we had previously anticipated and more significantly into 2025. Turning to SG&A. Our expectations are relatively unchanged from what we previously provided on our Q4 call. We continue to anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation in 2024 as well as an ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization.\nWhile we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given the somewhat atypical cadence of this year and some of its specific headwinds, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the second quarter. To that end, we expect comp sales to increase in the low 2% range in the second quarter, with EPS in the range of approximately $1.70 to $1.85. In summary, we're pleased with the solid start to our year, including exceeding our top and bottom line expectations for first quarter.\nWe believe our actions are resonating with our customers strengthening our competitive position and reinforcing our foundation for future growth. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. We're excited about the long-term future of this business, including plans to drive profitable same-store sales and meaningful operating margin growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. Our focus continues to center on our 4 key operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low-cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As we have discussed to advance these priorities in the near term, we have implemented a refreshed approach to getting back to the basics to enhance store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores.\nI want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our supply chain, stores and merchandising. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customers. As a reminder, we have prioritized increasing the employee presence at the front end of our stores to provide a friendly welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers, while also facilitating a positive checkout experience.\nAs we have continued to move away from self-checkout in the majority of our stores, we believe this focus is even more important in serving our customers and supporting our sales growth. We have additionally focused more of our labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specified and specialized inventory training in each store.\nOur customers are taking note of these efforts as we have seen a significant improvement in the perception of our in-stock levels, which we believe is contributing to our growth in customer traffic, market share and comp sales. Finally, we have also taken a significant action to make it easier to operate our stores while also enhancing the overall experience for associates and customers. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant strides in serving our stores in addition to the work we have done in the field, such as reducing district manager spans of control, simplifying and eliminating certain activities and reducing inventory.\nWe continue to focus on reducing store manager turnover, which is correlated to sales and shrink results in our stores. Notably, while we still have work to do, we are seeing year-over-year reductions in turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associate. We are proud of this progress and excited to see our actions resonating with our team in the field.\nOverall, we believe the actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on-shelf availability and convenience, enhance the associate experience in the stores, including improved employee engagement and retention and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF.\nOur distribution and transportation teams have taken aggressive action to improve their service to our stores, and these efforts have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year. When we began our Back-to-Basics work last year, we identified an opportunity to exit 12 temporary warehouse facilities, which with lower cost and improved inventory flow throughout our supply chain.\nSince that time, we have exited 7 of these buildings and are in and on track to exit the remainder in 2024. In conjunction with these moves, we are making great progress on our permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado, both of which are scheduled to open later this year and which should contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation costs over time. Finally, we have also begun the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017.\nWork has begun on all 18 of our dry facilities with 4 already completed. We are making quick progress on the others and believe we will finish this work by the end of the year. Once we conclude the [ restore ] process, we believe our store teams will be able to restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on-shelf availability for our customers and increased sales. Ultimately, we believe these actions will enhance the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while driving greater efficiencies and a further improved experience for our store teams and customers.\nFinally, I want to provide an update on getting back to basics of merchandising. Our team's top priority is always delivering value to the customer, and we continue to innovate on ways to provide the products they want and need at affordable prices. These basics are important to our customer, which is why we remain committed to a strong private brand offering, affordable national brands and the $1 price point.\nDespite the inflationary pressures we have experienced over the last year, we continue to carry approximately 2,000 items at or below the $1 price point in the majority of our stores as we help our customers stretch their dollar in our stores each and every day. As Kelly noted, we also continue to focus on meaningfully reducing our inventory position, and the team has done an outstanding job on this front over the past 6 months. In 2024, we committed to a net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of this year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal.\nWe have already made good progress selling through the remaining inventory and resetting planograms to remove these items from our stores. Importantly, we expect a significant portion of the sales of the secondary and tertiary SKUs will transfer to primary SKUs that will remain in our offering. Finally, our merchants have been working with our operators to identify and execute on simplification opportunities, such as reducing the number of floor stands and monthly end cap resets to reduce activities for our store teams. In conjunction with the work of our supply chain teams to optimize the sorting process, our merchants are also working to increase the number of products that can go straight to the shelf, eliminating the need for extra touches within the store.\nCollectively, these actions are designed to save time in our stores, for our teams and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. As we wrap up this morning, I want to say, again, how proud I am of the team's great work and commitment to getting back to basics as we fulfill our mission of serving others. We are moving with great urgency to implement our Back to Basics plan and execute on the things that matter most to our customers.\nAnd while we are pleased with the positive results stemming from many of these actions, we recognize that some of our efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit and we'll continue to work to capitalize on these opportunities. I want to thank our more than 186,000 employees for their ongoing engagement and their passion for our customer. This team is energized and confident in our strategy, both near term to restore operational excellence and long term to deliver value for our customers and shareholders alike. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together throughout 2024.\nWith that, operator, we will now open the lines for questions.",

My name is Robert, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 13, 2025. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.\nNow I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call unless required by law. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, including solid execution and top line results. As we reflect on the quarter as well as the full year, it is clear Back to Basics work has yielded positive results, positioning us well as we enter 2025 and look to the future.\nI want to thank our associates for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. Their dedication is on display every day in thousands of Dollar General stores and in our distribution center, private fleet and store support center as we all work together to fulfill our mission of Serving Others.\nOn today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q4 performance as well as discussing the portfolio optimization actions we recently undertook for both Dollar General and pOpshelf. After that, Kelly will share details of our financial performance as well as our financial guidance for 2025 and will conclude with thoughts on our long-term financial framework. And then I will wrap up the call with an update on some of our key initiatives that we believe will be important drivers of our performance in 2025 and beyond.\nTurning now to the fourth quarter performance. Net sales increased 4.5% to $10.3 billion in Q4 compared to net sales of $9.9 billion in last year's fourth quarter. With this solid finish to 2024, I am excited to note that for the first time in the company's history, we delivered fiscal year sales of more than $40 billion. This is a testament to the essential role Dollar General serves as America's neighborhood general store in more than 20,000 communities across the country.\nWe are here for what matters for the customers every day, and the relevance of our value and convenience offering is clear. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales and also grew market share in non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.2% during the quarter and was driven entirely by growth of 2.3% in average transaction amount. This included relatively even contributions from increases in average unit retail price per item and average items per transaction.\nThis growth was partially offset by a decline of 1.1% in customer traffic during the quarter, which was impacted by ongoing financial pressures of our core consumer as well as lapping the strong traffic increase of 3.7% from Q4 of 2023. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category and was partially offset by declines in our seasonal home and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, all 3 periods were positive with comp sales growth in December and January relatively even and both outpacing November.\nOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation. Many of our customers report that only have enough money for basic essentials with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.\nAs we enter 2025, we are not anticipating improvement in the macro environment, particularly for our core customer. In turn, we know our customers expect value and convenience more than ever. We are committed to providing the value they need and continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade.\nWith regards to current tariffs that have been announced on products that we sell, we believe we are well positioned to mitigate the impact in 2025. We were able to successfully mitigate the tariff impact in 2018 and 2019, though we did take retail price increases in some instances along with others across the industry. Given the already stressed financial condition of our core customer, we're closely monitoring these and any other potential economic headwinds, including any changes to government entitlement programs. Importantly, we remain focused on doing everything we can to deliver the value our customers want and need.\nBefore I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to share an update on our work to continue to strengthen our foundation for future growth. As we look to build on the success of our Back to Basics work, we have undertaken a thorough review of our business to identify opportunities to further strengthen our foundation. With this in mind, we conducted a real estate portfolio optimization review of both our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners during the fourth quarter.\nAs a result of the review of our Dollar General portfolio, we made the decision to close 96 stores. While this is less than 1% of our overall store base, those stores, many of which are in urban locations, have become increasingly challenging to successfully operate. These stores likely would have been closed in ordinary course of the store's life cycle when their leases expired. However, we determined that closing these locations now will allow us to optimize our allocation of resources going forward.\nI also want to discuss the results of our pOpshelf portfolio review. After analyzing business performance and revised outlooks for our current portfolio of pOpshelf locations, we identified 51 store closure candidates based on financial and operational considerations from our test-and-learn phase. We plan to convert 6 of these 51 locations to Dollar General stores and close the remaining 45 stores. This will leave 180 stores remaining as part of the pOpshelf banner.\nAs a result of these actions as well as impairment charges primarily associated with pOpshelf go-forward stores, our Q4 financial results include a negative impact to operating profit of $232 million or approximately $0.81 in EPS. As we enter 2025, we are optimistic about the pOpshelf banner and our opportunity to drive improvements in our sales results as customers' feedback on the brand and shopping experience continue to be strong.\nGoing forward, we plan to build on the strength to increase sales through a variety of initiatives centered around new brand partnerships, an enhanced in-store experience, new and expanded categories, and a new loyalty and digital experience. As an example of these efforts, we recently implemented a new store layout with a heightened focus on toys, party, candy and the beauty categories. While still early, we have been pleased with the results as we have seen a nice double-digit sales lift across a broad array of our pOpshelf stores.\nIn addition to the opportunity to increase sales and ultimately realize further growth in the pOpshelf banner, we are also able to leverage learnings from this banner and apply them in our non-consumable categories in our Dollar General stores to further strengthen that offering for our DG customers. We are looking forward to the opportunity to improve pOpshelf results in 2025, and we will continue to evaluate the brand to ensure we are seeing the desired impact of these activities and optimization.\nIn summary, while we never like to close stores before their lease expiration, we believe this portfolio review across both our DG and pOpshelf banners has further strengthened the foundation of this business as we position the company for the future.\nFinally, I want to take a moment to congratulate both Steve Deckard and Tracy Herman on their new leadership roles within the organization. Steve has been a value strategic leader at Dollar General for many years, and I'm confident he will serve the company well in his new role, focused on expansion of the Dollar General footprint, process improvement and leadership of our corporate strategy. And Tracy's deep experience and connection with our field teams, along with her commitment to operational excellence, execution and innovation, make her the ideal leader for our store operations team as we focus on delivering the best in-store experience for our customers and associates.\nOverall, we are proud of the continued progress we're making and are pleased with how it has positioned us to drive profitable sales growth and capture growth opportunities while creating long-term shareholder value. I will discuss more about our plans and initiatives to drive these results in a few moments. But first, let me turn the call over to Kelly to discuss our Q4 financial results as well as our 2025 financial guidance and long-term financial goals.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nQ4 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.4%, a decrease of 8 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in markdowns, inventory damages and distribution costs and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by lower shrink and higher inventory markups. We continue to be pleased with the results of our shrink mitigation efforts, which drove a year-over-year shrink improvement of 68 basis points in Q4. Shrink improvements have continued through the early part of the first quarter, and we anticipate this benefit should continue throughout 2025.\nNow turning to SG&A, which was 26.5% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 294 basis points. The increase reflects the fourth quarter impairment charges totaling $214 million related to the portfolio optimization review Todd discussed earlier. The other expenses that were a greater percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were retail labor, incentive compensation, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and technology-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 49% to $294 million, including the negative impact of approximately $232 million associated with the charges resulting from the portfolio review. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 2.9%, a decrease of 302 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $66 million compared to $77 million in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.2% and compares to 20% in the fourth quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 52.5% to $0.87, including a negative impact of approximately $0.81 per share associated with the charges resulting from the portfolio review.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $6.7 billion at the end of the year, a decrease of $283 million or 4% compared to prior year and a decrease of 6.9% on a per store basis. I'd like to recognize the great work the team has done to reduce our inventory position while increasing sales and improving in-stocks, while also providing positive operational impacts in both our stores and distribution centers.\nIn 2024, the business generated cash flows from operations of $3 billion, an increase of $604 million or 25%, which was driven by improved working capital management. In 2024, total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million.\nOverall, we're pleased with our cash and inventory positions and the progress we've made in strengthening our balance sheet over this last year. These results are a testament to the strength of this business model as well as the focused efforts on getting Back to Basics across the organization.\nWith that in mind, I'd like to discuss our financial outlook for 2025. We plan to continue building on the progress we've made, and our guidance for 2025 contemplates continued investment and work to further strengthen the foundation of this business. Importantly, we believe these efforts will lay the groundwork for growth in the years ahead, which I'll discuss in just a moment.\nWith that in mind, we expect the following for 2025. Net sales growth in the range of 3.4% to 4.4%, same-store sales growth in the range of 1.2% to 2.2% and EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.80. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. We expect capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, designed to support our ongoing growth and which is aligned to our capital allocation priorities that continue to serve us well.\nAs a reminder, our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we're excited to begin work on approximately 4,885 real estate projects in 2025, including 575 new store openings in the United States, 2,000 full remodels, 2,250 Project Elevate remodels and 45 locations and up to 15 additional new stores in Mexico. In addition, we are investing in a number of technology projects, including a finance and HR modernization project, which is primarily focused on a new enterprise resource planning system that will be implemented over the next couple of years.\nNext in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment, and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. To that end, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share. We do not plan to repurchase common stock this year, although share repurchases remain an important part of our future capital allocation strategy.\nFinally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2.\nNow let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2025. While our guidance is centered around a macro-neutral outlook, the full range does recognize that there's still uncertainty both in the broader macro environment as well as for our core customer. We are currently anticipating continued economic pressure on our core customer though at a relatively consistent level to what they were experiencing as we close 2024.\nWith regards to gross margin, we expect the most significant factor to be continued positive shrink results, which we anticipate will be a tailwind throughout 2025. Within SG&A, we're taking action to reduce controllable expenses throughout the business.\nThat said, we expect to deleverage in 2025 at our current expected levels of sales and operating expenses. This pressure includes an ongoing headwind from retail wage rate inflation, which we expect to continue between 3.5% and 4%. In addition, we expect our operating leverage to be pressured by a return to normalized short-term and long-term incentive compensation after 2 years of significantly lower-than-average payouts. At target payout, this represents a headwind of approximately $120 million. Finally, we expect a continued headwind from depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of higher capital spending and inflation in building materials in prior years.\nWhile we do not anticipate providing quarterly financial guidance, I do want to provide a couple of notes on our expected cadence of financial results in 2025. We expect the first half of the year to be more pressured by initial expenses related to our remodels, including Project Elevate, as we expect to execute more real estate projects in the first half of 2025 than we did in the first half of 2024. Importantly, we are working to complete the vast majority of our real estate projects by the end of Q3 in order to maximize the number of operating weeks which will benefit 2025.\nIn addition, we expect Q1 to be impacted by additional labor expense and -- labor expense headwinds compared to Q1 of 2024 when we still had self-checkout in a majority of the stores. Importantly, we believe our plans for 2025 will position us well to drive growth in subsequent years as we look to begin moving toward our medium- and longer-term financial goals in the subsequent years.\nWhile the recent focus has been on Back to Basics actions and supporting the core business, we believe we are poised for future growth as we look to 2026 and beyond. With that in mind, I want to discuss our long-term financial framework. We manage our business with a sharp focus on creating sustainable long-term shareholder value. Following a successful year of strengthening the foundation and as a part of our ongoing strategic planning process, we have updated our medium- and longer-term financial framework, particularly for the next 3 to 5 years, and we'd like to share our updated perspective with you today. It's important to note that we are aiming to achieve some of these components of this model sooner than others. So I will note our specific goals as well as the respective targeted time lines.\nStarting with net sales. We are targeting annual growth in the range of approximately 3.5% to 4%, including approximately 2% new unit growth, both of which we plan to begin in 2025. Beginning in 2026, we're targeting annual same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 2% to 3%. These ranges assume that our core customer, while always seeking value, returns to a more stable financial condition and also that we will drive more of our same-store sales through our mature stores.\nTurning to operating margin. We're targeting expansion to begin in 2026, and then longer term, to continue expanding toward our goal in the range of approximately 6% to 7% as early as 2028. We have a variety of gross margin and SG&A catalysts to drive this expansion moving forward.\nSpecifically, within gross margin, we are working to drive improvement that will build over the next 5 years centered around the following. First, expanding the contribution from our initiatives, particularly our DG Media network, but also including other efforts such as our non-consumable merchandising strategy. Collectively, we believe the potential benefit from all of our initiatives, some of which Todd will discuss, is approximately 150 basis points.\nNext, we're focused on returning to prepandemic shrink levels, which we believe represents a potential benefit of approximately 80 basis points; and also improving damages, which we believe represents a potential benefit of approximately 40 basis points. And within SG&A, we are targeting reductions over the next 5 years through initiatives aimed at simplifying work and driving efficiencies, reducing repairs and maintenance expense, and optimizing capital expenditures to stabilize depreciation and amortization expense.\nMuch of the focus of Steve Deckard and his team will be centered around many of these areas. Ultimately, our goal with these efforts is to increase profitability and minimize SG&A deleverage on sales over the medium to longer term. Our capital allocation priorities will continue to drive our financial strategies. We are targeting annual capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of sales and expect to be in position to restart share repurchases as early as 2027. We believe this long-term framework will enable us to continue investing in growth initiatives that expand our ability to serve customers with value and convenience while also returning cash to shareholders. Finally, beginning in 2026, our long-term financial framework seeks to deliver annual EPS growth of at least 10% on an adjusted basis.\nIn conclusion, we're excited about the plan and the future of DG and are confident in our long-term approach. We believe the business model is strong, and we are well positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth on both the top and bottom lines while creating long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. We're excited about our plans for both the near term and long term. And I want to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the most important initiatives across 4 areas of the business. I'll start with some of the near-term actions focused on building on our Back to Basics work to further enhance and store experience for our associates and customers.\nWe know that an essential part of convenience for our customers is the ability to not only reach the store easily, but also the quality and speed of their in-store experience. We are focused on retraining in our stores and asking our teams to recommit to creating a fast and friendly experience for our customers on every visit. To enable our associates to deliver on this effort and focusing on serving our customers, we are also working to further simplify the operating model by removing unnecessary activities and friction points from our stores. These efforts include a continued focus on inventory reduction and SKU productivity.\nWe believe these efforts, along with further assortment and allocation optimization, will contribute to the shrink and damage improvement contemplated in our long-term framework. We are also working on tasks upstream, such as sorting in our distribution centers and case pack optimization, to allow our teams to get products to the shelf even quicker with less touches.\nFinally, we are targeting completion of our next-generation point-of-sale rollout in the first half of the year, which will simplify the checkout process as well as other in-store activities. Ultimately, we believe these efforts focused on our core business will build on the progress we've made and allow us to better serve our stores and our customers.\nNext, I want to briefly mention Project Elevate, which we announced in December. As a reminder, this is our new incremental remodel initiative aimed at bolstering performance in portions of our mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of a full remodel pipeline. As we focus on driving greater profitability in our mature store base, our goal for Project Elevate stores is to drive first year comp sales lifts in the range of 3% to 5% while also mitigating future expenses, particularly in repairs and maintenance. These projects include physical asset refreshes as well as merchandising, optimization and will impact approximately 80% of the total store.\nWhen combined with our enhanced full remodel program, which we call Project Renovate, we expect to touch approximately 20% of our store base annually and to significantly improve the shopping experience in our stores while elevating the brand and driving greater top and bottom line contributions from our expansive mature store base.\nThe third area I want to discuss is our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our unique physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. We are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties, including our mobile app, website, delivery options and the DG Media Network. We have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in more than 16,000 of our stores. We expect to continue growing sales through this channel exclusive partnership in 2025 as we continue to expand the number of stores in the program. In addition, we recently began processing both SNAP and EBT transactions through this program, which we believe will drive new customer acquisition and continue to drive incremental sales.\nImportantly, the learnings from this initiative, along with our own customer work, have provided the foundation from which to launch our own delivery offering with our unique customer base. As we announced last quarter, we began a test of same-day home delivery from a handful of our stores in September. We have begun expanding this offering more broadly and are currently partnering with DoorDash to fully execute a delivery offering through our DG digital solutions from approximately 400 stores.\nWhile it's still very early, we have been pleased with the initial customer response to this offering, including higher average baskets than those in our brick-and-mortar stores. We believe our expansive real estate footprint uniquely positions us to offer a compelling home delivery option and ultimately become the fastest delivery alternative for customers and our communities, further expanding their access to value and convenience that saves them time and money every day.\nLooking ahead, we plan marketing to drive awareness of this opportunity in the current stores while also beginning to scale this offering more significantly with the goal of up to 10,000 stores by the end of 2025.\nThe linchpin of our digital initiative is our DG Media Network, which enables a more personalized experience for our unique customer base while delivering a higher return on ad spend for our partners. With the expansion of our delivery offering, our multichannel platform will enable us to accelerate the scaling of our media network in 2025 as well. In turn, we believe we can further evolve the relationship with our customers, driving greater customer loyalty within the digital platform, while ultimately increasing market share and driving profitable sales growth.\nThe final initiative I want to discuss is our non-consumable growth strategy. Our 3 non-consumable categories, home, seasonal and apparel, combined to deliver more than $7 billion in sales in 2024. Our customers have continued to respond favorably to the treasure-hunt approach we introduced in our stores as evidenced by our continued market share gains in these categories.\nHowever, as the overall discretionary shopping environment has softened, we have seen our consumable sales well outpaced our non-consumable sales in recent years. As a result, the lower-margin sales have pushed our overall gross and operating margins as consumable sales mix has continued to climb to 82%. In conjunction with the financial framework Kelly laid out earlier, our goal is to increase non-consumable mix by at least 100 basis points by the end of 2027 and ultimately return non-consumable sales closer to approximately 20% of the overall sales mix over the next 5 years while maintaining our strong performance in our consumable businesses.\nTo reach this goal, we have identified 4 pillars of growth to drive sales in non-consumable categories over the next 3 years. These pillars include, first, brand partnerships, where we look to build on the success of current programs to work with well-known brands to showcase quality and value for our customers. The second is a revamped treasure hunt, where we plan to upgrade our rotational home assortment to enhance the value equation for our customers. Next is the reallocation of space within our home category. This pillar is focused on reducing less productive space in certain departments and reallocating to more productive and relevant offerings for our customers.\nThe final pillar is focused on increasing productivity in non-consumable categories by injecting newness in core planograms and noncore space allocation, such as new programs in certain categories, while leveraging category innovation in more established programs. We are implementing a multipronged marketing approach to showcase the breadth and quality of our assortment in these areas while amplifying the value message. Ultimately, we believe we can capture additional market share to drive significant top and bottom line growth in alignment with our long-term financial goals.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the way we ended the year. While 2024 had its challenges, particularly for our core customer, it was an important year for Dollar General to get Back to Basics and fortify the foundation of this great business. We are proud of the progress we made on this front, and it has positioned us to take the next steps forward in 2025. And as Kelly noted, this work has also enabled us to lay the groundwork for our long-term financial goals over the next few years. Our mission of Serving Others continues to guide everything we do, and we are excited about our plans for 2025 and beyond.\nWe were pleased to have the opportunity to spend time with more than 1,500 field leaders in various cities across the country in February. From that time together, I can tell you this team is energized and confident in our strategy to restore operational excellence and deliver value for our customers and shareholders alike. I want to thank our more than 194,000 employees for their commitment to each other and to our customers. I'm looking forward to all that we can accomplish together in 2025.\nWith that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

Huillard\n\nIndependent Director, L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nSo, good morning to you all. Thanks for joining us this morning for the presentation of our 2023 annual results. It's a rather special presentation, folks, you'll recall. Jean-Christophe LefÃ¨vre-Moulenq is attending for the last time, and I'm sure later we will express our affection to him. For 35 years, he's been following the construction business in general, and VINCI, for 30 years, we should almost have hired him. Christophe, we're going to miss you, but you'll no doubt come back and attend our various meetings.\nSo, just a few words on the photographs you recognized on the cover page. The preferred stadium of the French people we're proud of it, because we built it together with Bouygues. We know we've been operating it for over 25 years. It's a 30-year concession. It's probably including globally the stadium that will have hosted the greatest density and diversity of major events.\nYou all attended the BeyoncÃ© concert in 2023, the Rugby World Cup in 2023. You're all going to attend the opening or closing ceremony of the games to be held at the Stade de France, as well as that of the Paralympics. We're extremely proud of this and have been present in the group since it's existed under the name of VINCI. It's an asset to which we're particularly attached.\nAnd this shows that the amendment pertaining to the western bypass of Montpellier, that underwent a few difficulties, is now back on track. The amendment was approved at the end of last year. We're going to be able to start the work keenly awaited by the local population. There are people sometimes who are against it, but essentially widely awaited by the locals.\nThis is just to illustrate the fine success of VINCI Airport. The Dominican Republic has granted it a 30-year extension of the concession that will run through to 2060. This is an asset that we've been managing since 2016, which was expiring in 2030. We've extended terminals, recertified environment projects, a new terminal on Las Americas Airport, Santo Domingo. This, of course, was useful in convincing the government that it made sense to team up with us through 2060. A symbolic shot of our resolve to roll out highways beyond French borders. We acquired, with a closing in May 2023, Entrevias managing 570 k's of highway in San Paolo. And section-after-section of this dual-carriageway that was inaugurated for 2 new sections very recently.\nNext, VINCI Energies signed with Senelec, the Senegal Power Authority, a fine project. 1,350 high-voltage power lines with the transformer substations to offer universal access to electricity. This success, hence the photograph, is a fine example of what we call networking, the ability of the various entities to come together to deliver successes. Of course, local teams here, but a great many French teams through French BUs and also Moroccan BUs. It's the addition, the combination of these 3 strengths that allowed it to achieve this fine success.\nStill, HV lines, this time Cobra in consortium with 2 partners. One has significant PPP, 35 years on the design, financing, building, operation and maintenance of several hundreds of lines of HV and associated substations to collect green power from new fields inland to deliver it to the coast where the major consumers are New South Wales, Australia. It's also important to show you this one because it's part of Cobra specialties.\nCobra was a pioneer in PPPs awarded in Brazil for HV lines. They've won and delivered about 20,000 kilometers, maybe 22,000 kilometers over the past 20 years. This is symbolic because it's proof positive of the need for the energy transition as such, that public purse isn't enough for a number of countries before Brazil, now Australia, a number of countries use this to accelerate this transition and to muster private money through PPPs. We think this PPP model is going to continue to be rolled out on the energy front, perhaps not on all countries, maybe not in France, but in many countries worldwide. And we're, of course, very comfortable with this concept because PPP is what we do well.\nAnd engineering, the building and maintenance of HV is a specialty, both of VINCI Energies and Cobra. But in the interim, before the world has reached a fully electric world, we'll have to continue to use for a while transition energy, gas, LNG. We need producers, storage tanks. We got a real expertise through VINCI Construction in the engineering building of cryogenic tanks for LNGs.\nWe built the 3 tanks shown on this photograph, and the client for design and build entrusted us with a fourth tank here in Rotterdam. And an artist's view of a wonderful joint and intergenerational project given by VINCI Real Estate in downtown Angers. It's both mixed and intergenerational. It's a big tree, a lot of plants everywhere. It's got a nursery, a senior residence, urban B&B, rooftop offices, vegetable garden for those interested. And, of course, housing units with the under relating terraces that you see with wall to wall plants.\nSo this is really just to get a better understanding of the group that's sometimes a bit difficult to understand. It's not a sense that is VINCI. So to return to 2023 performance, they can be described as excellent, very good quality revenue and earnings are sharply up.\nOnce again, reaching record levels, we continue to expand internationally. That was clearly our roadmap by the past to international now accounts for 57% of our activity. Free cash flow, as Christian will agree, has reached an outstanding level, exceeding all expectations, including our own net financial leverage is sharply down. Cherry on the cake order intake has renewed very satisfactorily. So we're confirming this year-after-year.\nCollectively, we're very resilient for 2 main reasons. The first is that we got the right value creating model in the 3 business lines, concessions, energy construction. But we also have the right organization, a management model, which means that we are a community of entrepreneurs, very involved, agile as seen during COVID, but also extremely rigorous and constantly seeking the right balance in the 3 dimensions that achieve global performance, economic, environmental and social.\nIn particular, this year confirms and illustrates the opportunities that lie ahead with the very powerful drive on the back of the energy environmental transition. And all our activities were directly involved in what is happening regarding the future of the planet. It's a central challenge for our businesses today. We're convinced that, it will be increasingly so and increasingly defining for our businesses going forward. I decided that the leading thread of my swift presentation will be this economic and energy and environmental transition.\nSo in concessions, low carbon transport infrastructure is the precondition so that we can continue to move about to travel, ship goods. And of course, the mobility needs have never been so high worldwide. And since transport represent a significant share of CO2 emissions, the world won't achieve net 0, if it doesn't look at de-carbonizing mobility. It's our conviction that's what VINCI Autoroutes is with the low carbon highway initiative, making available charging stations for passenger vehicles. That's now done.\nThere are charging stations everywhere across all the service areas of VINCI Autoroutes, trialing dynamic recharging by induction or rail in the ground. It's being trialed on 2 sections of the A10 just outside Paris. And once we get the results, that is around 2025, we'll have to find the ways and means in conjunction with other stakeholders and the state, if it's smart to roll this out across certain corridors so that a particular truck, but not only can partially recharge on the road.\nOffering trucks with electric batteries that are lighter because some of the electric power is captured on the road. VINCI Highways, car sharing, car parks and multimodal interchanges to promote shared mobility.\nSo with all this equipment, we have pretty much what it takes. When I say that the e-charging stations on the areas everywhere, you might think that the job is done. We can move on to something else. But in fact, we're only at the beginning of the story. We're going to have to massively increase the number of this infrastructure. When we look at the need for charging stations, the day e-mobility has reached maturity, it's about 7x more charging stations, probably even more than 7x in terms of power, because the stations will be high power.\nWe're only at the beginning of the process. And let's not think that because we see these charging stations everywhere, it's just the beginning of the process. We'll need a great many more ditto for intermodal, interchanges or car co-sharing platforms to boost mobility investment.\nIf we really want to achieve low carbon roads and highways, so as to achieve net 0 by 2050, the investments required are huge, especially if you add to that, which is even more necessary. That is investment to adapt to extreme weather events, because most of the networks worldwide were built, designed at a time where there weren't such extreme weather events. So we must revisit these investments to avoid having floods, fires that block traffic or even significant biodiversity losses.\nAnd of course, these huge challenges can only be addressed collectively, the public, the private, academic, researchers, economists. And that's the purpose of the Alliance for a Low Carbon Road, launched by FranÃ§ois Germaine, who's a leading economist, environmentalist, who's co-authored the 6th IPCC report, launched this initiative. And of course, we are actively contributing to that effort.\nIn Airports, we've become the leading global private airport operator, 2023 at the end, to erase the impact of COVID with very buoyant traffic levels, such as, but not only Portugal, Serbia. We're emerging stronger from this crisis, thanks to excellent cost containment, improvement of revenue per passenger. It was counterintuitive, but that's what we're seeing, and EBITDA margin, which de facto sharply up.\nBut also, thanks to the integration of Mexican airports benefiting, that was our calculation. Strong recovery, because of the near shoring of a number of industries from America. Tesla has decided to set up a plant, I don't know, if it's batteries or cars, probably cars, several billion dollars. So the near shoring impact has really boosted traffic at Monterrey and airport traffic. And the 30-year extension of our 6 airports in the Dominican Republic that work very well, and we're going to be able to continue to operate for 30 years. We're also, VINCI Airports, very well embarked on our roadmap ahead of time, net 0 airports.\nWe plan to reduce by 50% our CO2 emissions in 2030 versus 2019. We're already there, VINCI Airport. Also, VINCI Airport is revising its commitment, now wants to be 2/3 reduction in CO2 in 2030 by -- 2019, with airports that will soon be net 0 emissions, such as Toulon Airport this year, that of Lyon, that will achieve that status in 2026.\nThese are important things for the planet, of course, but also important for our expansion, because we're seeing that clients, when they look at who to call upon for their airport assets, realize that we're recertifying from the environmental standpoint the airports that we operate. We continue to work with our partners on replacement fuels, SAF, and probably hydrogen further down the road. What's important is that no major technological barrier to achieve net 0 in air mobility, except when the aircraft goes from 1 aircraft, flies from 1 airport to another. There's no major tech barrier. There is, however, a barrier, but it's actually economic, and so will take some time to cross. But once it's crossed and it'll end up by happening, we'll have air mobility that's carbon neutral. Maybe I won't see it. Yes, 96. So I'll see it. It will lead, as for road mobility, to an in-depth transformation of the whole sector.\nOur highway development is continuing beyond French border. BogotÃ¡-Girardot, Colombia, and the closing of Entrevias in Brazil, very interesting deal. A 12-year concession to finance, install and operate 106 ultra-fast recharge stations in Germany. We won it all after a German tender. We were entitled to win 3 lots, and that's what we did.\nEnergy business, we're a global player, complete along the value chain. These activities are clearly driven by the powerful groundswell of energy transition, such as COP28 wants to see a tripling of renewables by 2030. It may seem unrealistic, but it demonstrates the global awareness on the need to develop swiftly de-carbonized electric power to meet the electrification of all human activities from industry that must electrify through mobility that I mentioned, including buildings that will also be electrified.\nJust a quick focus on that. You know that in a country such as France, in the energy mix, you have electricity accounts for 25%. The rest is essentially exclusively that is fossil fuel. If we want to be net 0 by 2050, that 25% must rise almost 100%. So, obviously, at the same time, there'll be significant efforts that has many opportunities for our VINCI Energies, Cobra, VINCI Construction efforts in terms of improving energy efficiency. But it means that energy consumption of electricity will be increased by 2 or 3-fold over the next. And that's really not well understood. We think that we got our nuclear power plants in France that were beginning to export electricity. We sold a bit in Germany, but it's nothing compared to what we'll need because the world is in a phase of electrification. And that's what's driving the momentum of VINCI Energies and Cobra and a bit VINCI Construction. Also concerns nuclear power. That's a new era with the kick-starting of major programs. A country such as France doesn't have enough EPRs. Also, other countries that have understood that renewables won't solve the equation that I've just mentioned. That is electrification of all segments of human activity with very strong demand for de-carbonized electrical energy.\nFor EUR 1 invested in the production of green power, we'll have to devote the same amount to reconfiguring, extending power grids that requires huge investment, which, in my view, won't be within reach for the public purse. And the Australian project is kind of heralding what we're going to see in a number of countries, not necessarily in France, because in France, it'd be too long to explain. The grid needs a lot of billions, but not as many as in countries that have current output sources very different from those of the future.\nExample, in Germany, EPR was focused on high-polluting plants, increasingly because they've rejected nuclear power for the time being. It's essentially renewables from the North Sea, so you can imagine that. To bring this electricity to consumers, industries that have intense needs, we have to totally revamp the high-voltage electricity grid. We understood that 10 years ago. That's why we acquired GA Gruppe at VINCI Energies 10 years ago. It took a while to happen, but it's key.\nGermany's going to have to devote how many? I don't know. Let's say hundreds of billions to reconfigure, extend. It's a HV transmission network, given the reasoning. All this explained at VINCI Energies strong growth in activity, above EUR 19 billion. Jean-Christophe recalls the level a few years back. That's quite amazing. Strong order intake, over EUR 20 billion, cherry on the cake.\nVINCI Energies is once again boosting its EBIT margin to 7%. Cobra's riding the same wave, the same favorable wave with the ramp-up of major projects. EPC, as they're known in particular, high-voltage transmission lines, not a Cobra exclusivity. VINCI Energies does that, but Cobra in countries that are being equipped, such as Brazil, now Australia, and other example, AC/DC converter stations that are absolutely key for offshore wind. When the wind farms, more than 50Ks offshore Cobra's fairing well has boosted its EBIT margin, rising to 7.5%. Cobra's following a roadmap for developing renewable EPAP, 1.4 gigawatts under construction in addition to the 0.6 giga already under production in Brazil. We should reach at the end of this year 3.5 giga either under construction or in production.\nWhat's true for energy also applies to construction. A growing share of projects are part of environmental energy challenges. The e-battery gigafactories, electric interconnections, that VINCI Construction and Energies want in the Bay of Biscay between France and Spain and future generation of nuclear plants, of course. We're going to build, the government says, at least 14. We think probably more. So we don't need them yet. We'll probably have a lot of work coming from the delivery of these EPRs.\nThere's also this energy and environmental challenge in the major hydraulic structure, a step. These pumping stations for energy transfer by pumping, the one we're completing at Abdelmoumen in Morocco, but also in transit projects, low-carbon Great Paris Express in France, HS2 in the U.K., Toronto Metro Auckland City Rail Link in New Zealand. There's a rise in the number of public transportation projects for the environmental transition. These are opportunities for us.\nAnd of course, final point, let's not forget, probably less visible today, VINCI Construction will also take advantage of investments in climate resilience. Canada, Calgary, we're building a big reservoir that's there to receive the storm water in the event of considerable rainfall so that the water is temporarily stored before being gradually released so as not to flood the surrounding land.\nAnd of course, we must reduce the carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency, preserve natural resources, biodiversity. These are powerful drivers for renewing our building activities. It's striking to see that when 4 years back, we pledged to reach 90% of low-carbon concrete by 2030. Well, quite frankly, I thought it was a bit ambitious. I didn't see how we were going to get there, but we're going to deliver that sooner and faster than planned. Why? Because our people have embraced this challenge with incredible determination and energy.\nThe Nantes Hospital that's under construction is fully built with low-carbon concrete. So it's happening, and we're seeing proof of that with images to show. So maybe not everywhere in the world, but in geographies where the industry is there, we'll reach 90% low-carbon concrete by 2030 without major difficulties.\nSo these megatrends of VINCI Construction and good order intake allows us to continue to be highly selective. It's not any more complicated than that. Continue to improve EBIT margin, as was the case in 2023. VINCI Real Estate, not quite the same situation. VINCI Real Estate is going through a very serious crisis. There's a 30% decrease in housing starts, but VINCI Real Estate continues to expand in the service residences for students, seniors, co-living. We've already got 2.\nAnd also, VINCI Real Estate is delivering its roadmap on the pledge-made, what was it, 2019, 0-net artificialization that, by 2030, we'll be able to demonstrate that they've maybe artificialized when they couldn't do otherwise, but in exchange, they've de-artificialized in projects of urban recycling.\nSo as you can testify, several years we've been alerting on the social housing bomb that represents this collapse in the housing sector that doesn't have a major impact for us in terms of works impact. Many other players in the construction sector were there. This time bomb is now exploding. And the good news is we heard the Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, make a pretty strong statement on housing.\nWe're now waiting for actions to free up planning permission, encourage local authorities to build, accelerate procedures, and assist first-time buyers. So it's probably going to be still challenging in 2024, but as long as we start delivering, we need a housing minister, but we should know by the weekend with a decrease in interest rates that should lead to seeing light at the end of the tunnel by the end of the year.\nOver to Christian. I was a bit long, so Christian's going to make up for lost time.\n\nChristian Labeyrie\n\nCFO & Executive VP\n\nI don't really see how I'm going to be able to do that, especially as I have a couple of metric tonnes of figures to share with you, starting off with our revenue figures, EUR 69 billion, give or take. For those of you who have an elephant's memory, it was EUR 33 billion or so in 2010. So a little bit more than 10 years ago. We've more than doubled our revenue in a dozen years or so. That wasn't one of our targets, but it is what ended up happening in 2023, 12% up, 10% of which is organic growth. You have the breakdown on the slide of the growth in each poll. Head of the pack VINCI Airport, 24% growth like-for-like. In fact, it's actually 47% if you account for scope variation.\nAs Xavier said, this comes from our continuing traffic numbers that continue to go up and also airport and non-airport traffics that keep going up. Cobra is up 18% as well VINCI Energies is up 11%, which for the overall branch, means we're at 15% growth. And construction is keeping up well, with an increase of about 10% there. VINCI Motorways 5%, which for VINCI Motorways given the maturity of the network is very good performance as well in terms of revenue growth. The only blemish on the report is, of course, the drop in revenue for VINCI Real Estate 19% negative there, mainly residential properties, which account for about 3/4 of overall revenue. But just to give you an understanding of this VINCI Real Estate only accounts for 2% of overall revenue for the whole group.\nScope variation, 2.5% here, which does mean EUR 1.6 billion in revenue shifts, including the integration of OMA in Mexico by VINCI Airports, about EUR 640 million in revenue there and recent acquisitions of VINCI Energies in 2022, which are now applied full year in 2023 and also the 2023 acquisitions. Overall, about 30 acquisitions per annum, EUR 860 million in extra revenue from those acquisitions. The main impacts come from the end of 2022 acquisition of the IT services of Kontron, a German group now present all around Eastern and Central Europe, an extra EUR 400 million in revenue there. And more recently, January 2023, we acquired Otera in Norway. This is a company that works on electric grids in Norway.\nForEx is negative, which is often the case for us, because the euro keeps going up. That was the case in 2023 versus the American dollar and the pound sterling. The pound sterling, the U.K., is our second largest market with more than Â£5 billion in revenue in GBP from there. And the U.S. is our fifth largest market with revenue at about EUR 3.4 billion.\nOn the next slide, you can see a comparison between France and International segments. The growth in revenue is very significant internationally, plus 16%, 13% organic. That's twice the growth we're seeing in France, which is a little bit less than 6% organic growth, which is still solid nevertheless and is higher than inflation, which was a little bit less than 5% in 2023 in France.\nVINCI is therefore continuing to become more international as a group, as you already heard from Xavier. We're now at 57% of overall revenue coming from non-French sources. That was exactly the opposite, not just a few years ago. I've already mentioned the U.K. and the U.S. as our markets. Germany is our third largest market with EUR 4.8 billion in revenue from there. In Spain, thanks to Cobra, is our fourth largest market with EUR 3.5 billion in revenue from Spain.\nMoving on to our operating profit, what we call ROPA in our jargon. So this is our overall integrated companies. We're at EUR 8.4 billion nearly, an increase of 22% versus 2022. All poles are contributing to this increase in profit. So it's a remarkable performance across the board. VINCI Airport doubled its contribution versus 2022, EUR 1.9 billion from them. This EUR 900 million swing year-on-year beyond the effects that I've already mentioned, such as air traffic coming back, such as revenue per passenger going up as well, also is due to proper cost control and the integration of OMA, which accounts for about 40% of the increase of the contribution to profit from VINCI Airport about 23% of the overall.\nVINCI Motorways on their side have also put in an excellent performance, EUR 3.4 billion, a 7.5% increase versus the previous year, more than the increase in revenue therefore, and VINCI Energies, Cobra IS and VINCI Construction also have contributed record levels of profit in revenue and margin. 7% for VINCI Energies, a contribution of EUR 1.4 billion, that's 20 base points more than last year. Across business lines, geographies, poles and regions, we've seen basically improvement and contribution at about 7%. Cobra is at EUR 490 million, a 7.5% margin there, 10 basis points up last year. Overall, EUR 2 billion contribution, which is roughly the same share of the total at about 22% as VINCI Airport.\nVINCI Construction also keeping up with the pack with EUR 1.3 billion contributed in operating profit, 4.4% of revenue, 20 basis points up versus 2022. This comes from the new organization that was set up 2 years ago over there, 7 divisions, 3 geographical divisions, 2 business line divisions and 4 for France, and the highly selective order policy that we've applied thanks to Xavier.\nVINCI Real Estate is losing about EUR 53 million. This is due to the impact of sales. When you sell in batches, of course, you make less money in terms of margin than when you sell individually. And also, we have provisions on stocks, especially office real estate.\nContinuing down, IFRS 2, which represents the -- which is related to the employee shareholder plan and the employee saving plan of VINCI, that IFRS 2 part remains stable, but it is likely to increase in 2024, because the accounting doctrine has moved forward in the interim and is going to force us to do things a little bit differently to the way we've done it in the past. And also, our increase in share price is driving up the IFRS 2 costs.\nThe other indicators are also significantly improved. We've got the impact of the contribution in equity share, which is up as well. Kansai Airports as well are now back in the black in 2023 when they've been losing money for a while after COVID. In this, you'll also see ADP's dividend. Dividend is now sharing -- is now paying out a dividend once again, which wasn't the case since COVID and in 2022, we also had provisions for our Russian investments, which you would have found in this part 4.\nNon-recurring items, EUR 105 million negative. This is a recalculation in part of earn-out. So the extra money that we have to pay to ACS as part of our development of Cobra's renewable energy development. We have to pay EUR 40 million for every gigawatt to ACS.\nThe cost of debt has gone up significantly. I mentioned it, although not quite as much as what we expected for this year, an increase in cost of debt of about EUR 300 million, EUR 280 million more precisely. About EUR 150 million comes from the increase in rates. So this is the net impact of rate increases on our variable rate debt. We've been able to mitigate that impact by increasing the yield of our treasury investments, which are short-term managed. So they're variable by definition.\nAnd also, we have restructured the acquisition debt for Gatwick, which has helped us keep it limited to just EUR 150 million increase in financial costs related to increase in rates. And on top of that, we have the impact of companies which were out of scope until recently, such as the Colombian Motorway, which carries debt at a relatively high rate as well. And also the impact of external growth, mainly the acquisition of OMA.\nWe've seen other significant swings in other financial indicators. We had EUR 157 million there versus EUR 279 million for other financial income and expenses. Let me explain what happened there. Actually, the rates went down at the end of 2023, whereas, of course, full year, they're higher than they were on average in 2022. That meant that we had to re-update our provisions, which as we said, our long-term provisions are updated at current value. So, if the rates go down, then that leads to not a cash cost, but an accounting negative, including for VINCI Motorways, especially in this case.\nThere's also an ADP effect. As I said, since we deconsolidated ADP at the end of 2020, the share price of ADP has an impact on our accounts with the 8% stake we have there. You'll remember when their price went up, it was an extra EUR 100 million. This time, we have the opposite. We have a cost, because ADP saw negative changes in share price in 2023, but things have gone back up since.\nAs a reminder, also in 2022, we had exceptional profit from Gatwick, which had paid back some bonds early with EUR 130 million in profit from that. All of this goes to explain the significant swing that you can see in these financial indicators.\nMoving on now, previous slide, yes. Taxes are up, which makes sense because our profit is up. The tax rate is about the same, 28%. Once you take into account minority interests, you can see minority stakes here. So companies that we don't owe 100%, but their share prices have gone up. So the money that goes to our partners has gone up as well in OMA, in Gatwick, and the Lyon Airport as well.\nNet profit, EUR 4.7 billion, EUR 8.18 per share, up 10%. Here, we have the changes in debt across the year 2023 with a EUR 2.4 billion drop in net debt. We've got EUR 6.6 billion in free cash flow, EUR 1 billion in financial investment, which is added to that to EUR 6.6 billion, and then EUR 3.2 billion handed out to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. So that explains the EUR 2.4 billion. Now you might be saying, okay, EUR 6.6 billion, tell us more about that EUR 6.6 billion. And I need to be cautious about this because I gave forecasts last year, which ended up being pretty far off the mark. We actually far outperformed my forecasts.\nEBITDA in 2023 beat our expectations. This is from the good results that I already explained. EBITDA, EUR 12 billion versus EUR 10 billion the previous year, an increase of EUR 1.8 billion there, half of which comes from VINCI Airport.\nOn VINCI Airport, about half of that comes from the integration of OMA, and the rest is the organic improvements in the profitability of VINCI Airport. We also have a contribution for VINCI Motorways, about EUR 267 million there. VINCI Construction, EUR 200 million; and the energy branch EUR 365 million. This is spread about 2/3 across VINCI Energies and 1/3 for Cobra.\nAll of the poles, therefore, contributed to the significant increase in EBITDA. On top of that, as you can see, we saw positive variations, so a financial windfall of working capital requirement, a delta of EUR 1.5 billion, so EUR 1.5 billion more. This is a sum of a number of different components. Of course, we took in more money than we had any right to expect. As I remember, about EUR 250 million in a single day, given the size of the group, that's a big number. That means that all it takes is messing up the forecast by a few days, and our free cash flow forecast set out. Also, some big contracts in Cobra, about EUR 400 million in prepayment came in for Cobra, and some provisions for operations, which, as VINCI always does, were done conservatively.\nWe have energy and construction provisions, which are done very conservatively, so that went up by about EUR 500 million. All of this explains EUR 1.5 billion total WCR, an increase in financial costs and taxes, taking EUR 3 billion versus EUR 2 billion last year. And CapEx, as I announced, is significantly up, EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.8 billion in CapEx, spread across EUR 600 million VINCI Motorway. That's relatively stable year-on-year. VINCI Airport is also at EUR 600 million. That's double what we had last year. VINCI Energies, EUR 600 million versus EUR 500 million last year, so an increase there. A stability for Cobra at EUR 600 million as well, but with a different mix in CapEx, moving more towards renewables, but it's pretty much the same thing. And Construction is also up EUR 200 million in CapEx versus last year.\nAs you can see, all of the poles are growing and investing, leading us to EUR 3.8 billion in CapEx, EUR 1 billion in investments, acquisitions. It's a relatively low year historically for us, acquisitions for about EUR 350 million in VINCI Energies. The acquisition of the stake in Brazil, as Xavier mentioned, for a Entrevias Motorway, EUR 300 million there. And we integrated the Colombian Motorway into our books, which hadn't been consolidated in the past. That was a further EUR 250 million tonne.\nHere's a reminder of how cash flow is generated at VINCI. It's a little bit different from a lot of other companies, which are much more regular. What is regular at VINCI is the cash flow generated by concessions, especially motorway concessions, although, there's a lot less traffic at the beginning of the year versus the summer. It's still quite regular, as is the case for VINCI Airport. However, for Construction and Energy, it is the second part of the year that we see a lot more. It's a very seasonal business with its ups and downs. So it's actually very difficult to come up with reliable forecasts for free cash flow.\nDecember is in itself about a 1/3 to a full half of free cash flow for the year. So for these reasons, I will not be formulating any forecasts for free cash flow for the coming year. I tried it once. I got wrong. So this time, I will hold my peace.\nNext, we have the long-term outlook. We can see that we have overcome some thresholds. We were above EUR 2 billion, then we were above EUR 3 billion, then we were pushing EUR 4 billion before COVID, and now EUR 5 and EUR 6 billion. Now, it's not going to go up by EUR 1 billion every year, but it just goes to show how far we've come with average growth of 12% per year, more than profit, which is 9% per year. We generate more cash flow than profit with a ramp-up since 2018.\nThings to take into account in cash flow, we have WCR requirements that vary based on the cash flow for large, major projects, and also our investment programs. Our investment programs are mainly tied to our motorway, airport, and renewables concessions contracts. So that's the kind of impact that we're going to see on our cash flow going forward. And we'll be able to provide you with more information on our assets, such as airports, of course. We're very aware that we need to give you more details on airports and our assets in renewables as well, and the energy business more generally.\nThe consolidated balance sheet for Vinci is not all that different, with EUR 50 billion in capital employed, mainly in long-term assets such as concessions. It's a pretty even spread between VINCI Motorways, a bit less than EUR 20 billion of VINCI Airport, which is about EUR 20 billion as well in capital employed. And the energy branch, which is ramping up with about EUR 10 billion in capital employed there if you include the acquisition of Cobra. Equity is at EUR 32 billion and EUR 16 billion in debt, which we previously analyzed the EBITDA versus debt is 1.35, which is very good, and that is because acquisitions were relatively average last year. That does not include our investments in Dominican Republic, EUR 7 million, EUR 8 million there, because that will be booked in 2024.\nThe economic reality is that actually, it's a bit more than EUR 1 billion in financial investment, which is the figure that I gave you earlier. These are some pie charts, but you know them already off by heart. This is mainly for the people who don't really know the Vinci model very well and the relative weighting of our various business lines and the weight of those on our indicators. Construction and Energy is very present in our revenue, less in our capital employed. Concessions are more the opposite of that, with a lot of our capital employed being in that and less of our revenue, and it's about a 2/3, 1/3 split between our long-term businesses, \"and our more short-term, less long-term businesses\".\nAnd to wrap up my part, our financial policy for the group, you know this already because I say it every year, but it's important to give you a refresher. What you can see on the left is that on the bar charts, liquidity is relatively unchanged, about EUR 19 billion to EUR 20 billion total, and that is spread between credit lines that we have with our banks and cash that we have on hand.\nAs net cash managed has gone up significantly, which is because of the high number of incoming payments at the end of 2023, we felt that it was not necessary to keep EUR 10 billion in credit lines, so we drew that down to EUR 6.5 billion at the beginning of 2024. This reduced our financial costs related to those credit lines and also helps open up more credit facilities on other things in the future.\nOur credit rating is still the same. I think we're even outperforming the ratios that the ratings agencies give us, but that's a good thing, and it might change over time. And despite an overall financial market that is challenging, we were able to issue EUR 1.7 billion in new debt. Now, this isn't necessarily public debt. There's a private investment that's more than our reimbursements, EUR 800 million. We got an average majority of 6 years at a rate of 3.5%, which is pretty good given the current rates for 2023.\nAnd our VINCI Concession project finance teams and our Cobra teams were also able to, over the course of the year, implement a number of mechanisms to finance projects, such as the Colombian Motorway, Lyon, Belfast Airport as well, where there's going to be investment required there, Cape Verde, which is a contract we won recently, and the significant photovoltaic plans for Spain for Cobra. All of this means that the stars are aligning for project funding. More than EUR 1.1 billion added to that EUR 1.7 billion, a pretty active year in terms of our funding activities.\nAnd to wrap up here, we have our traditional slide on the cost of debt. We've gone from about 2%, which was our average cost of debt up until 2022. That went up to 4%. We don't know where this is going after this, but I believe that it's going to stabilize. And it might even go down a little bit. One can dream maybe even for the Eurozone. Euros are about 2/3 of our debt. So we're quite exposed to other currencies, such as GBP through Gatwick. And you can see that pound went up and the dollar went up as well. And other currencies, the more exotic currencies as well, such as South American currencies also impact our accounts, because they have rates that are much higher than OECD countries.\nWe've reduced our exposure to variable rate loans, which is important to note. We don't have the graph. I don't know, you might find it in one of the appendixes. But our variable part of rate of the debt is completely offset by cash. So our exposure to variable rate debt is very low for 2024, and it makes us less exposed as a group to the cost of debt changes.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you very much, Christian.\n\nXavier M. P. Huillard\n\nIndependent Director, L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nThank you, Christian. Briefly, before we move to Q&A, we are addressing the year 2024 with a lot of calm and confidence. French highways, you see here that they're returning to their growth profile. That's to say, correlated with major macro indicators, we expect to record a slight growth as long as events such as the recent farmer's crisis that impacted us a fair bit, don't happen again during the course of the year. Time will tell.\nVINCI Airports, we expect to slightly exceed traffic levels recorded in 2019. We said earlier that it was the case right at the end of 2023, the challenge is to ensure that that continues in 2024 full year. And in particular, thanks to the continued catch-up in Japan that was running a bit late, but picked up sharply these past few months in the integration of Cape Verde Airports and the construction business.\nOrder books are at an all-time high. Watchpoint is that it'd be difficult, possibly even a bit hazardous, to continue to grow at the same pace as 2023 for a simple reason. Sign a deal is easy. Even I can do that. But then you have to deliver. And for that, you need talents at all professional levels and cyclically. Well, the talents are pretty scarce. Let's not carry it away. Let's not sign what we can't implement and be even more selective year-after-year than we have been so far. Just as an aside on this, many clients, many countries through their public procurement approaches solely focused on the financial luggage and don't incorporate what results from the change of paradigm, the world for talents.\nSelect a supplier, a constructor who has an acceptable price, but who has the ability to deliver. That's what's changed since COVID, and it's not going to change any time soon. It's going to waste our talent. And let's not grow the machine too fast, avoid to die by overdose in signing contracts that we can't successfully deliver on because human resources are not as extensive as what we thought. So all this is favorable for our margins.\nTake a look at what's happening in Japan. Nicolas could tell you about that later in Japan. EUR 500 million works to do. You have to get down on all 4. The constructor offers sake if you're lucky. There's one who's happy to look at your application. Then you're being really flexible. Mr. Constructor, of the clause is okay. Terms and conditions, prices a bit more, a bit more cost plus fee. Of course, I'm overstating here. Why? Because Japan has a shortage, probably growing, of people who can deliver, particularly in our businesses. I'm not claiming that we're all worldwide in that same trip, but gradually, little by little, we're changing paradigm, and the ability to deliver will be at least as important as price.\nNo need to say that all our clients don't agree with that argument. All this to say that VINCI Energies is expected to post renewed organic growth, not to mention M&A that it's familiar with, less than in 2023. It's a good news for the reasons outlined. Whilst confirming its excellent level of operating margin, Cobra will record a further increase in revenue. There's no M&A at Cobra, and maintain the high level of margin achieved in 2023, 7.5%.\nThe total capacity of renewables, we should be at 3.5 giga, either under construction or operation. At the end of 24 of VINCI construction, the goal as for last year remains to continue to improve the operating margin without searching for growth in particular. I said the same thing last year, but we had both. Had we focused on revenue, we wouldn't have had margin growth. The fact that we're focusing on the margin and to have maybe as a cherry on the cake, sometimes revenue growth there at work. So the right method is that focus on the margin.\nVINCI Construction hasn't yet reached the margin level that it laid claim to. We need to continue to work on that, which means to be increasingly selective, so as to gradually generate a bit more than 4% margin for Vinci overall. What do we expect? Further increase in activity, but more limited than in '23, and inflation should continue to trend downwards. Of course, in '24, we'll have to begin to factor in the tax on long-distance transport infrastructure for an amount close to EUR 280 million, even if, and we can return to that later, we are determined to fight against it this time.\nAnd we think we have some pretty compelling arguments allowing us to quash it. In spite of this negative impact of the tax that's, of course, going to impact, of course, net income like any tax, it's not tax-deductible. The 24 result should be close to the level reached in '23. So on this basis that the Board will propose to the AGM to pay a dividend of EUR 4.5 per share, EUR 1.05 interim dividend already paid out.\nAnd just to end, spend 3 minutes on the last and final slide, which I view as interesting on the left. We've got the situation calculated pro forma for ASF and Escota acquired back in 2006, pro forma '06, full year, concerning the arrival of ASF, Escota. Back then, Autoroutes represented 60%, highway total EBITDA. The rest was essentially other small concessions and some energy.\nToday, if you do the same calculation, you see that in the interim, that is over 17 years. First off, we improved by EUR 8 billion our EBITDA. And the way in which this EBITDA is formed is very different, thanks to the very proactive efforts on the development of VINCI Airports and other concessions outside and the spectacular growth of our Energy division.\nIn 2023, VINCI Energies plus VINCI Airports plus a few smaller concessions represent EBITDA generation number higher than that of the highways, leading the highways to learning account, 39% of EBITDA generation. So, basically, it's the summary of the strategy, we've implemented over 17 years. It's not rocket science, the idea. We're aware that highway concessions will come to an end even if we're not despairing of having the possibility of extending them a bit. No need to make let's not injure the future. Of course, these concessions are going to come to an end. The largest ASF is expiring in 12 years. Others further out, but more modest than ASF.\nAnd so the goal is to make sure that when that day comes, of course, we'll book a drop in EBITDA, but in relevant terms, it's less of a hardship given all the other proactive developments done in the interim VINCI Airports. And energy, that's what this slide tells us. It's basically with numbers what the message that we've been driving home for 17 years now, I think.\nOkay, Jean-Christophe gets to ask the first question. Once you've retired, you won't be able to speak first.",

Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be back at Dollar General. I have a deep passion for this company and for the customers we are privileged to serve. I continue to believe in this model, our future growth prospects and our ability to deliver value and convenience for our customers, a positive experience for our employees, and long-term value for our shareholders.\nWe take our mission of serving others seriously and know that our customer is facing financial constraints and communities are looking for strong partners in a tough macroeconomic environment. Historically, we've met those challenges head-on and delivered for our customer. And we believe that we are well positioned to do so now.\nIn retail, one of the best ways to diagnose the state of the business is by looking at it through the eyes of the customer. And we know that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. We have spent the last several weeks taking a fresh look at all areas of our business as well as the challenges and opportunities in front of us.\nWe believe that we have a good understanding of what we need to do to address those challenges and opportunities, and we're already taking action. To be clear, this is not about rebuilding a team or organization, but about refocusing efforts already underway. This is where I want to spend the majority of our time today.\nI won't share all the details this morning but I want to provide an overview to highlight our focus on getting back to the basics in our stores, in our supply chain and within our merchandising. After that, Kelly and I will review our third quarter performance.\nI want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends for our customer. As we drive improvement across our store footprint, we are doing so through the lens of our customers. As we have previously announced, we are investing approximately $150 million in store labor hours this year. After review, we continue to believe this level of investment is appropriate. But as we do with every dollar we invest, we must ensure we are spending it to drive the greatest return, which means we are directly helping our store teams support our customers.\nWith that in mind, we have made the decision to redeploy labor hours away from smart teams and instead more directly to our store teams and a greater emphasis on customer service and store-level inventory management activities.\nTo that end, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus we believe will drive the greatest improvement in our stores. First, we plan to increase the employee presence at the front end of our stores and in particular, the checkout area. While self-checkout has contributed to the convenient proposition for our customers in certain stores, it does not reduce the importance of a friendly, helpful employee who is there to greet customers and assist while the checkout process is happening.\nWe have already begun by allocating more labor to front-end activities and clearly communicating our expectations around the visible presence of an associate at the front of our stores.\nSecond, we are reemphasizing the role played by our store teams in our perpetual inventory management process, which we believe will positively impact our on-shelf availability as well as our customers' convenience perception in our sales.\nTo do this, we are reallocating some of our labor investments toward store level inventory management processes including an even greater focus on getting product on to our shelves more quickly. We are also reducing the span of control for our district managers which will provide more opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams and more consistency and execution across the store base.\nAs we take these actions and focus on the basics in our stores, we believe we will see improved retention at the store manager level where our turnover is currently higher than we like. And we know from experience that when we stabilize the store manager position, the entire store and team benefit, which ultimately drives a more positive experience for our customers as well as improved sales and shrink results.\nOverall, we believe these actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service, on-shelf availability and convenience as well as sales, while our focus on the front end should also reduce shrink. These efforts also should help us improve employee engagement and retention.\nNext, I want to talk about our supply chain. We have made significant progress recovering from the distribution capacity constraints that we had discussed late last year. However, through the lens of the customer, we see additional opportunity for improvement, particularly when it comes to serving our stores.\nAs we focus on getting back to the basics, the goal within our supply chain is for our truck deliveries to be on time and in full, or OTIF. As we continue to drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplify the work for our store teams, which again results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates as well as an expectation of higher sales.\nI want to briefly highlight 3 areas of focus within our supply chain. First, we plan to better optimize the inventory within our distribution centers. As I will discuss in a moment, we are taking steps to reduce inventory, including SKU rationalization, which will allow for the more efficient movement of product for our distribution teams. Second, we are implementing productivity improvement initiatives within our distribution centers. While productivity rates have been impacted by both internal and external factors, we are working to mitigate or eliminate productivity impediments for our teams and control the things we can control.\nThese efforts include standardizing system configurations and optimizing the product layout in our facilities, while providing clear communication on performance standards and expectations.\nAnd third, now that we're past the capacity constraints we experienced last year, we are reducing the number of temporary outside warehouse facilities being used to store product as inventory flows more effectively to and through our existing distribution centers.\nBy better leveraging these existing distribution centers and taking advantage of the new permanent facilities we have opened over the last year and those we will open next year, we believe we can significantly reduce the amount of temporary warehouse space needed.\nAs we've done historically, we likely will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities. However, we expect to transition out of many of them in Q4 and into next year. All of these actions within our supply chain should translate to lower distribution and transportation costs, better OTIF rates and better customer experience and all while improving sales results.\nFinally, I want to speak to our focus on fundamentals and merchandising. Once again, we reflected on our approach to the eyes of our customer. For our merchants, there is no greater priority than offering great value of the products our customers want and need.\nOur customers are offering living paycheck to paycheck and continually tell us that value is the most important factor in their shopping decisions. I am pleased to note that we are in good shape when it comes to our everyday pricing. And we are right where we want to be in our price gaps with our competitors and classes of trade.\nWith that said, we are taking a hard look at what else we can do to drive value for our customers in this challenging economic environment, including highlighting private brands and other opportunities for savings as well as maximizing the effectiveness of any promotional activity to drive traffic and share growth.\nBeyond these opportunities for our customers, we have also challenged our merchants to consider how they can drive simplification for our stores and supply chain as well with meaningful SKU rationalization as one of the most immediate areas of focus.\nTo that end, we have identified several opportunities to eliminate certain SKUs that have become less productive; first, by moving them out of our DCs and then ultimately to our stores to sell through. As our store teams have fewer SKUs to manage, we can lower our cost to serve, while driving higher inventory turns and higher sales of products that are most important to our customers.\nWe believe these actions will help further reduce inventory and shrink, while simplifying operations in both DCs and stores to drive greater efficiencies over the longer term.\nWe all know that driving traffic and market share are essential to long-term retail success. And while our results have been improving in these areas, we are still not satisfied with our current position. We believe we have identified actions that will pay dividends over both the short and long term, as we remain focused on driving profitable sales growth.\nIn summary, we are getting back to the basics here at Dollar General across all levels of the organization. Our desired results will not materialize overnight, but we believe we will see some early wins and continue to make progress towards executing on the fundamentals that have been foundational to our success over the past 85 years.\nAs a result, we believe we will significantly enhance the customer experience while driving higher sales and increased profitability in our business.\nNow before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to briefly discuss some of our top line results for Q3 as well as our 2024 real estate plans, which we announced earlier this morning.\nNet sales in the third quarter increased 2.4% to $9.7 billion compared to net sales of $9.5 billion last year's third quarter. Within our net sales growth, we again grew market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as an overall non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales decreased 1.3% in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. The decrease was driven by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by units and included declines in all 4 product categories.\nFrom an overall monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was very similar in all 3 months of the quarter. However, I'm pleased to note that customer traffic was positive in Q3. After starting the quarter slightly negative, traffic turned positive in the middle period and improved sequentially each period of the quarter.\nNotably, Customer traffic and same-store sales continue to improve in November, which, although early in the quarter, we believe reflects early traction from our work on getting back to the basics here at Dollar General.\nTurning to a quick update on our customer. During our most recent survey work, our customer continues to tell us they are feeling significant pressure on their spending which is supported by what we see in their behavior. Based on these trends and what we see in the macroeconomic environment, we anticipate customer spending may continue to be constrained as we head into 2024, especially in discretionary categories.\nThis further reinforces the importance of the work we're doing today, and we believe our unique value and convenient proposition is as relevant as ever in this marketplace. To that end, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth next year as we look to extend our offering to many more communities.\nReal estate continues to be one of our core competencies and we remain pleased with the performance of our real estate projects. As a reminder, we monitor the following 5 metrics of our new store portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations; new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in 2 years or less; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 18% on average in 2024.\nI want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, are down modestly from our historical target of 20%-plus. This change is being driven partially by higher new store openings and occupancy cost, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. We also continue to see strong performance from our remodel stores, which drive comp sales lifts between 8% and 11% for our DGTP format and average returns, which continue to be greater than what we see from our new stores.\nWith this consistently strong performance, we continue to see real estate projects as one of our best uses of capital. In fiscal 2024, we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations.\nWhile this is a significant number of projects, I want to acknowledge a smaller number than we have opened in the recent years due primarily to a couple of considerations. First, we want to ensure that our teams across the company are focused on getting back to the basics and the efforts I discussed a few moments ago.\nAnd second, the capital required to execute these projects has increased significantly. For example, the initial opening of our 8,500 square foot store has increased more than 30% since we began rolling out the larger format in 2022. Additionally, nonresidential construction costs have increased significantly since pre-COVID.\nOur team has a number of efforts underway to reduce these costs, including engineering costs out of the projects. And we believe, over time, we will be able to mitigate some of the impact we have seen from inflation.\nWith that said, our pipeline remains robust. We continue to see more than 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General bannered stores in the United States. And as we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high.\nWe continue to innovate on store formats as an important element of our real estate strategy, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our plans for 2024. We are placing a heavier emphasis on rural stores in 2024 with more than 80% of our new stores planned in rural communities where we believe we can have the most significant and positive impact for our customers.\nIn addition, more than 90% of our new stores and relocations will be in 1 of our larger store formats, which continues to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box. These larger stores also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings to help them build meals to feed their families more health and beauty products and fresh produce in many stores.\nAlso included within our store plans are approximately 30 new pop shelf locations as we continue to move at a measured pace with this concept in a softer discretionary sales environment.\nFinally, we've been very pleased with our initial entry into Mexico and our new store plans for 2024 also include approximately 15 new Mesuper Dollar General stores in Mexico. Turning to remodels. Nearly 70% are planned to be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for significant increase in cooler count as well as the potential to add fresh produce in many of these stores.\nWe are excited about our real estate plans for 2024 as we continue to grow the number of communities we are serving, particularly in rural America. In closing, we have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us, which we are uniquely well positioned to capture. We are working diligently on getting back to the basics, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers while providing meaningful opportunity for our employees and creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I now would like to turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nFor third quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29%, a decrease of 147 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in shrink, lower inventory markups and increased markdowns. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs.\nTurning to SG&A, which was 24.5% of sales, an increase of 183 basis points. This increase was driven by retail labor, including approximately $29 million of our targeted labor investment as well as depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance, rent, professional fees, other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 41.1% to $433.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 4.5%, a decrease of 330 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $82 million compared to $54 million in last year's third quarter, driven by higher average borrowings and higher interest rates.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3% and compares to 22.8% in the third quarter of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to increased benefits from federal employment tax credits and an increased benefit from rate-impacting items caused by lower earnings before taxes for the third quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a higher state effective tax rate.\nFinally, EPS for the quarter decreased 45.9% to $1.26. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to last year and a decrease of 1.8% on a per store basis. In addition, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 15% compared to last year and decreased 19% on a per store basis.\nWhile the inventory growth rate has significantly moderated from its peak in the third quarter last year and the quality of our inventory remains good, we continue to believe there is opportunity to optimize and reduce our inventory levels. We continue to review our markdown plans related to the previously announced $95 million investment including associated costs to ensure we are maximizing the impact of these actions.\nWe are focused on optimizing our overall inventory position to better support our customers, stores, distribution centers and growth plans. Year-to-date, through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of 15.5%.\nTotal capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.2 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $129.5 million. As planned, we did not repurchase shares this quarter.\nNow I want to take a moment to provide an update on our financial outlook. We continue to expect the following for fiscal year 2023. First, net sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Next, same-store sales in the range of a decline of approximately negative 1% to flat, and EPS in the range of $7.10 to $7.60 or a decline of negative 34% to negative 29%. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%.\nFinally, we expect capital spending in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, and no share repurchase activity.\nLet me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for the rest of 2023. While we continue to see a more constrained consumer and softer sales trends than we expected coming into the year, those trends were anticipated when we provided our guidance update in October.\nWe have always been an all-weather brand and aided by the actions that Todd outlined earlier, we are poised and ready to serve our customer in this challenging economic environment. In the near term, we expect continued overall pressure on the sales line, particularly in the nonconsumable categories.\nWithin gross margin, in addition to sales mix pressure in our previously announced markdowns, shrink has continued to be a sizable headwind, and we expect this will remain with us into next year as any shrink improvement typically takes at least a year from a store's most recent count to show up in our financial results.\nPartially offsetting these challenges, we expect benefits from greater distribution center capacity and performance, lower carrier rates, our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also continue to expect realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and the DG Media Network.\nTurning to SG&A. We plan to make the remaining $50 million of our planned total labor investment of approximately $150 million in our stores during Q4. Overall, the investments we have previously discussed in retail labor markdowns and other areas to better support our customers, stores and distribution centers are expected to total up to $270 million in 2023, which is consistent with our previous expectations. We are reviewing every aspect of these investments to ensure we maximize their impact for our customers and stores while driving the greatest return moving forward.\nOur capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and our strategic initiatives.\nNext, we return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment. And finally, over time, and when appropriate, share repurchases. Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in order to support our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2.\nWith all of that said, cash generation is very important, particularly in this environment, and we are focused on maintaining and improving strong cash flow as we head into 2024.\nIn summary, we remain committed to maintaining our discipline and how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Todd.\n\nTodd J. Vasos\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Dollar General Corp.\n\nThank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me just say again that we're laser-focused on getting back to the basics. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, some of these actions will take a little bit more time to deliver the desired results. But we expect to demonstrate significant progress over the coming months and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead. .\nThis team is energized, and we are confident in the actions we're taking to drive operational excellence for our customers and employees and long-term value creation for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their commitment to doing the work necessary to serve our customers and communities every day.\nI am proud of this team, and look forward to serving our customers together as we move through this busy holiday season.\nWith that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] . Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffery Carl Owen\n\nCOO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. Before we discuss the quarter, I want to address the tragic event of last Saturday. On August 26, we lost 1 member of the DG family and 2 customers to a senseless and hate-filled active violence in our store in Jacksonville, Florida. We extend our deepest sympathies to their families and friends as well as to the greater Jacksonville community. It is in times of tragedy when community matters more than ever. Right now, we are focused on providing support, counseling and resources to our teams and their loved ones. We are evaluating how we can best support the local community during this difficult time, and we stand with our team in Jacksonville and across the organization who are leading with empathy and courage. We are appreciative of local law enforcement's quick response in Jacksonville, and their continued support in protecting our associates, customers and communities every day across this country.\nThank you. And with that, we'll now begin today's call. We made significant progress in the second quarter, advancing several important goals. I'd like to give you an update on the actions we have taken to improve execution and better serve our customers. While we are pleased with our progress, we are not satisfied with our overall financial results. So I also would like to walk you through how we plan to do even more in pursuit of these goals in the coming months and how we plan to get there more quickly. We are continuing to improve execution in our distribution centers and stores, providing our customers with even lower prices and an improved shopping experience and working towards rightsizing our inventory levels.\nWithin our supply chain, we are pleased to note that our service levels, in-stock levels and on-time delivery rates from our distribution centers have all returned to the levels we saw before our capacity challenges began last year. This improvement has benefited our overall supply chain cost and has also been an important factor in positioning our stores to better serve our customers. As a result of that progress, and as we had previously announced, we accelerated our investment in incremental retail labor during the second quarter. While the investment in labor hours was initially allocated across the store base, we also strategically deployed additional hours to a set of focused stores based on the areas of greatest need and opportunity and also through high-performing teams in each district that could assist in stores where they were needed the most.\nWhile early, we are pleased with the impact of these labor investments, including the positive impact on overall customer satisfaction and store standards.\nFinally, I also want to highlight the pricing actions we completed in the second quarter as we make targeted price reductions on key items that matter most to our customers to provide them with even more affordable solutions. We have been pleased with the customer response both in terms of basket size and composition when the basket includes one of these items. These actions have further solidified our strong pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade, and we feel great about our strong value proposition.\nWith all that in mind, I want to recap some of our Q2 top line results. Net sales increased 3.9% to $9.8 billion compared to net sales of $9.4 billion in Q2 2022. Importantly, the quarter was highlighted by growth in market share of both highly consumable and nonconsumable product sales as well as accelerating unit share growth, all of which we believe is a testament to the improvements and actions I mentioned earlier. With that said, our core customers continue to tell us they feel financially constrained, which we believe contributed to a slight decrease of 0.1% in same-store sales in Q2. While customer traffic was negative during the quarter, it did improve sequentially each period. The decrease in traffic was essentially offset by an increase in average ticket, which was primarily driven by the impact of inflation.\nFrom a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest and positive in May before declining in June and July. We have seen this trend continue into August with negative comp sales through the first half of the month. This decline has been driven primarily by lower average ticket as we lap the more significant price increases from 2022. While we are not satisfied with the comp sales, we are encouraged by the improvements we saw in overall market share gains and customer traffic during the second quarter, which further support our belief that our actions are resonating with customers. However, we expect continued pressure in the sales line for the duration of this year, particularly in discretionary sales as our customer focuses more on buying for need.\nWith sales and shrink not where we want them to be, we have evolved how we are thinking about the rest of 2023. Our improved execution is driving increased customer satisfaction, and we want to accelerate this progress to serve our customers even better as we head into the holiday season as well into 2024 and beyond. As a result, we have made some important changes and have additional plans to more [indiscernible] return to the position of strength from which we are accustomed to operating, which are collectively focused on driving sales and lowering our cost to serve.\nFirst, we are strategically accelerating the rightsizing of our inventory position by expanding promotional markdowns, primarily in our non-consumable products. While we expect this to result in an operating profit headwind of approximately $95 million in the back half of the year, we believe it will drive traffic and also more quickly reduce excess inventory. We believe this rightsizing supports our operating priority of enhancing our position as a low-cost operator and that it will accelerate improvement in a number of areas, including store and supply chain efficiencies as well as shrink, damages and cash flow.\nNext, we are increasing our planned investment in incremental retail labor from approximately $100 million this year to approximately $150 million. We like the returns we have seen on this investment to date and believe that this additional investment will support acceleration of our progress and allow us to continue driving in-store improvements through the back half of the year and to begin next year in an even stronger position.\nFinally, with our strong and growing store base of nearly 20,000 [ store boards ], we also plan to invest up to $25 million in other areas such as an improved inventory demand forecasting tool to better support our stores and distribution centers while lowering our cost to serve. Collectively, we believe these investments and actions will further strengthen our position and more quickly restore the strong execution that allows us to deliver on our unique value and convenience proposition for our customers.\nImportantly, all of these actions align with and support our DG Forward strategy. We are managing this business for the long term and our mission of serving others is unchanged. Our vision for the future is clear as we seek to be a force for opportunity for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And we will focus relentlessly on delivering the value and convenience our customers expect and returning to the position of operational excellence that we expect of ourselves. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and this model is resilient and strong. We have a multitude of strategic initiatives to drive future growth, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I want to say again that all of us at Dollar General are heartbroken over the Jacksonville tragedy and our thoughts remain with all of those impacted.\nNow let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. Jeff already discussed sales so I'll start with gross profit. For Q2, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.1%, a decrease of 126 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower markups as well as increases in shrink, markdowns and inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These were partially offset by a decreased LIFO provision and decreased transportation costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 24%, an increase of 136 basis points. This increase was driven by retail labor, including approximately $40 million of our targeted labor investment as well as utilities, depreciation and amortization and rent. These were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter decreased 24.2% to $692 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.1%, a decrease of 262 basis points. Interest expense increased to $84 million in Q2 and that compares to $43 million in last year's second quarter, driven by higher average borrowings and higher interest rates. Our effective tax rate [ for the ] quarter was 22.9% and compares to 22.1% in the second quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 28.5% to $2.13.\nTurning now on to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.5 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a per store basis, which is notably lower than our increase of 14.7% on a per store basis in the first quarter. While inventory growth is still elevated, the pace has significantly moderated from its peak last year. As we discussed last quarter, we have sharpened our focus on inventory as we adjusted to evolving customer demand. We made progress towards our goal of reducing inventory growth rates by the end of the year.\nAnd with the strategic actions Jeff mentioned, we will be able to accelerate our progress by expanding promotional markdowns, primarily on nonconsumable products in the back half of the year. We expect these additional markdowns and associated costs will result in an incremental headwind of approximately $95 million to operating profit in the back half of the year. Although we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape, we also believe this is the right decision given the current environment to better support our customers, stores, distribution centers and growth plans.\nYear-to-date, through Q2, the business generated cash flows from operations of $727 million, a decrease of 23%. Total capital expenditures for the first half were $768 million and included the following: first, our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; next, distribution and transportation projects; and finally, spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of $129 million. As planned, we did not repurchase shares this quarter.\nOur capital allocation priorities have served us well for many years and continue to guide us to today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. Next, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and, over time and when appropriate, share repurchases, all while targeting a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our current investment-grade rating.\nMoving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal '23. We are updating our sales expectations for the year to reflect the softer sales trends we have seen to date as well as what we now anticipate for the back half of the year. In addition, the shrink environment has continued to worsen. We now expect approximately $100 million of additional shrink headwind since last quarter's call. While we expect this pressure to continue for the remainder of the year and recognize this is a challenge throughout retail, we are actively working to reduce these levels through multiple targeted action. These include reducing our inventory position, refreshing and refining our processes, leveraging additional tools and technology and improving execution in our stores.\nAs a result of these changes to sales and shrink and the actions and investments Jeff outlined earlier, we are updating our earnings per share guidance. We now expect the following for fiscal year 2023. Net sales growth in the range of 1.3% to 3.3% compared to our previous expectation of 3.5% to 5%. This net sales growth range continues to include an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping last year's 53rd week. Next, we expect same-store sales in the range of a decline of approximately negative 1% to growth of 1%. This compares to our previous expectation of approximately 1% to 2% growth. Finally, we expect EPS in the range of $7.10 to $8.30 or a decline of negative 34% to negative 22%. This compares to our previous expected range of an approximately 8% decline to flat year-over-year change. It also includes our actions and investments of up to $170 million or almost $0.60 of EPS.\nAdditionally, our updated guidance includes the same negative impact as our previous guidance of lapping last year's 53rd week and incurring higher interest expense this year, both negatively impacting us by 4 percentage points for a total of 8 percentage points of headwind. Our EPS continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Finally, we continue to expect a capital spending range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and no share repurchase activity.\nLet me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. While we are closely monitoring the impact of student loan repayments on our customers, our guidance does not contemplate any significant impact from the restart of these payments. With regards to our updated actions and investments that Jeff outlined, we expect the total incremental operating profit headwind of up to $170 million in the back half of the year due to the increased markdown activity, additional retail labor and investments in other areas to better support our customers, stores and distribution centers.\nIn terms of the back half of the year, we expect comp sales to be negative again in Q3 as we lap the significant price increases from 2022. And while we expect traffic trends to improve, we do not expect positive traffic until the fourth quarter. In addition, our guidance assumes that the benefit of our actions and investments will grow as we move throughout the remainder of the year, which, along with lapping the winter storm impacts from '22, should result in a greater overall sales benefit to the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect fourth quarter to be significantly better than the third quarter from both a comp sales and EPS perspective.\nTurning to gross margin for 2023. In addition to the increased markdowns associated with our inventory reduction plan and additional pressure from shrink, we also anticipate pressure from sales mix and lower inventory markups in this year's back half compared to last year. Partially offsetting these challenges, we expect benefits from greater distribution center capacity and performance, lower carrier rates expansion of our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and DG Media Network.\nTurning to SG&A. We expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollout, and we plan to make the remaining $80 million of the planned total incremental investment of approximately $150 million in our stores, primarily through additional labor hours. Overall, while our updated actions and plans for investments will pressure our financial results in 2023, we believe they will have a materially positive impact as we drive stronger in-store execution and a better customer experience. This positions us well to deliver growth in 2024 and beyond.\nIn summary, we are laser-focused on maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. And we are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffery Carl Owen\n\nCOO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Kelly. Last quarter, we introduced our DG Forward strategy, which is how we will position Dollar General to be a force for opportunity for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. DG Forward is an execution and innovation strategy, and we remain focused on driving execution through our operating priorities, including driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low-cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.\nWe will sharpen our strategic focus in 4 key ways. First, we are focused on winning in rural. Today, approximately 80% of our stores serve rural communities with fewer than 20,000 residents. Our high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to serve us well as a core strength of the business. In the second quarter, we completed 849 real estate projects, including 215 new stores, 614 remodels and 20 relocations.\nFor 2023, our plan remains to execute 3,110 real estate projects in total in the U.S., including 990 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 relocations. We now expect over 80% of our new stores in 2023 and nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional store. With regard to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which provides the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add fresh produce to many stores.\nOne way we continue to serve these locations is through DG Fresh, where our current focus is increasing sales in frozen and refrigerated categories through enhanced product offerings and building on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. During Q2, we added more than 19,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we plan to install a total of more than 65,000 incremental cooler doors in 2023. And while produce is not currently serviced by our internal supply chain, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. We know this offering is important to customers, especially in rural areas. And at the end of Q2, we offered fresh produce in more than 4,400 stores with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 5,000 stores by the end of 2023.\nImportantly, despite the meaningful improvements we've made and savings we have realized to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have an opportunity to drive significant additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead.\nOur second focus area as we move DG Forward is extending our reach. We are striving to expand the DG universe by attracting and serving new customers through new formats, while also reaching existing customers in unique and differentiated ways. Starting with our digital initiative, where we are investing to further extend our digital front porch to build even deeper connections and extend our reach beyond our substantial physical brick-and-mortar footprint. We are excited about the growth we're seeing across our digital properties, including an increase of more than 20% in monthly active users since this time last year.\nFurther, we are seeing tremendous success through our partnership with DoorDash, which is now available in more than 15,000 stores and continues to drive significant incremental transactions with customers. Our DG Media Network is also extending our reach with customers with a more personalized experience while delivering a higher return on ad spend for our partners and profitable growth for our business. Overall, our digital strategy consists of building an ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\nNext, we extended our reach beyond the borders for the first time earlier this year with the opening of our first [ Mi Super ] Dollar General store in Monterrey, Mexico. We continue to be very encouraged by the customer response and the early results, which include sales results that are significantly exceeding our initial expectations. Looking ahead, our updated goal is to have up to 10 stores serving underserved communities in Northern Mexico by the end of 2023 as we look to leverage our brand awareness while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States.\nThe third way we are extending our reach is through our pOpshelf format which is now nearly 3 years old. This format provides a stress-free, guilt-free shopping experience designed around nonconsumable shopping occasions. During the quarter, we opened 26 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 190 at the end of Q2 located within 20 states. We are continuing to refine the ideal layout and assortment for these stores, and we have actively leveraged our learnings to develop our 3.0 version, which will begin rolling out next month.\nLooking ahead, we are taking a balanced approach to opening the right number of new pOpshelf stores in the right locations in this macroeconomic environment and expects to operate a total of approximately 230 stores by the end of 2023. Importantly, we still believe pOpshelf adds approximately 3,000 opportunities to our total addressable market over the long term, and we remain excited about the growth opportunity.\nFinally, we are extending our reach through our health initiative branded as DG Well-being. Our customer research continues to show that not only are our rural communities underserved with basic staple offerings, but they also have trouble accessing health care goods and services. In response, we continue to focus on rolling out an expanded health care product assortment, which was available in nearly 6,000 stores at the end of Q2, and we now plan to expand to a total of more than 7,000 stores by the end of 2023.\nLooking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering and also of our partnership with a third-party payment platform to allow customers to use health plan supplemental benefits to purchase various health and wellness-related items in their local Dollar General stores. This health benefit option is now available in approximately 13,000 stores but the goal of being available chain-wide by the end of the year as we continue to focus on increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America.\nOur third area of strategic focus is to fuel our growth. These efforts are comprised of strengthening and modernizing 3 critical components to improve execution: our supply chain, our operating model and our IT foundation. We plan to fuel our best-in-class growth by investing in high-return projects and resources to enable our team to execute at the highest levels to serve our customers. Within our supply chain, we have made significant progress adding capacity and increasing the productivity and efficiency of operations within our distribution centers. And with 3 additional facilities under construction in Colorado, Arkansas and Oregon, we are on pace to add significant incremental capacity in 2024.\nFurthermore, we recently went live in South Carolina with our first distribution center to feature large-scale automation to replenish stores. Once fully ramped, this automation will be able to deliver half of the SKUs served from this facility to over 1,000 stores. Ultimately, this will allow the team to process thousands of additional SKUs while improving our storage per square foot inside the facility and lowering our cost to serve. We are excited about this opportunity to support our growth more effectively and efficiently and look forward to adding automated functionality to more facilities moving forward.\nWe also continue to expand our private tractor fleet, which consisted of more than 1,800 tractors at the end of Q2 and accounted for nearly 50% of our outbound transportation needs. As a reminder, we save approximately 20% of associated costs every time we replace a third-party tractor with one from our private fleet. Looking ahead, we plan to have more than 2,000 tractors in our private fleet by the end of 2023. These efforts have been and will continue to be an important driver in lowering our overall transportation costs.\nWithin our stores, we are intensely focused on reducing complexity to create a better in-store experience for customers and associates. We have simplified operations by optimizing our rolltainer delivery and rolling out self-checkout option, which was available in nearly 14,000 stores at the end of Q2.\nFinally, over the past year, we have been working to implement a full end-to-end transformation of our retail operating model, its first major overhaul in nearly 20 years. We recently launched the pilot of this model, and while it's still very early, we believe this will significantly enhance the in-store experience for our teams while also further enhancing our position as a low-cost operator. We will have more to share on this in the coming months, but we are excited about this opportunity as we leverage enhanced technology and innovation to further support and fuel our growth in the years ahead.\nThe fourth area of focus with DG Forward is that it's all powered by our people. The strength of our people was on display recently as we hosted more than 1,500 leaders of our company in Nashville, for our annual leadership meeting. This is my favorite week of the year, and I was once again inspired and humbled by the commitment of our people to move DG Forward while fulfilling our mission of Serving Others every day. The people of Dollar General are our greatest strategic advantage. And to further enhance our position, we are investing in our people and creating opportunities for growth and development and amplifying our culture where our people can enjoy a meaningful career where the work they do every day makes a difference.\nOur commitment to growth and development is as strong as ever. And with our robust footprint, ongoing growth and strong sense of purpose, we believe there's no better place to start and develop a career than with Dollar General. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust, as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 70% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, more than 10% of our growing private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We continue to have great success hiring the talent we need and we are pleased with our staffing levels and applicant flow.\nWe often note that our customer experience at Dollar General will never exceed the experience of our associates, and we are committed to continuing to elevate the experience for our people as they power our DG Forward strategy.\nIn closing, I want to thank our more than 185,000 employees for their commitment and hard work to serve our customers and the communities we call home. Dollar General is an essential part of small towns across America that form the backbone of our country, and we are focused on serving our customers with value and convenience they deserve every day. We are taking the actions and making the investments we believe are necessary to accelerate our progress and return even more quickly to executing with the operational excellence that has long been a hallmark of this company. The opportunities ahead of us are significant, and we are excited about the steps we're taking to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value.\nWith that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffery Carl Owen\n\nCOO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. In addition to our first quarter results and updated outlook for 2023, we'll spend our time this morning discussing the significant progress we have made on multiple fronts, including improving execution in our distribution centers and stores, an update on the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment and the important actions we are taking to support our customers.\nDespite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than previously anticipated, which has negatively impacted our sales and full year EPS outlooks, we are confident in Dollar General's ability to deliver strong and sustainable growth in the years ahead. As a reminder, Dollar General is uniquely positioned at the intersection of value and convenience. Regarding value, although we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors as well as other classes of trade, we are always looking for ways to better serve our customers and provide them with the items they need at prices they can afford. And right now, we believe our customers need Dollar General more than ever.\nAs it relates to convenience, with more than 19,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide our customers with convenient access to everyday household essentials, particularly in rural America. We delivered progress across multiple fronts in Q1, including our supply chain recovery efforts as we ended the quarter with our best distribution center service levels in nearly 2 years.\nWith our previously announced investment in incremental store labor hours, we continue to enhance the customer experience, including a material improvement in customer satisfaction scores since prior year-end. And while we are pleased with our progress on these fronts, we are focusing even more structurally, strategically and operationally on serving our core customer. I'll provide more details on these actions in a moment.\nBut first, let me provide some details on our Q1 results. The quarter was highlighted by same-store sales growth of 4.3% in our consumables category. This increase was partially offset by a decline of 8.5% in our combined nonconsumable categories as customers continue to shift more of their spending away from discretionary goods. Overall, we had softer-than-expected sales in the quarter, which we believe was primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, including headwinds from lower tax refunds than customers expected and reductions in SNAP benefits as well as unfavorable weather during the months of March and April.\nRegarding tax refunds, we believe our customers were caught offguard by the reduced amounts, which exacerbated the inflationary pressures they were already experiencing. Our customers typically use these refunds to repay debt, purchase big ticket items, make repairs, build a safety net in savings or a combination thereof. The changes this year are contributing to their financial insecurity, and many are using lower refunds to simply afford basic household essentials while others are contracting their overall spending.\nTurning to SNAP. As we mentioned on our Q4 2022 call, we did not see a notable sales impact in states that eliminated the emergency allotment early. Instead, our data suggests that customers who used SNAP simply made up the difference in their basket with another form of tender. However, in the states where reductions occurred in March of this year, we have seen an impact to sales as our customers appear to primarily have reduced the size of their basket instead of using other forms of tender to complete their purchases at the same level. Additionally, these and other customers appear to be shopping closer to payday. Finally, like other retailers, the cold and rainy weather also had a negative impact on our top line performance, particularly in March and April, which created a slow start to the spring season.\nNow let me recap some additional financial results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 6.8% to $9.3 billion and same-store sales increased 1.6%. Our same-store sales results were driven by increased basket size, partially offset by a decrease in customer traffic. While we gained market share in nonconsumables again this quarter, our share in consumables was essentially flat as we believe the macro headwinds have had a disproportionate impact on our core customer.\nFrom a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in February at 4.8% and ahead of our expectations. We continue to see positive results from March at 2.2% growth, even though the back half of the month was impacted by the headwinds I mentioned earlier. This pressure continued into April, resulting in a same-store sales decline of 2% for the last month of the quarter. This pressure has continued into May, as we continue to see sales performance below the expectations contemplated in our initial financial guidance for the year.\nHowever, as our actions have begun to take hold, we have seen an encouraging uptick with positive comp sales through the first 3 weeks of the quarter as well as gains in our most recent market share results. As a result of these headwinds and the impact on our top line performance as well as an increasingly challenging shrink environment, we are revising our outlook for the year, which Kelly will discuss in more detail shortly.\nTurning to our customer, who is under greater pressure than we have seen in quite some time. In addition to the ongoing mix shift I mentioned earlier, we continue to see signs of increasing financial strain on our customers as they seek affordable options, including increased reliance on private brands and items at or below the $1 price point. Being there for our customer is our most important calling at Dollar General. And while past experience suggests our customers will adjust their budgets after a couple of quarters, we are taking action now to better support them both in the near and longer term.\nFirst and foremost, we are taking action to provide even more affordable solutions and lower prices for our customers. We are doing this in a targeted fashion on the items that matter most as we believe we can be even sharper within our established target range. Next, we are leaning into our Save to Serve approach as we evaluate opportunities to take costs out of the business while pursuing efficiencies in our cost structure that will allow us to reduce spending without impacting the customer experience.\nWe are also refining our inventory management process, including making some structural reporting realignments within our team to allow us to move more nimbly to respond to customer demand and the needs of the business. Finally, we are prioritizing and optimizing our capital expenditures to maintain flexibility and enhance our focus on the core business. Included in these plans, we have made the decision to moderate our rollout of pOpshelf in 2023 as we now plan to open approximately 90 stores compared to our original expectation of approximately 150 openings. We believe this is a prudent reduction based on the current environment. And as other retailers navigate what this environment means for their businesses, we believe there may be more favorable real estate opportunities to come.\nWhile we are operating in a different and more challenging environment than previously anticipated, we believe we are taking the right actions to serve our customers and communities. And we know that taking care of our customer is not only the right decision for the near term but that it will prove to be the right answer for the long term as well. Despite the near-term headwinds, this business model, which has proven to be successful in a variety of economic environments, remains very strong.\nAnd we have multiple strategic initiatives in place to drive future growth while also distancing and differentiating our model from others in the discount retail space. We have a clear vision to be a force for opportunity, which I will discuss in greater detail in a few minutes. And most importantly, our mission of serving others is unchanged and is our north star regardless of the external environment.\nI also want to highlight that we recently published our fifth annual Serving Others report, which provides updates on our ongoing ESG efforts. Finally, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate John Garratt on his retirement. John is with us in the room today, and I just want to publicly thank him for his service to our customers, employees and shareholders. He has been a wonderful business partner, and we will certainly miss him.\nWith that said, I also want to congratulate Kelly Dilts on her promotion to Chief Financial Officer. Kelly has provided meaningful leadership since joining our team in 2019 and has worked closely with John and myself during this transition process. I am confident she will continue to elevate our team while driving the strong financial discipline we are committed to at Dollar General. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kelly.\n\nKelly M. Dilts\n\nSenior VP, Finance & IR, Tailored Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank John for his outstanding leadership during his time at Dollar General as well as for his mentorship as I step into this role. It's a tremendous honor to serve as CFO of this great company and work with this incredible team to serve our customers. I'm excited about the opportunity we have in front of us as we drive growth and create long-term shareholder value.\nNow that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nJeff has already discussed sales so I'll start with gross profit. For Q1, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, an increase of 34 basis points. This was primarily attributable to higher inventory markup, decreased transportation costs and a decreased LIFO provision. These were partially offset by increases in shrink, markdowns and inventory damages as well as a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.7%, an increase of 94 basis points. This increase was driven by certain expenses that were a greater percentage of sales in the current year period, the most significant of which were retail labor, including a $27 million targeted incremental labor hour investment as well as repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization. These were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter decreased 0.7% to $741 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.9%, a decrease of 60 basis points. Interest expense increased to $83 million in Q1 compared to $40 million in the first quarter of '22, primarily driven by higher average borrowings and higher interest rates. Our effective tax rate for both this quarter and the first quarter of '22 was 21.8%. The effective income tax rate was flat due to a lower state effective tax rate, offset by a reduced benefit from stock-based compensation compared to the first quarter of '22. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 2.9% to $2.34.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.3 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 14.7% on a per-store basis. This increase continues to reflect the impact of product cost inflation. While inventory growth is still elevated, the pace has moderated from its peak last year. Looking ahead, we plan to further sharpen our focus on inventory as we adjust to an evolving customer demand, and we continue to anticipate more normalized growth rates as we move through the back half of the year. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape.\nDuring Q1, the business generated cash flows from operations of $191 million, a decrease of 57%, which was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels. Total capital expenditures were $363 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of $129 million. As planned, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter.\nOur capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. Next, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through quarterly dividend payments and, over time and when appropriate, share repurchases, all while targeting a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our current investment-grade credit rating.\nMoving to an update on our financial outlook for the fiscal 2023 year. As Jeff noted, we're seeing a much more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated, and this is having a significant impact on our customer spending levels and behavior. We're taking swift and decisive action to adjust to this environment while maintaining our ability to save our customers both time and money. We remain confident in the business and our long-term growth prospects.\nIn the near term, we are revising our outlook for 2023 to reflect those headwinds, and we now expect the following: first, net sales growth in the range of approximately 3.5% to 5% compared to our previous expectation of 5.5% to 6%. Both of these include an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping 2022's 53rd week. Next, same-store sales growth is expected to be in the range of approximately 1% to approximately 2%. This compares to our previous expectation of 3% to 3.5%. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of an approximate 8% decline to flat. This compares to our previous expectation of growth in the range of approximately 4% to 6%. Both of these ranges include an estimated negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points due to lapping 2022's 53rd week.\nThe updated diluted EPS guidance also includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points due to higher interest expense in fiscal 2023. This compares to the anticipated negative impact of approximately 3 percentage points included in the prior EPS guidance. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. This compares to our previous assumption in the range of 22.5% to 23%.\nWe now expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion compared to our previous expectation of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, all of which include the impact of significant inflation in the cost of certain building materials, construction of new distribution centers and continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital expenditures. Our current expectations do reflect reductions in spending that we believe are prudent while we continue to prioritize meeting the needs of the business and supporting our ongoing growth.\nFinally, in order to maintain financial flexibility and stay in line with our goal to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and our associated debt leverage ratio target, we do not plan to repurchase shares in 2023. This compares to our previous expectation to repurchase a total of approximately $500 million of our common stock.\nLet me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we anticipate the EPS decline to be the most significant in the second quarter as a result of continued financial strain on our customer as well as lapping our strongest quarterly gross margin performance from 2022. We are also pulling forward a larger portion of our labor investment and anticipate more than $40 million of the investment will be made in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter to be our strongest quarter from both a comp sales and EPS growth perspective as we anticipate a benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impact as well as generating momentum from the actions we're taking this year as we head into 2024.\nOur sales guidance assumes our customer will remain under pressure for the remainder of the year. While we believe they will ultimately adjust their budgets and recover, the depth and the duration of the current pressure is difficult to predict. Additionally, while we have attracted and retained a significant number of customers in higher income brackets in recent years, our guidance does not assume a significant trade in benefit for this year.\nTurning now to gross margin for 2023. In addition to the material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of '22, we expect the benefits from greater distribution center capacity and performance, lower carrier rates, expansion of our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh. Furthermore, we continue to anticipate a significant contribution from our DG Media Network. Partially offsetting some of these expected benefits are increased inventory shrink as well as pressure from sales mix and higher markdowns throughout the remainder of the year.\nRegarding SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollout. However, in the aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2023 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. And we plan to continue making the remainder of the planned total incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores, primarily through additional labor hours. And as I just noted, we expect this investment to be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. While this investment will pressure SG&A in 2023, we believe it's the right thing to do for the business, and it will drive stronger in-store execution, positioning us well to serve our customers even better. Finally, we also expect a headwind from higher interest expense over the next couple of quarters.\nIn closing, we are grateful for the team's hard work as we strive to deliver for our customers. We're sharpening our focus and continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in the long term. Finally, we're confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffery Carl Owen\n\nCOO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Kelly. We have a clear vision for the future of this company, which is to be a force for opportunity for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders. To bring this vision to life in the years ahead, we have developed a strategic framework to serve as our road map into the future. I want to briefly introduce this framework today and we'll provide further detail and updates in the quarters ahead.\nWe call this road map DG Forward, and it is focused on the powerful combination of execution and innovation. For us, our execution is driven by our operating priorities. While these priorities are not changing, we are going to sharpen our strategic focus in 4 key ways. First, we are going to focus even more on rural by doubling down on serving and providing our rural customers with what they need when they need it. This company was founded to serve the underserved, and today, approximately 80% of our stores, many of which are in rural America, serve communities with fewer than 20,000 residents.\nSecond, we are going to extend our reach. We will focus on expanding the DG universe by serving new customers through new formats or existing customers in new and differentiated ways. Third, we are going to fuel our growth by strengthening and modernizing 3 critical components to improve execution: our operating model, our supply chain and our IT foundation. We will fuel our best-in-class growth by investing in resources to enable our team to execute at the highest levels to serve our customers.\nThe fourth and most important area of focus with DG Forward is that it's all powered by our people. We believe Dollar General is truly powered by the best team in retail, and we are leaning into 3 specific areas to double down on this strategic advantage: investing in our people and creating opportunities for growth and development, amplifying our culture and reinforcing Dollar General as a destination for starting, growing and enjoying a meaningful career where the work we do every day makes a difference.\nThis DG Forward framework is the lens through which we see the future of this company, and we are excited about what lies ahead. You will hear more from us in the quarters ahead about some of the innovation that is well underway, but I want to spend our last few minutes providing a quick update on how we are executing through our operating priorities. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We continue to focus on providing value to customers in nonconsumable categories through our NCI offering in Dollar General stores as well as through the treasure hunt experience in our stand-alone pOpshelf format.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 24 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 164 at the end of Q1, located in 16 states. While sales in this economic environment are softer than our earlier results, we continue to be pleased with the customer response. Looking ahead, we are taking a balanced approach to opening the right number of new pOpshelf stores in the right locations in this environment and now expect to operate a total of approximately 230 stores by the end of 2023. As a result of our slower pace of openings, we are reevaluating our plans with regards to our timing of reaching 1,000 stores by the end of 2025 and plan to provide an updated expectation at a later date. Importantly, we still believe pOpshelf adds approximately 3,000 opportunities to our total addressable market over the long term, and we remain as excited as ever about the growth opportunity.\nTurning now to DG Fresh, which has delivered significant cost savings while enhancing the profitability of our perishables offering. Our current area of focus for DG Fresh is increasing sales in frozen and refrigerated categories through enhanced product offerings and building on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. During Q1, we added more than 18,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we plan to install a total of more than 65,000 incremental cooler doors in 2023. And while produce is not currently serviced by our internal supply chain, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time.\nTo that end, at the end of Q1, we offered fresh produce in nearly 3,900 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 5,000 stores by the end of 2023. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made and savings that we have realized to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have an opportunity to drive significant additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead.\nTurning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. Our expanded health assortment offering was available in nearly 5,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we now plan to expand to a total of more than 7,000 stores by the end of 2023. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering and also of our partnership with a third-party payment platform to allow customers to use health plan supplemental benefits to purchase various health and wellness-related items in their local Dollar General stores.\nThis health benefit option is now available in approximately 7,500 stores, with the goal of being available chain-wide by the end of the year as we continue to focus on increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. In addition to these initiatives, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including supply chain efficiencies, private brand enhancements and improvements in global sourcing.\nOur second priority is capturing growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, our high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to serve us well as a core strength of the business. In the first quarter, we completed more than 800 real estate projects, including 212 new stores, 582 remodels and 22 relocations. For 2023, we are revising our real estate plans to reflect the reduced pace of pOpshelf opening. We now plan to execute 3,110 real estate projects in total in the U.S., including 990 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 relocations. We continue to expect approximately 80% of our new stores and nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional store.\nWith regard to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which provides the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add fresh produce in many stores. In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we opened our first Mi Súper Dollar General store in Monterrey, Mexico in Q1. We have been very encouraged by the customer response and the early results, which include sales results that are exceeding our pro forma expectations. Looking ahead, our goal is to have up to 20 stores serving the underserved communities in northern Mexico by the end of 2023 as we look to leverage our brand awareness while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States.\nNext, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. We are extending our reach in a variety of important ways, including driving customer engagement through our app and extending our partnership with DoorDash, which is now available in more than 14,800 stores.\nOur DG Media Network provides another important avenue of growth as we seek to connect our unique rural-based customer network with CPG companies and brands to deliver a more personalized experience for our customers, a higher return on ad spend for our partners and profitable growth for our business. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\nOur third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Kelly and her team are rigorously applying our Save to Serve lens to the business to guide our approach to keeping costs low for our customer. As she discussed, we will be particularly focused on managing expenses this year without compromising long-term growth. We continue to focus on driving efficiencies in the organization, including through our Fast Track initiative. The current phase of this initiative is focused on self-checkout, which provides customers with even greater convenience in our stores. This offering was available in approximately 12,600 stores at the end of Q1, and we are on track to be in more than 14,000 stores by the end of 2023 as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail.\nWe also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private tractor fleet, which consisted of more than 1,700 tractors at the end of Q1 and accounted for approximately 45% of our outbound transportation needs. Looking ahead, we plan to have more than 2,000 tractors in our private fleet by the end of 2023, which would account for more than 50% of our outbound transportation fleet. Overall, we are taking action to drive efficiencies and drive cost savings as our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\nOur fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As I mentioned within our DG Forward framework, everything we do at this company is powered by our people, and we continue to focus on creating opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 70% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, more than 10% of our growing private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center.\nWe continue to have great success hiring the talent we need and we are pleased with our staffing levels and average [indiscernible]. Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is what sets Dollar General apart from our competition and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\nJust recently, we added to the strength of our executive team with the promotion of Steve Deckard to Executive Vice President of Growth in Emerging Markets, where he will oversee our real estate, data science, pOpshelf, Mexico and DG Wellbeing teams. His position will facilitate an even sharper organizational focus on driving execution in our core business while also innovating for the future. And there is no one better suited for this role than Steve, who has been a key strategic leader with Dollar General for 17 years, most recently leading our international expansion in Mexico. I look forward to his continued leadership and ongoing contributions to our success.\nIn closing, we are focused on delivering our DG Forward strategy to be a force for opportunity for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders. We believe our short-term adjustments position us well to serve our customers in this environment, and our execution on our initiatives and operating priorities positions us well to drive long-term growth. I want to thank our more than 175,000 employees for their diligence and dedication to fulfilling our mission of Serving Others every day. Our customers and communities need Dollar General right now, and we are poised and ready to serve when and where they need us most. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

My name is Robert, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Dollar General's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 16, 2023. (Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference.\n\nKevin Walker\n\nVP of IR, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Jeff Owen, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News and Events.\nLet me caution you that today's comments include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements about our financial guidance, strategy initiatives, plans, goals, priorities, opportunities, investments, expectations or beliefs about future matters and other statements that are not limited to historical fact.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, those identified in our earnings release issued this morning, under Risk Factors in our 2021 Form 10-K filed on March 18, 2022, and any later filed periodic report and in the comments that are made on this call.\nYou should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in the call unless required by law. (Operator Instructions) Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffery Carl Owen\n\nCEO & Director, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their dedication to serving our customers and communities this year. I am inspired by this team's commitment to our mission of serving others and the passion they have for helping our customers save time and money every day.\nOur fourth quarter performance was led by strong comp sales growth of 5.7%. And while this result was below our expectations, our performance included market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and contributed to a net sales increase of 17.9% to $10.2 billion.\nOur Q4 comp sales were driven by an increase in average basket size, primarily attributable to inflation and partially offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic, primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic in late December. And similar to recent quarters, average units per basket were down. Notably, both November and January comp sales at 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively, were within our expected range of 6% to 7% for the quarter. However, our December sales performance was negatively impacted by winter storm Elliott, which had the most significant effect on our stores in the final days leading up to Christmas. The quarter was also impacted by greater-than-anticipated inventory damages, which contributed to diluted EPS results that were below our expectations.\nWhile the storm had some damages impact, we also incurred higher damages than expected as we work through the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related store and distribution inefficiencies we experienced during the second half of the year. Although we expect some of these related impacts to be with us through the end of Q1, we are pleased to have the storage capacity constraints largely behind us, which we believe positions us well moving forward.\nTurning to a few highlights of the 2022 fiscal year. Net sales increased 10.6% to $37.8 billion and included a benefit of approximately 2 percentage points or $678 million in sales from the 53rd week. Comp sales for the year increased 4.3%, driven by strong growth in basket size. Although a significant portion of the basket growth was attributable to inflation, we were pleased to see an average basket size at the end of the year of more than five items and nearly $17.\nThe team accomplished a great deal in 2022, and we closed the year with significant progress on our strategic initiatives and operating priorities while achieving several key milestones in Q4 and the weeks thereafter.\nWe were particularly excited to celebrate the opening of our 19,000 store in Joplin, Missouri in January, as we continue to support our customers with our unique combination of value and convenience in their hometown communities. We also completed the initial rollout of our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI with the offering now in nearly all of our stores across the chain.\nFinally, we made strong progress in our supply chain, reducing our storage capacity constraints and improving operations during the quarter. More specifically, and as we said we would do, we added significant capacity in Q4, bringing nearly 3 million square feet of distribution capacity online. These efforts culminated with the opening of our newest distribution center in Blair, Nebraska during the quarter.\nI also want to highlight that we have started 2023 with the opening of our first store in Mexico. And while the store has only been open a few short weeks, we are very encouraged by the early response from our new customers. These achievements are a testament to this team's hard work and continued focus on execution and innovation as we continue to deliver on our mission of serving others.\nTurning now to an update on our customers. In addition to adjusting the mix of their baskets, we continue to see customers shift spending to more affordable options, including our private brands, which represent more than 20% of our total sales. Within consumables, private brand growth, both in absolute dollars and penetration was the highest in the fourth quarter. We also increased our share of wallet and share of trips across all segments of our core customer in Q4, and we believe we will be increasingly important to them in the year ahead.\nWith regard to trade-in behavior, customers and income brackets above our core customers are shopping with us at an increasing rate, underscoring our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers.\nWe remain focused on our goal to be priced at relative parity with mass merchants and we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and all classes of trade. Furthermore, given the strong demand from customers, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point. Notably, during Q4, our comp sales were over 30% in our Value Valley set, which is comprised entirely of items at the $1 price point.\nOverall, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of this program and the value it offers to our customers. In addition, we believe we are well positioned to continue serving both new and existing customers, and we are moving with great intentionality to build on our momentum.\nTo this end, we are excited about our plans for 2023. Building on the investments we made in 2022, we plan to make a larger targeted incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores this year. This investment will primarily consist of incremental labor hours to support our expectations regarding consistent store standards while further enhancing the associate and customer experience.\nIn turn, we believe this investment will position us to drive greater on-shelf availability and capture additional market share while amplifying the potential of our initiatives and ensuring our readiness for our growing customer base.\nAnd with the progress we have made in the supply chain, the prior investments we have made in wages, and the growing customer engagement we are seeing, we believe we are well positioned to see a meaningful return on this investment. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our innovation will continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape.\nIn summary, we are excited about our plans to deliver strong growth in 2023 while also making significant and deliberate investments in the business. We believe our customer and communities will need us even more as we move throughout 2023. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we are well positioned to serve them while also creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn W. Garratt\n\nPresident & CFO, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nAs Jeff already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.9%, a decrease of 35 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increased LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, and increases in inventory shrink, damages and markdowns, partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in transportation costs. Of note, product cost inflation continued as a significant headwind, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $164 million during the quarter and approximately $517 million for the full year.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.7%, a decrease of 29 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail occupancy costs, incentive compensation and retail labor. These were partially offset by certain expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales in the current year period primarily utilities.\nMoving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 17.1% to $933 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.1%, a decrease of 6 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to decreased income tax benefits associated with the stock-based compensation compared to 2021. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $2.96. For the full year, EPS increased 5% to $10.68 and included an estimated positive impact of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders.\nMerchandise inventories were $6.8 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 20.4% overall and 14.3% on a per store basis. This increase continues to reflect the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of NCI as well as the earlier receipt of seasonal goods. While inventory growth is still elevated, the pace is moderating as we expected. Notably, our Q4 inventory growth rate per store was essentially half of what it was in Q3. Looking ahead, we anticipate more normalized growth rates as we move through 2023.\nImportantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. In 2022, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $2 billion, a decrease of 31%, which was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels. Total capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution, transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $121 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives.\nWe also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\nMoving to our financial outlook for the fiscal 2023 year. We anticipate the challenging economic and operating environment to continue into 2023, but we believe we are well positioned to drive strong growth as we move throughout the year. For 2023, we are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on February 23, 2023, and providing additional financial guidance to include the following expectations.\nNet sales growth in the range of approximately 5.5% to 6%, including an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week; same-store sales growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%; and EPS growth in the range of approximately 4% to 6%, including estimated negative impacts of approximately 3 percentage points due to higher interest expense and approximately 4 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week.\nOur EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, which includes the impact of significant inflation in the cost of certain building materials, construction of new distribution centers and continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.\nWith regard to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved an increased quarterly dividend payment of $0.59 per share. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $500 million of our common stock this year. This is a lower amount as compared to the recent years but consistent with our capital allocation priorities and reflects our commitment to our current credit rating, our continued strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business.\nLet me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half compared to the first half. This is due in part to our expectation of continued headwinds from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through the first half of the year. We anticipate certain of these headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1, including an estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense of approximately $40 million, inventory damages and residual impacts of the storage capacity constraints and related inefficiencies that Jeff mentioned earlier.\nIn addition, we expect the year-over-year net impact of the labor investment to be most significant in Q1 as we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2, and we believe the benefits of the incremental labor will become more significant later in the year. As we move into the back half, we also anticipate a benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022.\nTurning now to gross margin for 2023. In addition to the material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of 2022, we expect significant benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates, expansion of our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies.\nWe also expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. Furthermore, we anticipate a significant contribution from our DG Media Network, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a moment. Partially offsetting some of these expected benefits are the anticipated sales mix pressure and increased inventory shrink and damages I mentioned as well as increased markdowns as we return to rates more in line with the historic norms.\nWith regard to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2023, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. And as Jeff noted, we plan to make an incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores, primarily through additional labor hours. While this investment will pressure SG&A in 2023, we believe it is the right thing for the business and will drive stronger in-store execution, positioning us well to build on the momentum we have with our customers.\nWe expect a headwind from inflationary pressures in our business. So we continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track.\nIn closing, we are grateful for the team's hard work to deliver for our customers in 2022. Looking ahead, we are excited about our growth plans for 2023, including strong sales and operating profit while simultaneously making significant and deliberate investments in the business.\nAs always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffery Carl Owen\n\nCEO & Director, Dollar General Corporation\n\nThank you, John. Let me take a few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, which have transformed this company in recent years, resulting in strong growth and enhanced profitability.\nOur first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. Starting with NCI. With the initial rollout phase now complete, we will focus on continuing to refine the assortment and enhance the treasure hunt offering to provide value to our customers in the nonconsumable categories. Overall, we are very pleased with the success of NCI including market share gains in nonconsumable sales in Q4.\nMoving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 37 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 140 at the end of 2022, located within 14 states.\nWhile sales in this economic environment have been somewhat softer than our earlier results, we continue to be pleased with the customer response. Looking ahead, we plan to more than double the pOpshelf shell store count in 2023, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to nearly 300 by year-end, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025.\nTurning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. We are now delivering perishable products to more than 19,000 stores from 12 facilities, and we continue to be pleased with the cost savings from this initiative and importantly, the significantly enhanced profitability of our perishables offering.\nIn addition to capturing cost savings, DG Fresh also aims to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during 2022.\nGoing forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of 2022, we offered fresh produce in more than 3,200 stores with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 5,000 stores by the end of 2023.\nFinally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2022, we added more than 66,000 cooler doors across our store base. And we plan to install a similar number of cooler doors in 2023. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made and savings we realized to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have an opportunity to drive significant additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead.\nTurning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. As a reminder, the initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 4,400 stores at the end of 2022, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 5,500 stores by the end of 2023.\nLooking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering and testing of our mobile clinic with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately, services over time, particularly in rural America.\nFinally, we also plan to make significant enhancements to our private brand offering in 2023 as we know how important these value offerings are for our customers. We are increasing private brand offerings across many important categories, including candy and snacks, perishables, pet food and over-the-counter health care products. We believe these products will further differentiate Dollar General in the marketplace as we look to provide our customers with tremendous value on quality products.\nIn addition to the initiatives I just discussed, as well as the anticipated supply chain efficiencies I mentioned earlier, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in global sourcing as well as shrink and damage reduction.\nOur second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2022, we completed a total of 2,961 real estate projects, including 1,039 new stores, 1,795 remodels and 127 relocations.\nFor 2023, our goal remains to execute approximately 3,170 real estate projects in the United States across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 store relocations. Notably, this would be the most real estate projects we have executed in 1 year.\nOur ability to innovate on the store formats continues to be an important strength for the business, and we expect to leverage multiple formats to drive strong returns in the year ahead. Approximately 80% of our new stores in nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional store.\nWith regard to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which provides the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add fresh produce in many stores.\nIn addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are excited about our international expansion. We were pleased to open our first Mi Super Dollar General in Monterrey, Mexico last month, and we have been very encouraged by the customer response and community reception we have seen so far.\nLooking ahead, our goal is to have approximately 20 stores serving underserved communities in Northern Mexico by the end of 2023 as we look to leverage our brand awareness while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States.\nOverall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.\nNext, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2022 with approximately 4.5 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to continue to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings.\nOur partnership with DoorDash continues to serve us as an important extension of the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. DoorDash is available in nearly 14,000 stores, and we anticipate extending this offering to an additional 1,000 stores in 2023. We are pleased with the incremental sales growth attributed to this partnership as well as its profitability, and we believe we have an opportunity to drive even stronger growth moving forward.\nIn addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique customer profiles, especially rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country. We expect our DG Media Network to grow significantly in 2023 as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while substantially increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business.\nOverall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\nOur third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset.\nOur Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach. The first phase of this initiative, which included rolltainer optimization and self-checkout is focused on enhancing customer convenience and labor productivity in our stores. Self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, was available in more than 11,000 stores at the end of 2022, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates.\nLooking ahead, our goal is to have a self-checkout offering in more than 13,000 stores by the end of 2023, including the full self-checkout option in more than 2,000 stores as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail.\nMoving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consist of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams while laying the foundation for additional phases of Fast Track in the future.\nWe also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private tractor fleet, which is one of the largest private retail fleets in the U.S. Our fleet consisted of more than 1,600 tractors at the end of 2022 and accounted for more than 40% of our outbound transportation needs. Looking ahead, we plan to have more than 2,000 tractors in our private fleet by the end of 2023, which would account for more than 50% of our outbound transportation fleet.\nOverall, our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\nOur fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created more than 10,000 new jobs in 2022, while continuing to drive opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 70% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, more than 10% of our growing private fleet team, which nearly doubled in size in 2022, began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center.\nWe continue to have great success hiring the talent we need, and we are pleased with our staffing levels and applicant flow. Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is what sets Dollar General apart from the competition and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\nWe added incredible individuals across the organization in 2022 as we grew teams in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center, while also adding a local team in Mexico to support our new customers in those communities.\nIn addition to new opportunities, we have made significant investments in our people, including raising average hourly retail wages by approximately 23% over the last 3 years and investing over 4 million training hours in 2022 to promote education and development. The people of Dollar General are our greatest strength and the driving force of this company.\nIn closing, we made great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2022, while making a difference in the lives of our customers. As we enter 2023, we are excited about our robust plans for growth, which we believe will further enhance our ability to serve our customers in meaningful ways. We are the innovation leader in our space, and we are laser-focused on executing at a high level to continue driving long-term sustainable growth while delivering strong returns for our shareholders.\nFinally, I want to thank more than 170,000 employees for their commitment to serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in 2023.\nWith that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.",

I will now hand over to Mr. Gregoire Thibault, Head of Investor Relations of VINCI. Sir, go ahead.\n\nGregoire Thibault\n\nGroup Director of IR & Financial Communications, VINCI SA\n\nGood evening, and thanks, everybody, for attending this conference call. And today with Maria (inaudible), Head of Corporate Controlling and Accounting; Christophe Ferrer, Head of Group Cash Management and Financing, online team, [Boris Vale and Marie Richard].\nAs usual, I will try to be brief to have more time for the Q&A. What are the key takeaways of this publication. First, a solid operating performance in Q3 across all our business lines. For VINCI Autoroutes, the traffic was above its pre-pandemic levels. For VINCI Airports, the recovery in passenger number accelerated.\nFor VINCI Energies, Cobra IS and VINCI Construction, a strong business and order intake momentum. I will give you more granularity by division later in my presentation. All in all, Q3 total revenue was EUR 16.7 billion, up 26% year-on-year and plus 12% like-for-like, down in line with the trend of H1.\nIndeed, in the first 9 months of 2022, total revenue was EUR 45.2 billion, up 26% and plus 12% like-for-like. 9 months international revenue, which accounts for more than half of the total, was up 48% and up 17% like-for-like. Changes in scope coming mostly from the integration of Cobra IS at the very end of '21 boosted revenue by 27%.\nExchange rate movements had a positive impact of almost plus 4% as several currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar rose against the euro over the period. 9 months revenue in France was up 8%. Number two, the order intake. The order intake at VINCI Energies, Cobra IS and VINCI Construction totaled EUR 41.1 billion in the 9 months '22, up 26% year-on-year and up 6%, excluding Cobra IS. Order intake increased in every business line relative to 2021, due in particular to firm levels of flow business through the whole period.\nThe order book remained at a historically high level of EUR 57.4 billion at the end of September. It's up 26% year-on-year and plus 2% excluding Cobra IS, and it represents 15 months of average activity. This very robust order book gives VINCI good visibility and serenity allowing the group to continue being selective and cherry picking new contracts.\nPlease note that international business represents 68% of the order book. Number three, in terms of balance sheet, the net financial debt of VINCI at the end of September amounted to EUR 20.1 billion, representing a limited increase of EUR 0.8 billion versus the end of 2021. This amount of debt is sustainable given our cash flow generation profile.\nIt includes the acquisition made during the period, the payment of the final dividend in 2021 and share buyback. VINCI liquidity remains substantial at almost EUR 18 billion at the end of September, of which a managed net cash of EUR 7.4 billion and EUR 10.5 billion of unused [LCS]. As a result, we've such a sound financial position. VINCI is well prepared to continue dealing with the unexpected and continue its development notably with the upcoming acquisition of Kontron by VINCI Energies and the acquisition of the stake of OMA in Mexico by VINCI Airport.\nLet's now have a closer look at the main divisions. VINCI Autoroutes, 9 months revenue of EUR 4.6 billion plus 11% versus 2021 and plus 7% versus 2019. In Q3, traffic levels remain buoyant despite higher fuel prices. Resilience, they rose by 2.5% versus Q3 '19, of which plus 2.4% for cars and plus 3.7% for trucks.\nIn the first 9 months, traffic levels rose by 2.3% versus 9 months '19, of which plus 1.8% for cars and plus 5.5% for trucks. VINCI Airports, 9 months revenue of EUR 2 billion 2.6x the revenue of the 9 months '21 and down only 13% (inaudible) at constant perimeter versus 9 months of '19.\nYou have already seen the traffic figures and noticed that the recovery in passenger numbers continued to accelerate in Q3 at almost all of our airports. Momentum was strong in Europe, South America and the Caribbean. Passenger numbers returned to levels equal to or higher than 2019 at several airports, particularly in Portugal, Serbia and the Americas. In Asia, meanwhile, passenger growth remained weaker because of the travel restrictions still in place at the end of September in several countries in the region, but they could increase over the coming months with travel restriction eased recently in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nOverall, the passenger numbers in 9 months '22 reached 69% of the 2019 level, of which 54% in Q1, 73% in Q2, then 78% in Q3. Excluding Kansai and Cambodian airports, these passenger numbers reached 81% of the 2019 level, of which 89% in Q3. Moreover, bear in mind that VINCI Airports remained active in M&A in Q3, announcing notably the acquisition of 29.9% stake in OMA, which holds concession for 13 airports in Mexico that together handled 23 million packs in 2019 including the airport of Monterrey, the key manufacturing hub of the country.\nThe deal will make VINCI Airports the leading shareholder of OMA and enable it to apply its long-term partnership model with the aim of supporting Mexico's economic growth as well as its tourism industry. The concession agreement is due to end up in 2048. We will not comment on this acquisition today ahead of the closing, which is expected in December 2022.\nVINCI Energies, 9-month revenue of EUR 11.9 billion, up 10% and plus 7% like-for-like versus 2021. To wrap up, after a very brilliant first half, VINCI Energies revenue growth accelerated in Q3, up 9% like-for-like versus Q3 '21, both in France and abroad, that's remarkable. International revenue in the first 9 months, 55% of the total was up 11%, plus 6% like-for-like, of which plus 8% like-for-like in Q3.\nIn France, 9 months revenue was up 7% like-for-like, of which 11% in Q3. Order intake of VINCI Energies remained robust, up 8%. In the rolling 12 months to end September, order intake of VINCI Energy amounted to a record high level of EUR 17.1 billion. Order book stands at EUR 12.6 billion, plus 11% year-on-year and represents 9 months of VINCI Energies average activity.\nAll in all, this excellent performance was driven by bond market, energy transition and digital transformation but also by VINCI Energies diversity in terms of geographical exposure and expertise. Finally, please note that VINCI Energies remain as well active on the M&A front, having completed 22 bolt-on acquisitions in the first 9 months of the year.\nThey are all in Europe, except 1 in Canada, and these acquisitions represent a cumulative annual revenue of around EUR 275 million. In addition, VINCI Energies has announced recently, the signature of an agreement to acquire the majority of the IT services business of German Group Kontron. This transaction, once closed, will enable VINCI Energies to grow its ICT business and establish a foothold for its (inaudible) in around 10 countries in Central and Eastern Europe.\nThey announced as well the acquisition of TLT-Building and TLT-Connection in Finland strengthening the Scandinavian presence of the company in energy and telecommunication infrastructure. Cobra IS, 9 months revenue of EUR 4.1 billion, of which 46% in Spain and 35% in Latin America. It was driven by good momentum in flow business, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Mexico and Peru, and by EPC projects such as power transmission lines in Brazil.\nOrder intake year-to-date amounted to EUR 6.5 billion. This reflects solid order intake in flow business, along with some large EPC contract wins in Q3. For the record, 2 new contracts for high-voltage lines in Brazil, a contract to build and install 2 offshore converter platforms for wind farms in the North Sea.\nThe order book of Cobra IS, is EUR 11.2 billion, a high level that represent around 24 months of activity. VINCI Construction, 9 months revenue of EUR 21.5 million, up 12% and plus 9% like-for-like. To wrap up, VINCI Construction generated a high level of revenue in Q3.\nIndeed, the growth in Q3 was plus 13%, an acceleration versus H1, acceleration driven particularly by VINCI's Construction international exposure. International revenue in the first 9 months, 54% of the total was up 19% and plus 13% like-for-like. In addition to a positive currency effect, revenue was driven by the ramp-up of large contracts obtained recently in the U.K., Denmark, North America, Australia and New Zealand. Not as well that the revenue abroad in the specialty networks also rose very sharply.\nIn France, 9 months revenue was up 4%. Business levers remain very well oriented in civil engineering and in wood works, also the growth was lower in Q3 than in H1. In building, Activity was driven by several large nonresidential projects in the Greater Paris area. Order intake of VINCI construction, up 5% in 9 months '22, remained robust due to good performance in flow business in France. VINCI's construction order book stands at EUR 33.6 billion, almost stable year-on-year and represents 14 months of average activity, enabling it to maintain a selective approach to taking on new business. VINCI Immobilier, 9 months revenue amounted to EUR 1.1 billion, up 2% year-on-year, of which plus 11% in Q3.\nProduction remains same overall, a rather good performance in the current economic environment. The number of housing units reserved in France at the end of September was down 9% versus 9 months '21, but up 2% in Q3 '22 versus Q3 '21. In conclusion, based on these very solid performance in the first 9 months of '22, VINCI confirms that it expects full year net income to be ahead of the 2019 figure.\nIts guidance for its various business lines in 2022 are in a nutshell, VINCI Autoroutes forecast full year traffic levels higher than those of 2019. VINCI Airports anticipates barring a (inaudible) of the pandemic, passenger numbers for 2022 to be around 70% of the 2019 level, allowing VINCI Airports to generate positive net income and free cash flow.\nVINCI Energies with bond market should be able to continue growing the business while solidifying its operating margin. Cobra IS anticipates revenue of around EUR 5.5 billion and operating margin in line with the industry's best-in-class. VINCI Construction due to its very large order book, expects to remain busy and improve its operating margin while continuing to be selective.\nDespite geopolitical, economic and pandemic-related uncertainty, VINCI remains confident that it will be able to maintain consistent growth over the long term. The group is well equipped to achieve this due to the diversity of its business activities and geographical locations. In addition, as a provider of services to the energy, construction and mobility, it's positioned to take full advantage of new opportunities arising from the green group. We would like to thank you for your attention, and we are now ready to take your questions.",

Welcome to the First Half Financial results '22 for VINCI. (Operator Instructions). Over now to your host, Mr. Xavier Huillard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to begin today's conference call. Over to you, sir.\n\nXavier M. P. Huillard\n\nChairman & CEO, VINCI SA\n\nThank you. Good morning to you all. Happy to be with you once again. You're all physically in good shape. Thanks for attending the presentation of our H1 activities. As per usual, I'm joined by Christian Labeyrie in the room. You have all the representatives of the Executive Committee, all the business bosses in particular, but also our Head of HR, Head of the Environment, who'll also be able to answer your questions later.\nAs per usual, a few photographs. First slide is a photograph that invites to travel. For those of you who are off later on, Peloponnese in Greece, and it illustrates that the extension and linking up of motorway concessions is perfectly possible. 75 km extension of Corinth-Patras to Pyrgos built with our Greek partners, goes from Athens as far as Patras, where it joins up with the Rion-Antirion bridge that we've shown you many times and will be extended to the West of the Peloponnese 75 km through to the town of Pyrgos. I'm sure you've seen all the details of this transaction in the press release of March 21 last year.\nAnother affiliation, this time in France, we reached an agreement with the government to build the Western bypass of Montpellier.\nNext slide, recent signing of the concessions contract of the 7 airports of Cape Verde for 40 years. The idea is to assist in the growth of the tourist potential of the country, representing a significant part of the island's economy. And we'll be rolling out across our airports our green initiatives. And given the local conditions of wind and sun units to produce solar and wind power.\nNext picture that illustrates the full ownership, 100% acquisition of TollPlus that develops, implements, operates tech solutions for motorway mobility and free flow dynamic tolls and all the back office underpinning all these electronic and dynamic toll systems. TollPlus employ 350 people. It's expanded in the U.S. and Europe, in particular, Ireland and a bit in India. Illustration of the markup of the future airport of (inaudible), 1,400 beds, 54 operating theaters. And VINCI Energies has won very -- many important works, packages that illustrates the know-how and expertise of VINCI Energies. This is a transaction that was made possible and its funding after the (inaudible) health plan. We considered one of the first effects of the broad stimulus plans put in place over the past few years in our country.\nNext, a picture of the subsea fixed link, which in 2029 will connect Denmark and Germany. You'll recall that we won and then started off the civil engineering works. This time, it's Cobra that won the contract for the electro-mechanical installations, incident management, traffic management for EUR 535 million. And Cobra already has underway the corresponding works on several road -- or rail infrastructures in Sweden and Norway.\nThis is really just an artist view that illustrates the fact that VINCI Construction is expanding its operations into Oceania. So you have here an extra-dosed bridge, which is part of the Penlink project, North of Auckland in New Zealand. It's a 7 km structure, both road and soft mobility, with major green environmental ambitions.\nAnd to close the slide show, this is a fine product for VINCI Real Estate. It's to renovate a former hanger for airships located in Meudon, outskirts of Paris, to turn it into cultural event center promoted and funded by ArtNova, founded by Frédéric Jousset, 1 of the 2 Cofounders of Webhelp. He's left Webhelp's his stake and is investing heavily in art and culture.\nSo all this was just to illustrate with a few photographs the fact that the world is full to the brim of projects to connect people and territories, mobility infrastructure, but also to improve the lives, the environmental footprint of human activity, health and culture. We have multiple occasions worldwide both to continue to be a force for good whilst being particularly mindful of the state of the planet.\nReturning to our half and the financial performance. Put briefly, we have recorded a strong performance during this first half. And VINCI Airport, that is recovering spectacularly traffic levels x3 versus H1 '21. On French Autoroutes, traffic levels now higher than in 2019. Growth in business and operating margins at VINCI Energies and VINCI Construction and a performance delivered by Cobra in line with our expectations.\nSo the revenue for H1 has led 26% versus H1 '21. And when we exclude the contribution of Cobra, which is -- it's actually a 14% increase over last year. The operating income is over EUR 1.3 billion 1 year and way above that of H1 2019. Order book is being renewed very satisfactorily, and the order book is a good quality, which means we can be both prudent and selective in this environment where, of course, we are potentially impacted by the rise in raw materials. So we have to pick not just the right contracts that are in line with our requirements and the contractual clauses with price indexation.\nAll our geographies are up, in particular, as you can see, particularly Europe outside France and Central and Southern America. And this is due essentially to the arrival of Cobra that's positioned on these geographies. For the first time in our history, I believe our revenue outside France has topped the 50% market, and that's fully consistent with the strategic roadmap that we set out 7 or 8 years ago, we're at 53% of our business outside France.\nIf we delve deeper into the business details. VINCI Autoroutes light passenger traffic is above its 2019 level. Our foreign customers are back. We remain attentive and prudent because all that's pretty sensitive. I'm still with light vehicles here with the price of fuel at the pump. What's more remarkable is truck traffic is trending well, thanks in particular to the growth in e-commerce. And as I mentioned, we've signed the rider to deliver the Western bypass to the city of Montpellier, which will decongest the local roads by 2030 that are currently heavily congested.\nI repeat, every time we meet the road is the vital network of any economy, in particular, that of the French economy, it's therefore urgent to decarbonize road transport by developing vehicles that are decarbonized, light vehicles and, down the road, trucks. But by rolling out all the initiatives that are proposed by the low-carbon motorway concept launched a few years back by VINCI Autoroutes, by way of an illustration, we're going to make the motorway a place to -- for green energy production with a potential of 1 gigawatt peak on all the motorway air and service areas available on our motorway networks.\nWhat's interesting is this 1 gigawatt, even if we know it's slightly more complicated, is the power that will be needed to top up the batteries of our light vehicles by 2035. 1 gigawatt, that will be the addition of a great number of small solar power units, but this can help us to auto-produce the power that our customers will need once e-mobility has been fully rolled out in our country by 2035.\nIt's also the rollout of electric charging stations that are high powered, and this will be done in 2023. In 2023, all our areas will be equipped with high-power recharge stations. In last June, we launched an app that I may have mentioned 6 months ago, it's Ulys Electric, allows all customers who opt for Ulys to geo-locate almost all the public recharge stations available across the country. Once they're in front of a station, they can unlock it and pay it without bothering about who's the manager of the charging station. That's a problem. You have to move around with several different cars. You're never sure you're going to be able to unlock the charging station, which puts a break on the rollout of e-mobility. That's going to be boosted through this Ulys app, giving a seamless transaction with almost all the public recharge stations in particular on our motorways.\nFinal point, we responded to a call for tenders put out by the public investment bank, BPI in France, to trial, ERSs, electric road systems, through which we plan to power vehicles and trucks while they're on the road. There are several possible technologies. We've trialed some with VINCI Energy in Germany and Scandinavia. France is getting there. BPIs launched a call for projects and will be a trial ground on our motorways. And the 2 technologies which I believe have the wind in sales through induction and current capture in sort of a rail that is buried in the asphalt.\nVINCI Airport. The recovery is gathering pace. June traffic only down 25% versus 2019 pre-COVID. Many airports are very close to 2019 levels. It's the case in Portugal, other airports are already above 2019 traffic levels. That's the case of a number of airports in the Americas. Traffic at Gatwick, that took off, without any play on words, has grown strongly. It's only down 23% in June versus 2019. Airports in Cambodia and Japan are picking up slowly, far more slowly. And the simple reason for that is due to the reduction in the number of travelers and visitors from China.\nAnd on the Autoroutes, motorways managed outside France, there the recovery is similar to what we're seeing in France. Traffic recovery is almost back to 2019 levels with a very slight question mark depending on the way in which fuel prices at the pump will trend in the countries where we have assets, all leading to the good financial performance of VINCI Airport that you see shown on the slide. The revenue and consolidated EBITDA of H1 exceeds that of H1 2019.\nAs previously mentioned, still on VINCI Airports, we won the concession for the 7 Cape Verde airports for 40 years, which, on the one hand, confirms our confidence in that mode of transport and also confirms our specific skills and expertise for everything that revolves around mobility-linked tourism. Portugal, a lot of tourism; Dominican Republic, a lot of tourism; ditto for Brazil; and likewise, Cape Verde.\nLastly, at VINCI Airport, we continue -- and VINCI Concessions in general, we continue to systematically roll out our green strategy across all our assets. By way of illustration, less than 28% decrease of our CO2 emissions since '19, 98%. We're 50% ahead of the plan by 2030. Léon will be net 0 by '26. Toulon will be net 0 by 2023.\nIn this industry, back to Airports specifically, there's an accreditation known as ACO with successive levels depending on your environmental performance. We have the 9 Portuguese airports and 3 Japanese airports that are accredited at the highest level, actually, one notch below the highest level, which is ACA 4. An entry into service as in the Autoroutes of solar plants and the launch of new projects on the airports and our Greek and German motorways, you've seen the press release. We've strengthened our stake in Lusoponte managing the 2 bridges, a stride that take us in Lisbon. We took the outright majority in the bridge the confederation in Canada that links the Canadian mainland with Prince Edward Island. And we have 100% control of TollPlus, as I said, works.\nSlide 17. Contracting, very good order intake both at VINCI Energy, Cobra and VINCI Construction. In particular, on the flow business, small day-to-day batches that are very important to boost our resilience. You see that the 3 columns on the right of this slide that are 3 geographic segments, France, Europe excluding France and international excluding Europe. The 3 geographies are up, but the segments made up of Europe excluding France and international excluding Europe are posting particularly strong growth. And that's the support of the arrival of Cobra that is focused on the Iberian Peninsula and Central and Latin America.\nVINCI Energies is in great shape, well established on the 3 very dynamic underlying trends that are energy efficiency, the energy transition and its corollary, which is the rollout of electrical power in the energy mix and the digital revolution and the huge needs in terms of data storage and data operations and security. The pace has accelerated VINCI Energy in the second quarter, up 8% versus 21%, 10% outside France. And outside France now accounts for 55% of the total.\nCherry on the cake, VINCI Energies is taking advantage of this to improve its operating margin, coming in at 6.5% as against 6% in H1 '21. Still a continuous slow flow of small bolt-ons, some dozen bolt-ons since the start of the year with the same rationale, the same logic to supplement our geographic networks or areas of expertise. Order intake, good news, up further by 9%, giving us very good visibility. What we keep repeating and proving through this rather disrupted period is the strategic positioning of VINCI Energy. The very highly decentralized model of VINCI Energy giving a lot of agility and nimbleness. This quest for tech value-added makes VINCI Energy a tremendous machine that has a great role to play in combating climate change.\nThe integration of Cobra, as I said, is going according to expectation. Good momentum in flow business, in particular, in Spain, that's not surprising, also in Peru, Mexico or in Colombia. But also with some good EPC projects, engineering, procurement, construction, as you know, such as offshore AC-DC conversion platforms for wind farms that are far out at sea. If you require some technical explanations on this, I was -- knew nothing about this technology about 6 months about it. But now you can -- I can give you all the answers. I'm really fascinated by this technology. This illustration shown here on this slide that transforms AC to DC power. And it can only happen, DC. Otherwise, you'd have a lot of loss of power through the dual effect. Whatever the diameter of the cable you put on the sea to connect it to land. This is a good example of what the Cobra people can do through major EPC projects.\nAnd other illustrations. The high-voltage power lines in Brazil, Cobra for 20 years now has delivered PPP, 20,000 km of high-voltage lines in Brazil. They are fully familiar with this business segment and this geography.\nAnd of course, at Cobra, we continue to grow our renewable energy fields, and we've begun the CapEx on the first transaction, a project, photovoltaic, 1,500 megawatts peak power in Brazil. Others in the pipe should enter the construction phase in the coming months. Cobra's economic performance delivered, as you can see, both in terms of development business operating margin, shown on this slide, EBIT margin and order intake.\nGood half at VINCI Construction in spite of disruption brought about by the significant high number of raw materials, bitumen, steel, cement, energy. Nevertheless, revenues up 11% versus H1 '21 driven by business outside France, up 18%. But still nevertheless, growth in France 4%. This activity is very healthy, made up of many local projects of building, civil engineering. That's the flow business. But it's also particularly strong on big building projects in the Paris region and large mobility infrastructures, the Greater Paris Express the high-speed line HS2, with Balfour Beatty in the U.K. and several motorways or rail infrastructure in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, not to mention the preparatory work of the subsea fixed link previously mentioned between Denmark and Germany.\nVINCI Construction delivers 50% of its business outside France in accordance with our strategic roadmap. Order intake, stable, these metrics. Good news because it attests and demonstrates great selectivity, great many projects that are offered by our clients globally. And we have the choice. We can go all out on projects that fit our skills and know-hows, where we can express ourselves to the full. We can include contractual clauses that suit us down to the ground, price revision clauses. So as not to be subsequently impacted by further significant price hikes of the number of supplies or materials. I often speak of major projects, but what you need to know is VINCI Construction has a day-to-day activity made up of small- and medium-sized work packages.\nH1, actually, it's 2/3 of our order intake that our works packages below EUR 5 million. So it's a lot of small works packages, and that's very important in order to ensure our resilience. The operating margin, VINCI Construction is up versus H1 '21. Let me remind you that at this stage doesn't reflect the full year because of the seasonal nature of a lot of VCs work, in particular, road works.\nAnd to close, VINCI Real Estate is going through a somewhat more challenging phase. It's not reflected in the business. It's slightly up if we include our shares in co-developments, but it's reflected in the service markets in large cities such as Paris. That's kind of in wait-and-see mode on the back of the pandemic number of clients are waiting to see what's going to pan out in terms of demand for commercial real estate offices. And the residential metric, most relevant is reservations that's down 15% over the half versus H1 '21, which was positively impacted by the post-COVID recovery.\nWhat's Paris (inaudible) is strong housing needs in France, strong demand for sociological reasons, in particular, difficult to produce housing. Why? Well, for a number of reasons previously mentioned: price of land has reached significantly high levels; the reluctance of certain elected representatives to build; the time it takes to get a planning positions and to overcome the appeals on a lot of this planning permission.\nAnd then there are 2 further reasons: of course, rising interest rates, which reduces the ability by private owners to acquire their homes or at least in terms of the surface area, all this squeezed by rising borrowing costs. And this, of course, impacts property developers and other players. The constructors are asking more to build a square meter of office space than they wanted a year ago. This situation mustn't last for too long. I hope the government has realized the importance of this situation. We were delighted to note that our Housing Minister has been appointed in the (inaudible) government. It wasn't the case in the previous government, that's rather strange.\nOver to Christian Labeyrie.\n\nChristian Labeyrie\n\nCFO & Executive VP, VINCI SA\n\nThank you, Xavier. So I'll give you some comments as usual on the main figures, perhaps with a bit of repetition. I do apologize if I repeat some of the things that Xavier has said.\nFirst slide is the analysis of the consolidated revenue, which is up 26% on the first half, 13% reflecting the scope change mainly due to the integration of Cobra, which has been consolidated since the 31st of December 2021. As you can see, organic growth was up strongly at 12%. And the currency impact is strong this year due to the appreciation of most currencies, in particular, the dollar versus the euro.\nThe next slide is another way of analyzing the revenues by geography. Organic growth, as you can see, is stronger outside of France than in France, but it's still strong. In France, at approximately 8%, and the scope effects mainly reflect international activities and namely the integration of Cobra. And as Xavier said, the share of revenue internationally is now above that of our French revenue, 53% versus 45%. Regarding analysis of results, where you've heard at length about that, there are arrows going upwards for all the businesses. And the performance has improved also in relative value versus revenue, even though margins vary considerably depending on the business.\nNext slide is the analysis of the income statement. Well, we're not going to go into detail on everything. I'd like to leave some room for questions. But on the results, the equity affiliates, the improvement is due to Japan since we're consolidating our interest in Kansai Airport of 40% under the equity method. We still haven't reached breakeven because, in terms of air traffic, Japan is somewhat lagging behind other areas, but the losses are less in 2022 than in 2021 and 2020. Further, what we can say is that there are some nonrecurring items to the tune of EUR 54 million, which are mainly accounting impacts due to the inclusion in our financial statements of companies which were affiliates, which now have been consolidated, equity accounted. This concerns the confederation bridge in Canada and TollPlus for toll management.\nThe interesting point here is the decline in net financial expense, which has been more than halved. What you need to remember, and I think I heard spoken about this when we released results in February, in terms of the cost of our debt load, we're benefiting fully from the effect of the refinancing conducted last year at a lower cost compared to the redemptions which have occurred for existing debt. This impacts ASF and VINCI and furthermore cash investments which were being done at negative interest rates now around 0. And we hope that this will go into the black soon. That's the positive impact of interest rates going up. There's an accounting impact on provisions for major repair work to VINCI Motorway. So we -- there's a positive impact here, although there is a less positive impact on operating income. So it's a zero-sum game, basically.\nBut -- and a few other items here also regarding financial results. Now tax is stable, but this is due, first of all, to an increase in the taxable income in 2022. So it's quite logical. We have higher tax, but we have a lower tax -- corporate tax rate in France, where it should last as we got to reach the target rate of 25%. And before we were at even 34% previously, so we benefited from the lower corporate tax rate. And last year, in the EUR 800 million, there was EUR 400 million of an accounting charge, which was a revaluation of our deferred tax rate because Mr. Johnson at the time had gone back, reneged on his promise to cut corporate tax rates.\nSo all that leads us to a positive result of EUR 1.9 billion, which, quite frankly, is beyond all expectations and well above that of last year. But we should have had a 2019 column to show that we've improved even on the pre-COVID situation. So high quality, very good results.\nNext slide, it's the analysis of the change in net financial debt. The debt load has gone up, but that comes as no surprise. This usually happens every year in the first half given that 2020 and 2019 were atypical. So we were very glad to retrieve long-standing customer receivables. We reduced significantly our investment. That's no longer the case, of course, EBITDA is up strongly on previous years including 2019. Working capital has increased strongly. I recall that prior to 2020, we had working capital that increased in the first half to EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1 billion, so we're back to normal situation in 2020 versus 2020, 2021, maybe a bit better. This is due to the improvement in customer receivables in accessible of the growth in revenue, which is the reverse phenomenon from previous years' clients who are paying us less or more slowly than prior to -- during the COVID period. Perhaps this is due to the rise in interest rates.\nNow looking at supplies in our present situation, we didn't do that. We tend to pay our suppliers more quickly, in fact, to place orders in order to secure our energy supply. And this applies to VINCI Construction and VINCI Energy. So we've booked in advance the supplies, equipment, services in order to establish our cost on the secure footing.\nThe other aspects here, which are down payments on major projects, in 2020, 2021, we had very significant down payments on major projects. As Xavier explained, our order book renewal mainly concerns medium to small deals, which are usually paid at the end of the execution. So all this combines to account for the EUR 2.5 billion figure, which we hope will reverse by the end of the year because, as you know, the best part of our cash flow is in the second half.\nInterest expense is more or less in line. Over a 10-year period, you can see that free cash flow for the first half is slightly negative, depending on the years, but it's only a small part of the annual situation, which, unfortunately, that's just how it is in the last few months or weeks of the year.\nThe next slide is the balance sheet. With over EUR 50 billion of capital employed in the Concessions, mainly profits in Construction, equity is high. It's even up. Lease debt is stable, and cash is lower because given the financial market situation since the war in Ukraine, the markets were not propitious for IFR issues. And therefore, all our first half spending in addition to free cash flow, which is not really significant, it's the dividend balance for 2021 plus share buybacks. We had share buybacks of EUR 900 million plus acquisitions in the various business units. So all this has weighed on the cash from EUR 9 billion on consolidated to EUR 6 billion cash at the end of June, which should be restored in the next few months especially if we are able to benefit from the window of opportunity and we're able to launch bond issues exploiting favorable market conditions. So we'll remain opportunistic in that regard. And we've accumulated a lot of cash. We've reduced it, but it's still very comfortable, that over EUR 6 billion.\nThe next slide is a reminder of our financial policy. Our credit ratings are unchanged. They're excellent. And in small characters at the bottom in the footnote, given what I've just said about our opportunistic refinancing policy, we're cautious people. We went to our relationship banks, 10 banks to ask for a one-off facility in order not to touch our EUR 8 billion structural backup. So we asked for one-off, so thank you very much, EUR 2.5 billion, with maturity extendable to 2 years, which enabled us to wait for better times in order to refinance our debt redemptions. We've redeemed since the beginning of the year EUR 2.4 billion in existing debt. We haven't refinanced that. And looking ahead to 2023, it's over EUR 3 billion. So this also accounts for the fact that cash has declined because we haven't refinanced it. And we're not rushing given current uncertainty, and we think that things will become clear in the next few months.\nSo I think that's the last slide. No, there's another one after that. Recalling that in the present situation, we've continued to optimize the cost of our net debt, which is just above 2%. Of course, if we had to borrow now, it will be more than 2% borrowing cost, of course, especially if we borrow in currencies other than the euro, for example, dollars and sterling.\nThank you very much. Now a few words on how we see the full year for 2022. Slide #33, you can see the chart -- the quarterly chart since 2020. Our view is that for the year as a whole for 2022, global traffic will be in excess of the levels of 2019, in particular on HVs, heavy vehicles, which should continue to outperform for the reasons we've already given. And given our conclusion for the first half, light vehicles should also increase. But we're more prudent there because, of course, there's always uncertainty due to the increase in fuel cost. But if the provisions made by the state ensure a fuel price of less than EUR 1.50 per liter, that should enable us to maintain stable light vehicle traffic versus 2019.\nSo the conclusion is we'll have higher traffic for the full year than for 2019. The main change is VINCI Airports. You have lots of colors in the chart which shows how our business has evolved over the different platforms some consolidated, some are not. What we're aiming for the full year is overall traffic close to 70% of the traffic that we saw in 2019, unless we have a new pandemic episode. And 6 months ago, when we last met, our guidance was 60%. So this is taking into account the step-up in traffic, which was -- has been referred to several times since the beginning of the presentation. What is important is that if we're at 70% of 2019 traffic for VINCI Airports, this will lead to a faster return to net income and free cash flow both positive for 2022.\nNow looking at the works, construction, looking at the order book, the order book is at a very good level, in fact, at a historic level in volume terms. And it's also of high -- the quality of the order book is very good.\nAgain, there are issues with availability of some supplies and materials, spectacular price increases in some materials and supplies. That means that we have to really fight in order for new contracts to have proper price in taxation. And for contracts which are underway, and some of which may not have proper coverage for price increases, then we have to fight by looking for additions from the clients. And we have to fight for this by hedging when we can, price increase for materials or moving ahead in relation to price increases or optimizing -- by optimizing the projects by extracting cost savings that can enable us to offset at least in part the increases in material prices. So our teams are very strongly mobilized, and this enables us to confirm the guidance that we gave 6 months ago.\nVINCI Energy will confirm its operating margin. Cobra should post EUR 5.5 billion in business with operating margins among the best in the profession. And VINCI Construction should post further growth in revenue, and it should also improve its operating margin. Overall, the strong performance of the first half of 2022 vindicates our capacity to exceed in 2022 the net income posted in 2019.\nNow at this stage, I would conclude simply by saying that VINCI is a wonderful machine, very well diversified in its businesses. And in terms of cycles, short term, midterm -- medium term, long term in terms of geographies. It's well positioned on major trends regarding the energy transition, the environmental transition. It is a machine which is extremely flexible in terms of its organization, which ensures its ability to go through periods of turbulence, and it's also extremely combative. And we are well equipped to pursue in the years ahead a virtuous growth trajectory. And Pierre is making -- is looking at me.\nI'd just like to conclude with Slide 37, which illustrates the fact that the Board, which met yesterday, has decided on an interim dividend for 2022 of EUR 1 per share. And you will recall that the last pre-COVID interim payment was in 2019. And if I recollect correctly, it was EUR 0.70 per action -- per share. We have finished our presentation, and we are ready to take your questions.",

    "content": "Q1 2022 Vinci SA Corporate Sales Call\n\nQ1 2022 Vinci SA Corporate Sales Call\n\nDGPARISAPR 21, 12:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nVINCI's Q1 '22 Revenue Conference Call. I will now hand over to Mr. Gregoire Thibault, Head of Investor Relations of VINCI. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nGregoire Thibault\n\nGroup Director of IR & Financial Communications, VINCI SA\n\nThank you, Laurent. Good evening, and thanks, everybody, for attending this conf call. I'm today with my colleagues of the Investor Relations team, Boris Vale Anil Lunera Media Head of Corporate Controlling and Accounting; and Christophe Ferrer, Head of Group Cash Management and financing. As usual, I will try to be brief to have more time for the Q&A. So what are the key takeaways of this publication? Firstly, a good start to the year of all our businesses. In a nutshell, for VINCI Autoroute, the traffic was much higher than last year and higher than in Q1 '19. For VINCI Airports, passenger numbers continued to recover progressively, benefiting from the reopening trend in many countries, especially in the Americas and in Europe, notably in our 2 main assets, Portugal and London Gatwick.\nFor VINCI Construction, the momentum was good. For VINCI Energy, business levels and order intake were up billions. Finally, have in mind that Cobra IS is consolidated since the 1st of January 2022. I will give you more granularity by division later in my presentation. All in all, total revenue was EUR 12.8 billion, up 26% year-on-year and up 12% like-for-like. International, which now accounts for more than half of the total, was up 51% and up 19% like-for-like.\nChanges in scope were boosted mostly by the integration of Cobra. Exchange rate movements had a positive impact of 3% as several currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and the sterling rose against the euro. France, accounting for 49% of the total revenue, was up 7%.\nRegarding the order intake, order intake at VINCI Energy and VINCI Construction in Q1 '22 were EUR 11.4 billion, almost unchanged year-on-year, despite the high base for comparison. Keep in mind that last year at the same time, VINCI Construction won large project and notably, the same (inaudible) between Denmark and Germany for around EUR 1 billion.\nOrder intake at Cobra totaled EUR 1.1 billion this quarter. The order book amounted to EUR 55 billion at the end of March. This represents a year-on-year increase of 20% and 2% excluding, Cobra, and it represents 14 months of average activity. This all-time high order book gives us good visibility and a lot of synergy allowing us to continue being selective in terms of business at a time when markets are affected by the war in Ukraine, which results in cost inflation and supply shortage.\nAmong this order book, note that the international part is 68%. In terms of financial position, the net financial debt of VINCI at the end of March amounted to EUR 20.7 billion. The limited increase of EUR 1.4 billion since the year-end 2021 reflect the seasonal increase in the working capital requirement, reflect as well our share buyback program for around EUR 600 million and the acquisition carried out during this quarter.\nVINCI's liquidity remains substantial at EUR 15.5 billion at the end of March, of which we managed net cash of EUR 7 billion, a large part of it being centrally managed. As a result, we saw a financial position. VINCI is well prepared to continue dealing with unexpected and continue its development. Although have in mind that S&P confirmed in March its confidence in the group's credit quality by affirming its A- rating with stable outlook.\nLet's now have a closer look at the main divisions. VINCI Autoroutes Q1 revenue of EUR 1.3 billion, up 15% year-on-year and up 9% versus Q1 '19. In the Q1 '22, the traffic continued to rise up 15% year-on-year. Compared with Q1 '19, light vehicle traffic was up 1.5% in and heavy vehicle traffic was up 6.7%, thanks to firm economic activity in France and growth in e-commerce. The slight decline in light vehicle traffic in March was mainly due to the different timing of school winter holidays between 2019 when these holidays were spread over February and March and 2022, when holidays were mainly concentrated in February.\nVINCI Airports revenue of EUR 405 million, 2.6x the revenue of Q1 '21. You have already seen the encouraging traffic figures published last week. VINCI Airport passengers numbers in the Q1 '22 were 3x the numbers seen in Q1 '21 and were [46] below the level of Q1 '19. The gradual return to pre-pandemic level is on track. The picture gets brighter even trends vary between geographic areas.\nIn the Americas, in the U.S., Dominican Republic, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, we see a good momentum. The good trend continues with passenger numbers close to or higher than 2019 levels. I'd like to remind you that the 7 airports in Brazil's North region that have recently joined our network started their operations in January and February this year. In addition, speaking about Americas, I see this opportunity to tell you that the new international terminal of the Santiago Airport has been inaugurated a few weeks ago. That's a key entrance for Chile and it will double the airport capacity to 38 million passengers per year.\nLet's go back in Europe. The easing of COVID restriction led to remarkable improvements in Portugal, in France and in Serbia, notably. In the U.K., the loosening of restriction on international travel in early February led to a marked rebound in passenger numbers at London Gatwick Airport. As a consequence, Gatwick South Terminal reopened on 27th of March, after being closed for almost 2 years because of the pandemic. That's a very positive signal. However, airports in Asia continued to suffer from border closures and ongoing restriction, particularly in China. We saw a slightly better trend in domestic traffic in Japan.\nLet's move to VINCI Energy now. As a wrap up, VINCI Energy, this division started 2022 on a positive note, both in France and abroad. So the base for comparison was high and despite procurement issues which has already been experienced in late 2021, business levels were supported by brilliant market, driven by the energy transition and the increasing deployment of digital technology and broadly speaking, a good momentum in flow business for VINCI Energy.\nMore in detail, Q1 revenue was EUR 3.6 billion, up 7% and up 5% like-for-like versus Q1 '21. Outside France, 53% of the total, revenue was up 9% and 5% like-for-like. In France, revenue was up 4%. Order intake for VINCI Energy was also strong in the first 3 months of the year, up 10% year-on-year. This growth was homogeneous between France at plus 10% and international plus 10%. It's worth highlighting that over the rolling 12 months at the end of March, order intake of VINCI Energy amounted to a record high of EUR 16.5 billion.\nOrder book is EUR 12.2 billion at the end of March, up 13% year-on-year and representing 10 months of VINCI Energy's average business activity. Finally, please note that VINCI Energy remained active on the M&A front having completed 7 bolt-on acquisition in Q1 '22 essentially in Europe, representing a cumulative annual revenue of around EUR 70 million.\nCobra IS revenue of EUR 1.2 billion, with 46% coming from Spain and 36% coming from Latin America. It was driven by good momentum in flow business, particularly in Spain, Peru and Mexico and by EPC projects relating notably to power transition lines in Brazil. Note that around 10% of revenue this quarter is linked to renewable energy projects. Order book of Cobra at the end of March is EUR 8.4 billion of high level that represents more than 18 months of business activity.\nVINCI Construction. The division achieved a substantial increase in revenue at EUR 6 billion, up 14% and up 11% like-for-like. Outside France, that's 51% of the total revenue, growth was outstanding, plus 26% and plus 20% like-for-like. This growth was boosted by the ramp-up of several large contracts, including the 2 work (inaudible) on the high-speed 2 in the U.K. but as well Motor and rail projects in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some proprietary works on the between Denmark and Germany.\nIn France, where we saw a good momentum in road works, revenue was up 3%. The 9% decline in order intake year-on-year of VINCI Construction resulted from a high base for comparison that I mentioned earlier. In addition, given current market trends and given the very robust order book, VINCI Construction is lengthening a particularly selective approach to taking on new business. In particular, note that we have recently taken the decision to stop signing contracts taking place over the medium term unless they have price adjustment clauses. No more fixed-price contracts over the medium term for VINCI.\nVINCI Construction order book ended the quarter at [EUR 34.3 billion], almost unchanged year-on-year, only down 2%. It represents more than 15 months of average activity. VINCI, revenue of EUR 337 million, up 5% year-on-year. Production remained in both the residential and commercial sector. The number of homes reserved in France was 1,102 units, down 28% versus Q1 '21. In Q1 '21, remember, there was a sharp post-COVID catch-up. In other words, the comps were quite challenging this quarter.\nIn conclusion, despite a more challenging economic and geopolitical environment, we confirm our previous 2022 guidance. VINCI Autoroutes expects full year traffic levels to exceed those of 2019. VINCI Airports anticipates that passenger numbers will continue recovering to around 60% of their 2019 level, enabling it to achieve net income close to breakeven. VINCI Energy, which operates in buoyant market, should be able to continue growing its business while solidifying its operational performance.\nCobra IS, benefiting from fee momentum in its business and the ramp-up of some EPC projects, is expecting revenue of around EUR 5.5 billion and operating margin in line with the industry's best-in-class. VINCI Construction, thanks to its very large order book, is likely to remain busy and improve its operating margin while taking a selective approach to new business. Overall, we confirm that VINCI expects net income in 2022 to be higher than the 2019 figure.\nMore broadly, in beyond 2022, we remain confident that VINCI will be able to maintain a consistent growth. The group has a number of key strengths since its energy services, construction and mobility businesses place it at the heart of the green growth. We would like to thank you for your attention and my colleagues and myself are now ready to take your questions.",

    "content": "Full Year 2021 Vinci SA Earnings Call\n\nFull Year 2021 Vinci SA Earnings Call\n\nDGPARISFEB 4, 4:30 AM\n\nXavier M. P. Huillard\n\nChairman & CEO, VINCI SA\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for taking part in this presentation of our 2021 results. I hope you can all hear me. I also hope that you found on our website the presentation of our results, which you'll be able to read through this morning. We're at the Archipel Building, this is our new HQ in Notter. At my side, there are several of my colleagues from Executive Committee, especially Christian Labeyrie, who's seated next to me; plus the main -- the heads of the main business lines. that will be able to answer questions you have later.\nFirst of all, a few pictures quickly as is our custom. The first one is just to illustrate the fact that we opened last December, the Strasbourg bypass with Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, who used the opportunity, firstly, to congratulate the environmental excellence of the project, but also to give a strong speech about revamping road mobility, emphasizing the fact that roads are essential for the development of France. He even added that roads were no longer to be viewed as the enemy of the environmental transition and shouldn't be seen as something that opposes rail travel. Both these types of mobility go hand in hand was his point.\nOn the next slide, we see that we took charge a few days ago in January for a 30-year period of the Manaus Airport. Will also be gradually taking charge of regional airports located near Manaus, 6 further small airports in Brazil. Manaus is the #3 cargo airport in Brazil, especially most importantly, its infrastructure is completely crucial for the economic and social development of the Amazon region. Our project is to roll out there. Our environmental action plan just as we did in Salvador, which since our arrival in 2018 has become the most sustainable airport in the whole of Brazil.\nNext slide. We're showing you that we finalized the financing of the B247 Federal Road in Germany, PPP 30-year Motorway, investment around EUR 500 million. This is a project, which is a good illustration of the development of the PPP model in Germany. I'm sure you know, we already said this, we're a leader in this business area with 5 PPPs that we've won already.\nNext, we have a picture of the project designed by VINCI Energy, it's a floating photovoltaic farm on an old quarry that was rehabilitative of Vinci Construction. I'd add that the solar panels are placed on water which is a plus. It increases the overall energy yield of the facility because this water naturally cools the 44,000 PV panels that after the building of this will make it possible to provide electricity for around 6,400 households.\nHere, we have an illustration of a major project that we won along with our Italian partner, under the gigantic Lyon Turin railway project. Our portion is 23 kilometers of bitumen tunnels, which is 46 kilometers of tunnels all in all, plus around 70 safety branching tunnels. This should be a 5-year project employing around 1,650 people.\nLastly, VINCI Immobilier real estate is developing part of the athlete's village and 6.4 hectares of industrial brownfield. It's complex because, first of all, it's designed for the Olympic Games in 2024, 6,000 beds for the athletes, 33,000 square meters of services and workspace. And afterwards, it will all be converted just after the Olympics to turn it into a new neighborhood, blended neighborhood, residential plus offices. And during both stages of the process, careful attention will be played to environmental performance as well as social performance. Furthermore, this is a beautiful illustration of the concept of urban recycling. A great illustration of the 0 net artificialization strategy no soil ceiling that we talked about already at the beginning of the year.\nThose points made, I'd like to say VINCI is doing well after 2020, which showed our great ability to adapt great resilience. Now in 2021, we're booking a strong rebound revenue for the full year going beyond 2019, up around 3%. Our order intake, very good; order book, looking very good; a clear turnaround in margins as well.\nNow an important salient point, free cash flow up. It's a record level EUR 5.3 billion. This, of course, is due to an uptick in overall revenues, but it's also thanks to a great deal of work to get cash in from billings. VINCI Airports cash flow went back in the black in the second half of 2021. This is thanks to major for its intense efforts made to cut both OpEx and CapEx.\nSecond item, our Works business, increasing their operating margins. Operating margin levels are record highs, 6.5% at VINCI Energy and a gain of 40 basis points, reaching 3.7% at new Vinci construction versus 2019.\nNext item, motorway traffic has recovered very quickly as soon as restrictions were lifted. And for them since around the second half of 2021. Its level has reached a higher level than the pre-covid level. We also benefited this year, reap the benefits of continued rollout of our strategy for the environment and in-depth strategy. We've got all of our employees on board in all of our geographies, and we'll be talking about this in more detail at our next Annual General Meeting.\nLastly, at the very end of the year, 31 December of the year in December, we've closed on COBRA AS acquisition, which we'll be building a global leader in engineering services relating to energy and also boost our development in concessions for renewable energy.\nAll geographies, this is Page 12 of my slide show all geographies are seeing growth versus 2020. the most active geographies are also growing versus 2019, especially on the left hand side of the slide, you can see North America growing very significantly, reaching now almost EUR 4 billion in revenue. We've made major progress in that part of the world over the past few years.\nNow to delve into greater detail in each business line, starting with VINCI Autoroutes, after the first 4 months of the year, they were a little bit more difficult, particularly April, as you'll remember, where there were still some lockdowns. So after that period, light vehicle traffic quickly recovered, reaching levels above traffic levels for 2019. That was in the second half. completing the year at minus 5.3% compared to traffic observed in 2019 during the same period. To talk about heavy goods vehicles, heavy vehicles, this was much better. It continued to be above 2019 levels throughout the year, ending the year plus 3.1%. Interesting to observe, we feel that there's still a great potential for growth.\nTwo phenomena here: First of all, we observed that foreign traffic, especially at the Spanish border was below the norm for the whole year. So it should recover this year. Furthermore, bus traffic also continued to feel a strong impact of restrictions, and we do believe it should rebound this year. The crisis has yet again confirmed that roadways are the vital network in our country. Nine trips out of 10 are made by road. Our belief is that decarbonizing France and meeting commitments to decarbonize our country broadly, these targets will only be met quickly if we don't quickly decarbonize mobility, generally precisely decarbonize road transport. That's precisely what we're doing with our low-carbon motorways program. This is what Jon Castex, the Prime Minister, underscored when he inaugurated the Strasbourg bypass 13 December.\nVINCI Autoroutes, some of the main project owners in France, and we're very pleased to have reached an agreement and gotten the go ahead from the State Council last Saturday precisely. It was put in the official journal. It's an addendum, making it possible for us to carry out the Western bypass of Montpellier thereby continuing our missions to -- with an eye to town and country planning.\nLet's move on to VINCI Airports, Slide 14. VINCI Airports the first half was depressed. But after the first half, we saw a clear uptick starting from the summer time, ending up with the last quarter that had more than doubled versus the corresponding quarter in 2020. Situation is still quite a mix, varies from geography to geography. In the Americas, they're reaching almost normal levels, going almost, sometimes beyond traffic booked in 2019 in some countries. Europe is starting to normalize. The United Kingdom will begin improving. Travel restrictions very recently were lifted. You'll remember that U.K. citizens we're only allowed to lead their country for major reasons. And this is where constraints were lifted a few weeks ago with release of those restrictions. So we're going to see an impact of this now on air traffic in upcoming weeks and months.\nI already mentioned this. We took charge of the Manaus airport, and we'll be rolling out there the policies that have shown their effectiveness in Salvador in terms of quality of service, productivity, environmental impact and labor impact, social impact. What seems quite clear to us is just as we've observed regarding our motorways and what we also observe in domestic airport markets when they're in countries such as the U.S. and many Latin American cities that have major domestic airline traffic. People want to travel, people want to fly. And we're going to see the impact of this as soon as any and all restrictions are lifted in the various countries.\nNow in our engineering business lines, works and services, order intake continues to be very high. almost reaching the level of order intake of 2020. And you remember in 2020, we booked several mega orders, truly exceptional ones such as the HS2 high-speed line in the United Kingdom for VINCI Construction.\nIt was a beautiful absolutely tremendous year at VINCI Energy, revenue up -- this is Page 16, Slide 16. Revenue up 10% compared to 2019 and 11% compared to 2020. in spite of delays in supply toward the end of the 2021 period, the supply delays probably delayed some continued job -- continuation of job sites, and that has carried some of -- or postponed them into 2020. So revenue would have probably grown even more if there had been some of these delays in supply, and you're familiar with these types of delays.\nVINCI Energy as I already said, but it's so magnificent, I'd like to repeat it, is yet again improving its EBIT margin reaching 6.5% versus 6% in 2019, which is truly remarkable. And really demonstrates, of course, the resilience but also the robustness and the potential for growth in their business model, VINCI Energy.\nExcellent cash flow generation as well, making it possible to improve by EUR 700 million, the net debt situation for that activity over an annual period. Lastly, in spite of the pandemic, VINCI Energy continued with its strategy of external growth. During 2020 and 2021, there were no fewer than 50 small- and medium-sized businesses that were acquired, integrated into VINCI Energy, producing additional revenue of around EUR 300 million during 2021.\nTo move on to Slide 17 now, you can see here the new Vinci construction after the merger of Eurovia and VINCI Construction. It is keeping its promises. It's revenue up 5% versus 2019, reaching EUR 26.3 billion. We're seeing a ramp-up of the major projects won recently. Also a very good deal flow in terms of order intake is specifically and very important. I'd mention orders for small and medium-sized businesses. It's very important because they make up resilience, help to obtain overall resilience. There's a good order intake, very good order book. Back to the point, makes it possible for us to be confident in VINCI Construction. And look at new projects in highly selective fashion. Another important point, our EBIT margin is up significantly, 3.7% versus 3.3% in 2019, and it should continue to grow.\nLastly, we're seeing excellent cash generation, making it possible to improve by more than EUR 1.1 billion, the overall net debt for the annual period. Bottom right of the screen, you can see we've now achieved VINCI Construction now has just over half of its revenue outside of France. That has been the case for several years at VINCI Energy. It's now the case at VINCI construction as well. This is all fully in sync with our strategy which we embarked upon several years ago now.\nLastly, to talk about property, real estate development, recovered very well after the abrupt shock due to the pandemic. Housing unit reservations slightly above their level in 2019, specifically for managed residences, which are developing well. VINCI Immobilier is the #1 developer to commit to zero soil ceiling, 0 artificialization by 2030, which is 20 years ahead of what's called for in the law called Climate and Resilience. This will make for in-depth profound transformation of property development model. The idea will be to prefer using services that have already been built on, sometimes polluted. And also, it will mean recycling urban recycling services. And when you have to build on greenfield, we will make sure we optimize projects so that we limit to utmost any artificialization of soil during the project. We take into account all 3 components, and that's why we are very much in a position to reach our target of 0 net artificialization as well in property development for the full French scope by 2030.\nI would like to give the floor now to Christian Labeyrie.\n\nChristian Labeyrie\n\nCFO & Executive VP, VINCI SA\n\nThank you, Xavier. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. So I'll go into a little more detail on the figures that Xavier has presented. First of all, revenue, which was up in 2021 and 2020 across all our businesses, because overall, we are up 14%, over EUR 49 billion. And with our VINCI Construction and VINCI Energy, were even above were up 3% on 2019. Over the year, the increase is particularly strong in concessions, even in the airports, whose revenues are very similar to that of 2019. This is not yet the case of VINCI Airport because VINCI Airport is still down at minus 55 on 2019, due to passenger traffic, which is still quite low. VINCI Energy was up 10% both on 2020 and 2019, and VINCI Construction is up over 13% and has now reached a level above that of the precrisis.\nAt constant scope and FX, revenues are up 13% with scope effects representing EUR 500 million in revenue, additional of which EUR 300 million for VINCI Energy. This reflects about 50 acquisitions, of which 30 completed in 2021, mainly in France and Germany and in the United States. We should also point out the 100% control taken of bat promotion, which is a company in which VINCI Immobilier took a 49% stake a few years ago and which has EUR 150 million in revenue for the full year.\nCurrency impact is low. The depreciation of currencies versus the euro offset by appreciation sterling, offset the depreciation of the dollar and some Latin American currencies.\nLooking now at the breakdown of revenue between France and international business in 2021, moving on to the next slide. We see that -- this was a similar increase between France and International, but comparing to 2019, we see that France is back to 2019 levels, whereas international business is up which means that international business in our revenue has increased. It's gone up from 45% in 2019 to 47% in 2021. Of course, this is excluding COBRA, and with COBRA in 2022, over 50% of our revenue will, of course, be generated overseas.\nOperating income, next slide, up strongly, EUR 4.7 billion, up EUR 1.9 billion on last year, but we're still below the 2019 level to the tune of approximately EUR 1 billion. VINCI Autoroutes post results very similar to 2019 and VINCI Airports, as Xavier pointed out, is still showing a loss -- but the good news is that in the second half, VINCI Airport came back with a positive result, reflecting the drastic cuts that were implemented after the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020.\nWe're very happy with the results of VINCI Energy and VINCI Construction, whose results are up strongly, EUR 1 billion in revenue for both of these businesses, 50 basis points more margin. Most of the business in the geographies have contributed to this very strong overall performance, with the strongest synergies in the sector. VINCI Construction in its new structure with Eurovia has a margin of 3.7 versus 3.3 in 2019. it had not reached this level for many years. This increase reflects cuts in previous losses through the reorganization of the business in oil and gas in 2021 and completion of some difficult project.\nThe first positive impact of the merger between VINCI Construction and year-over-year, this improves profitability in 2019 with a significant increase in VINCI Construction, whose margin stood at 3%. SG&A approximately 3%, which was the margin that you've become accustomed to. And as VINCI Immobilier, although the amount is lower, it still shows a strong increase on last year, but unfortunately, we have not yet gone back to 2020, pre '21 levels due to increases in the cost of land and technical costs.\nSo looking at the income statement, operating income in construction, where we had a loss previously -- we are now back to a positive result this year, even though we have not yet gone back to the very high level of 2019, but it's still an improvement. The financial result here is slightly up on previous years, reflecting variation in the other direction. We've reduced the euro and the cost of debt in euro, with a coupon of close to 0 for and the amortization of long-standing debt for Cofiroute. And we're continuing to reduce the cost of debt in euro and we had to pay more for sterling debt in order to refinance London Gatwick. So the financial result, we have a very strong increase in corporate tax, double that of last level -- last year's level. We have a nonrecurring item of EUR 400 million which is the impact on deferred tax liability of the increase on corporate tax in the U.K. starting 2023. It's not a cash impact, but it does have an impact on our results and the EUR 200 million in the bottom line. So overall, EUR 2.6 billion is the net result of a double that of last year which was a low level, a low base and not quite back to 2019, and we hope to reach that this year. If we adjust for U.K. tax, that's 2.5 billion in income generated this year.\nNext slide. What is the analysis and debt variation. -- with an increase in debt of EUR 1.3 billion or EUR 18 billion to EUR 19.5 billion. But this takes into account the check we wrote for 4.2 to acquire ICS. And this -- we have free cash flow of EUR 5.3 billion, which is a historic level, historic record versus EUR 4 billion last year and EUR 4.2 billion in 2019. EBITDA, not back to 2019, but quite close to that EUR 7.9 billion. Working capital requirement, EUR 1.6 billion, further improvement, not quite as good as last year, but much better than what we usually have with a strong contribution from VINCI Energy and VINCI Construction. That's the blue or green shaded part of the chart. CapEx really kept under control, even down CapEx from EUR 2.9 billion to EUR 2.5 billion over 3 years with a carry over the investment in airports. But part of this is due to a genuine reduction and impact of acquisitions, namely that of Cobra.\nDividends and miscellaneous up to the tune of EUR 2 billion. We have the dividend which was paid in 2021 to the tune of EUR 550 million share buybacks, which picked up again from October and now stand at 200 million per year, EUR 600 million over 3 months. So those are the flows for 2021. So what you should keep in mind is the free cash flow, which is really exceptional EUR 5.3 billion.\nSo if we analyze how we built up this free cash flow, well, you can see the profile of cash flow over the past 3 years, which makes it very difficult to make forecasts. I'm usually very cautious, as you know, when you asked for guidance on free cash flow in November 2021, we're at EUR 3.4 billion, which was slightly up that of 2019, whereas we only had EUR 2 billion in free cash flow in 2020. But we were expecting that December given the fact that we have a lot of cash inflows from VINCI Construction that we would have EUR 1 billion in December as was the case in 2019 and not 2020 which (inaudible) which was 2 years and what happened in 2021 is exceptional because we generated in December, EUR 2 billion in cash flow to achieve the front level of EUR 5.3 billion. But that was -- you will understand very difficult to to forecast the major part of comop Construction's cash flow is achieved in the last -- in the closing months of the year, and the same goes for VINCI Energy. So we always prefer to be prudent in our forecast when we give guidance on free cash flow.\nNext chart shows that we have moved above a threshold here looking back over the past 10 years. We had EUR 2 billion, EUR 2.5 billion of free cash flow per year. And now we've moved to EUR 3 billion to EUR 3.5 billion. And over the past 3 years, we've done about GBP 4 billion, and now we're over GBP 5 billion. But what I would say is that we should not extrapolate that level for the next year. That would not be reasonable given the impact of what happened in December '20, 2021. But perhaps EUR 5 billion will be a sort of benchmark if we want to come up with a reliable forecast for the years ahead.\nVINCI's balance sheet is very strong. It comes as no surprise to you, notwithstanding the acquisition of Cobra accounting for EUR 4.2 billion in our committed capital, which is still below that of 2 years ago. And as you can see, we have a strong increase to EUR 4.7 billion in working capital over the same period.\nShareholders' equity is up -- and net debt is actually down by EUR 2.4 billion, even though we paid out, as I said, EUR 4.2 billion net cash to acquire COBRA.\nSo next slide, nothing new. We still have a high level of liquidity, EUR 18 billion, which is the level of 2020 almost, even though we have the acquisition of Cobra to account for unused credit lines to the tune of EUR 8.5 billion with EUR 500 million of COBRA. And credit ratings, we haven't seen S&P yet. We will be soon, but I think we'll we should be looking quite good. And we hope to keep our long-term rating stable at S&P. And with Moody's. As I said, we issued a (inaudible) bond with a coupon close to 0. And we also redeemed just over EUR 1 billion of Cofiroute bond, which has contributed to reducing the cost of debt in the same token, we refinanced in order to avoid any liquidity concerns the debt of Gatwick to the tune of EUR 750 billion. That's a high cost because interest rates are starting higher than for euro we had to pay the price for that in order to refinance.\nAnd my last slide. I recall that over the past the cost of debt has constantly gone down, even though the structure of debt currency has changed. Five years ago, it was almost entirely in euro denominated. And now with Gatwick American concessions and acquisitions in the dollar region, we now have net debt, which is only 59% in euros and 41% non-euro-denominated. And this means that looking to the next 2 years, I don't think we're going to be able to significantly go below that. We'll probably have to go slightly up given what has been done by the central banks.\n\nXavier M. P. Huillard\n\nChairman & CEO, VINCI SA\n\nThank you very much, Christian. Thank you, this is for all these reasons, we are moving on to 2022 very commonly and confidently. Well, because our businesses, construction, energy and mobility place us at the very core of the main challenges worldwide. These challenges are to transform our cities and buildings to make them more sustainable, more virtuous from a point of view of the environment and energy usage, and also more pleasant to live. Other challenges such as the bringing the digital revolution into all of our industries and human activities, decarbonizing mobility, all forms of mobility, stepping up energy transition by developing green electricity within the energy mix. enabling the development of low carbon hydrogen, which is a prerequisite for several industries. And in our opinion, is going to develop in the area of heavy traffic, heavy transportation, such as trucks. We also have to systematically look at projects from the vantage point of their carbon footprint and preserving biodiversity. We're to further develop the circular economy to reduce our impact on global nonrenewable resources.\nVINCI is very much involved in all of these challenges and is able to provide solutions to all of these challenges, which all of our 250,000 employees are very excited about, and these are also major growth drivers for us in the future.\nLet's now come back specifically to 2022. There are a couple of slides on '22, one on motorways and one on airports. Now our belief is regarding VINCI Autoroutes, we've seen good trends in recent months. This is visible on the slide here, on Vinci Autoroutes. This should be Page 31. Our expectation is annual traffic in '22 that will be above traffic we booked in 2019.\nAt VINCI Airports, you'll remember its positioning is more in the area of tourism and discretionary travel versus business. And it's different from other major airport players. We've got about a split of 80/20. This is why we believe this will help us recover, continue turning around air traffic in 2022. Our central scenario is that -- in 2022, we should reach about 60%, 6-0 percent, of the 2019 level for the full year. The figure of 60% is very important because 60% would mean we'd produce at VINCI Airports a net income, which would be near breakeven.\nAt VINCI Energy, we feel we should continue growing, all the while keeping a high EBIT margin as booked in 2021.\nAt VINCI Construction, the intention is not necessarily to focus on growth as such, but first and foremost, to continue growing the EBIT margin becoming even more selective than we were in previous years. So all in all, taking to account all of this, our belief is in 2022, our net income will be above the net income that we booked in 2019.\nThis is the confidence that makes it possible for the Board of Directors to propose to the next Annual General Meeting on 12th April a dividend of EUR 2.90 per share. I'd remind you, point 65 cents was already paid as an interim dividend at the end of 2021. The dividend is, of course, taking into account the recovery, the rebound we've talked to you about. It's also taking into account the record level of free cash flow. And first and foremost, shows the great confidence we have in the future.\nAt this juncture, usually, I talked to a bit of our environmental and social policies. We have some slides on this in your booklets. But I believe in the next few minutes, it probably is more interesting to use the opportunity to give you greater detail about COBRA IS. COBRA IS is a group of companies active throughout the value chain of energy, i.e., in engineering, construction, maintenance, Furthermore, they're able to develop, finance and operate renewable energy facilities.\nCOBRA IS has about 45% of its revenues in Spain, 9% in the rest of Europe, 34% in the Americas, mainly in Latin America, 12% rest of the world, particularly Asia, Oceania. All of this via flow business, which means small and medium-sized deals through a network of around 450 business units, which are well rooted in several different management regions. This flow business varies from 1 year to the next, but it's around 67% of the total revenue of Cobra IS. The remainder is Other projects, multi expertise projects were integrated ones, larger ones, usually, usually bigger than EUR 30 million project like VINCI Construction. These can be very large projects, indeed, several hundred million euros.\nSome examples, some very high-voltage power lines and para substations in Brazil. These are easily done through PPP contracts. Some of these 500,000 volts. I don't know if that means anything to you but this is a lot, covering 1,000 kilometers in Amazon Forestland. Another example of power plant cogeneration, 350 megawatts in Mexico. These are operations that have already been done and several of them are currently underway. Critical command and control systems, supervision of road infrastructure and tunnel infrastructure, an example in Australia. Cobra in this segment has developed its own solution which is already outfitted 2,500 kilometers of roads and 3,000 kilometers of tunnels. Another example, offshore platforms for collecting and transforming electricity from offshore wind farms as (inaudible) with equipment vendors such as Siemens, ABB and GE. Clearly, potential in this area is quite significant in all geographies and especially in Europe and the United States, at least for the time being, I suspect this will change. But for the time being, there are few groups able to provide these highly complex services because there's a blend here of metal structures, electromechanical equipment that's often high voltage. And much of this being done at sea, which makes things even more complex. I think of 2 projects we have in partnership with Simmons that are underway right now for the North Sea client is Tenant.\nNow of course, Cobra is involved in renewable energy production fields. They were the first in Spain, to be active here as a builder, OPC as our phraseology or more broadly as a developer, constructor builder. Cobra, first of all, began with pilot projects around 25 years ago. And now gradually has done renewable energy fields via 50 land wind farms, around 2 gigawatts in all. They've had several thermal solar projects and 36 photovoltaic fields all in all, producing 2 gigawatts. These assets are in operation already. Generally speaking, they were sold by Cobra at their parent company during their ready-to-build stage or ready to reduce stage, which is why we didn't take over assets in operation, we took over the development platform as well as its project pipeline which are now very much part of the VINCI Group.\nRenewable energy market, as you know, is growing strongly. Cobra's portfolio, which is currently being developed, varying degrees of maturity, representing approximately just over 14 gigawatts total potential installed capacity, 25% of which is onshore wind, 75% of which is photovoltaic located -- well, 35% of it located in the Iberian Peninsula, 65% located internationally. Plus there's some biomass projects, as well as some offshore wind projects.\nI'd suggest that quickly to wrap up, we talked you through a couple of these projects. We have slides on these toward the end of your booklets. The first slide, Slide #43, this is a project in Brazil it's a photovoltaic project. It's a pretty big one. The power is 570 megawatts. The project is almost ready to build. It will be in the very near future and CapEx in euros will be approximately EUR 350 million. Very interesting to observe that. This gives you an idea of the magnitude of the CapEx cost of a 1 gigawatt project. You can do the calculation 1 gigawatt of photovoltaic cost approximately EUR 620 million. This project was foreseen. Electricity selling will take place 50/50 through merchant called PPAs, 50% sold through the market. Market prices, as you know, in the spot market for green energy market prices are quite high, well above what you could get after negotiating a PPA. This project, just like in the following projects, IRR -- project IRR we would call high single digit, something is even better than that.\nThe second project I wanted to mention to you -- this one is in Ecuador. It's an onshore wind project, a concession covering 25 years, ready to build in the very near future in all likelihood in the next few weeks or months. Ready to build means you've got all the permits and authorizations, the right to connect, authorizations to build the connection lines and to in this instance, install the wind turbines, plus the environmental permits. Only once you're in that situation and you've got the actual ability to put together the funding in line with expected\n(technical difficulty)\nwell above photovoltaic that I mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, the producible, i.e., ability to produce power is greater in wind due to greater regularity of electricity production from wind production Wind blows even at night when there is no light for your photovoltaic panels.\nSo the third project is located in Spain. This is Photovoltaic project, power 140.4 megawatts. We hope it will be ready to build midway through 2022 CapEx EUR 72 million. You can also calculate the amount of EUR 630 million per megawatt in this area of photovoltaic.\nA last point the Morecambe project in the Irish Sea. This is an offshore wind project won in the first half of 2020. It's an exceptional site. Firstly, it's near the coast. Next, the geotechnical conditions are good. A lot of development time is required. Offshore wind, one of the features here is that it takes years between the time you begin your development, and you can actually begin generating power usually, in this type of project like in the Iberia Sea, we're hoping to reach ready to build by 2026, which means 4 years down the road because we have to fine-tune geotechnical knowledge due the environmental studies on flora and fauna in this area of the sea. Then we have to do all of this detailed engineering studies, including the power outflow line that you use to connect to the land power grid.\nThen one very last slide. This is on the Kincardine project. in the North Sea. It's not a concession. We didn't take over the concession portion of the state at ACS. We just took over the construction portion, which is now completed, wrapped up around September of 2021. This is an experimental pilot operation of floating offshore wind farm, a special feature here. It won't be the case for very long. Things are changing. But for the time being, this is the facility using the most powerful turbines in the area of offshore floating offshore wind farms. Floating offshore wind is the new frontier. This way, you can make the facilities more distant from people who live on the coast. They don't see them from the coast. This reduces the constraints. You can use larger surface areas of the sea since you're far away from the coast. Don't do the calculation of CapEx per gigawatt there because the price is huge. But it's, again, due to the fact that this was an experimental operation, I emphasize that. It was done in very good conditions by Cobra in terms of the EPC. The actual build, it was delivered and it's now producing generating power. Therefore, the authorities that had entrusted the operation to us have also entrusted us with another floating offshore wind project, also in the Steve Docklands. This will be 100 megawatts of capacity.\nThose are our points. Now of course, we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Leila, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Waters Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Dr. Udit Batra, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Additionally, we will comment on the expected timing for completion of Water's pending combination with the Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business, of Becton Dickenson & Company as well as the expected financial and operational impacts of this combination on borders. These statements are only our present expectations based on information available to us as of today.

On today's call, Udit will begin by covering our key messages for the quarter. Amol will then take you through our results and updated guidance in more detail, then we will open the phone line up for questions.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Casper, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying, it is a true privilege to be on this journey with such dedicated and talented colleagues. As I reflect on my 5-year anniversary at Waters, I'm filled with gratitude.\nOver these years, our team has consistently delivered on our commitments and strengthened the foundation of this company. Today, we celebrate another quarter of outstanding commercial momentum. We marked another breakthrough innovation with Xevo CDMS, the next generation of mass spectrometry and prepared to combine with BD's Bioscience and Diagnostic Solutions business, ushering in an exciting new era for Waters.\nNow turning to our third quarter results. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter with top and bottom line results exceeding the high end of our guidance. This performance reflects the combined positive impact of innovation and execution, along with clear benefits from our strategic expansion into high-growth areas. It also reflects the dedication and hard work of our teams whose focus on customers, science and operational excellence continues to power Water's success.\nWe achieved strong results in the third quarter. Sales grew 8% as reported and 8% in constant currency. Instruments grew 6%, led by high single-digit growth in our LC/MS portfolio. Recurring revenue grew 9%, driven by 7% service growth and 13% chemistry growth. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 16% to $3.40, which was $0.20 above the midpoint of our guidance. A year ago, we signaled the start of a new instrument replacement cycle. Since then, sales activity has surged and our momentum has continued to build. We see meaningful runway ahead as customers progress through the multiyear process of replacing their aged instrument fleets. Instrument growth is currently tracking at a low single-digit CAGR versus 2019, reflecting steady mean reversion toward the long-term historical rate of 5%.\nBeyond replacement activity, customers are increasingly choosing Waters for new capacity investments, setting us up well for the years ahead. Our idiosyncratic growth drivers, GLP-1 testing, PFAS testing and India generics continue to perform very well. At the same time, our innovative products are also solving clear unmet needs in bioanalytical characterization and gaining adoption. As reported, instrument sales grew 11% quarter-over-quarter, representing the largest third quarter ramp in our company's history outside of the 2020 COVID year, with orders once again exceeding shipments. The strong sequential performance underscores the strong momentum in our business. Year-over-year, Alliance IS sales grew over 30% in as the customer adoption of our flagship HPLC product remains a clear success.\nXevo TQ Absolute platforms grew 30%, with continued strength bolstered by the launch of the new Xevo TQ Absolute XR earlier this year. GLP-1 testing-related revenue more than doubled, reflecting continued wins in development and manufacturing settings in the Americas and Europe, along with expanding demand from genetic semaglutide manufacturing build-outs in India. PFAS growth remains robust with orders growing approximately 30%, similar to last quarter. We saw strength across all major regions, highlighted by strong demand in Japan as labs prepare for new drinking water regulations and continued momentum from U.S. federal, state and municipal labs.\nOur India team once again delivered excellent performance with revenue up high teens. This was driven by strong demand from genetics manufacturers and CDMOs as we continue to benefit from volume growth trends tied to the ongoing patent cliff of blockbuster drugs. Further enhancing our core performance are the unique capabilities we've built to address unmet needs in large molecule workflows. We are seeing clear progress in bioseparations and bioanalytical characterization reflecting the success of our deliberate long-term strategy and the investments we've made, both organically and through our acquisition of Wyatt.\nIn bioanalytical characterization, we saw strong growth of multi-angle light scattering instruments in pharma QA/QC applications as large pharma began new waves of instrument purchasing in quality labs. This was enabled by the recent launch of Empower onto wired light scattering platforms. BioCode system sales also saw strong growth, underscoring the sustained momentum and expanding adoption of this platform in the bioprocessing domain as customers increasingly standardize on its proven performance and ease of use in routine large molecule workflows.\nIn the quarter, chemistry grew 13%, and fueled by the positive market reception of our newly launched SEC and Affinity bioseparation columns with strength that more than offset pull-forward dynamics from the second quarter. Bioseparations grew more than 20% with small molecule applications growing 10%. 5 years ago, Waters Max peak premier columns set a new standard of performance in reverse phase separations across both small and large molecule pharmaceutical applications.\nToday, this high-performance surface technology remains the benchmark for customers seeking the clearest peaks, maximum reproducibility and highest confidence in results. All of this helps accelerate analytical decisions across discovery, development and manufacturing. Since 2023, we have made further advances in combining the bio inert benefits of Max peak Premier with our novel innovations in other chromatography techniques such as size exclusion chromatography and affinity chromatography, both critical to bioseparations. These products have an immediate success serving pre and post clinical development and manufacturing applications of novel large molecule therapeutics. New products launched over the past 5 years grew approximately 50% in the quarter and have been a key contributor to our 11% year-to-date chemistry growth. By end market, our results were led by pharma which grew 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Americas and Asia and high single-digit growth in Europe.\nIn Asia, we saw particularly strong growth in China, where pharma sales grew by more than 20%, reflecting continued spending improvement amongst Chinese CDMOs and biotech customers. In our Industrial segment, sales grew mid-single digits, with the TA division returning to positive growth sooner than expected. In the Academic and Government segment, sales grew 1%, driven by stimulus tender wins in China and a lower-than-expected decline in the United States, where our teams delivered strong results at customers' fiscal year-end.\nOur growth strategy is delivering, driving exceptional performance and positioning us for sustained momentum ahead. At the same time, the external environment continues to improve across our key end markets, supported by more stable global trade conditions and a clearer policy backdrop for our pharma customers.\nWith our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our full year 2025 guidance. We now expect constant currency sales growth in the range of 6.7% to 7.3%. This represents a 7% midpoint, which is an increase from our prior outlook. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance and now expect a range of $13.05 to $13.15, which represents double-digit growth.\nLooking ahead to 2026, we are well positioned to build on our momentum. The same growth drivers that have powered our performance this year, instrument replacement, higher service attachment and increased product adoption through e-commerce will remain key contributors. We also expect the innovation tied to our idiosyncratic growth drivers and our unique offerings within bio separations and bioanalytical characterizations to deliver a sustained contribution to our growth. This puts us in a fantastic position to deliver strong performance again in 2026, further reinforcing our outlook for next year, we are launching a wave of new products that build on our recent success. At the same time, our pending combination with BD's Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business, represents a powerful catalyst for near-term synergy realization and long-term value creation. A few weeks ago, we launched our Xevo charge detection mass spectrometer, which marks a new era in mass spectrometry. It is a perfect example of how our team takes complex technology that meet clear unmet needs and turns them into simple and easy-to-use instruments without losing the sophistication of the measurement.\nXevo CDMS represents a transformative breakthrough in bioanalytical characterization. It enables direct high-resolution measurement of largest and most complex therapeutics in high-volume applications. The system is a major advancement offering faster results, easier operation and requiring much smaller sample sizes and traditional methods such as ultracentrifugation.\nIt provides process development and lot release characterization insights up to 10x faster while requiring 1% of the sample volume accelerating what was previously required days of analysis. This launch is relevant for 40% of the large molecule pharmaceutical pipeline and serves a total [indiscernible] approximately $350 million, which is growing between high single digits and low double digits. We also have exciting updates ahead for Empower, which has long set the standard for compliant informatics and pharmaceutical applications. It is used in more than 80% of novel drug approvals by the FDA, EMA and China's NMPA. Over the last several years, we have steadily expanded the value and reach of Empower, adding new detectors to the platform.\nEarlier this year, for example, we successfully launched multi-angle light scattering from our acquisition of [indiscernible] on to Empower. These advancements are helping us extend Empower's leadership from small molecule analysis into the faster-growing large molecule applications where biologics and complex modalities now represent more than half of the global pharma pipeline. Looking ahead, Empower will continue to evolve as a more complete panel for bioanalytical characterization across multiple techniques, including flow cytometry, creating a unified, compliant data environment for our customers' most advanced analytical workflows.\nIn 2026, we we will begin a significant release cadence introducing a series of premium features that will progressively evolve Empower into a modern, connected and more intelligent platform. These cloud-native features will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce manual interventions, save analyst time and minimize compliance risks from human error, which are all key value drivers in QA/QC labs. They will also enhance instrument utilization and uptime through predictive maintenance and automated operational insights. The value add that these new features offer will answer our customers' unmet needs and will help accelerate our customers as transition from a perpetual license model to a subscription-based model where we are already seeing growing traction with several large pharma customers. This shift will unlock long-term growth accretion within informatics and deepen customer engagement across Waters' digital ecosystem.\nFurther development could expand the opportunity ahead in bioanalytical characterization came last week as the U.S. FDA issued new draft guidance aimed at modernizing and accelerating the development of biosimilar drugs. The proposed framework will reduce the need for routine comparative clinical efficacy studies and instead rely primarily on advanced analytical characterization. This could represent a meaningful shift towards analytical testing becoming the primary gatekeeper for biosimilar approval which has the potential to increase demand for analytical instruments and compliance-ready workflows such as our BioCore LCMS system, multi-angle light scattering and flow cytometry.\nTaken together, these developments strengthen our confidence in the high-growth opportunity that exists in the years ahead across bio separations, bioanalytical characterization and large molecule compliant informatics. Now turning to our pending combination with BD's Bioscience and Diagnostic Solutions business. We have a compelling opportunity to create value for our shareholders and begin realizing year 1 synergies following completion of the transaction.\nOur goal is to hit the ground running and quickly apply the same execution and operational discipline that has defined Waters over the past few years. Integration planning is well underway and progressing rapidly. We've hosted 2 highly energizing integration summits at our Milford headquarters, bringing together 120 leaders from both organizations to establish a unified vision. We have refined our pre-day 1, day 1 and day 100 master plans and achieved alignment on operationalization of transition service agreements in collaboration with the BD team.\nAnd we are well on our way to readying our synergy delivery action plan, 6 big business unit work streams and 10 functional work streams are now fully mobilized and focused on day 1 readiness. We remain on track to complete the combination of BD's Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters Corporation around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026.\nI will now turn the call over to Amol to cover our financial results in more detail and provide further details on our guidance.\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered sales of $800 million up 8% as reported and 8% in constant currency. Momentum remained strong with as reported sales increasing 4% quarter-over-quarter, while orders continue to outpace shipments leading to backlog growth. By end market, pharma grew 11%. Industrial grew 4% and academic and government grew 1%.\nIn pharma, all major geographies grew high single digits or above led by low double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia. This trend reflects robust instrument replacement activity key wins in greenfield CapEx projects, such as those related to our idiosyncratic growth drivers and new instrument system deployment in bioanalytical characterization. We also saw significant market uptake on our new chemistry products such as those serving bioseparations which grew mid-double digits. In Industrial, Waters provision grew mid-single digits led by mid-teens growth in food and environmental testing where we facilitated demand has remained a key growth driver.\nPA performed better than expected and returned to growth with sales up 2% as improving macro sentiment grow stronger customer spending. In academic and government, growth was led by China, which grew approximately 20% as we leveraged our local presence and new product innovation to capture stimulus tender opportunities. Meanwhile, the Americas saw a low single-digit decline as spending came in better than reflected in our assumptions. By region, Asia grew 13%, while Europe and the Americas, each grew 5%. In China, sales grew 12%, driven by double-digit growth in pharma and academic and government.\nIndia grew in high teens, reflecting continued strength in pharma generics where we are benefiting from the ongoing patent cliff. By product line, instrument sales grew 6%, led by high single-digit growth in LC/MS systems, reflecting continued strong performance as we move beyond the first year of the instrument replacement cycle.\nRecurring revenues grew 9% with service up 7% and chemistry up 13%. Our strong chemistry performance was driven by price optimization and volume growth in small and large molecule applications and new product introductions, which more than offset the pull-forward dynamics from the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.40, representing 16% growth. GAAP earnings per share were $2.50.\nGross margin for the quarter was 59%, which was a 70 basis point sequential increase versus the prior quarter, reflecting normalization of tariff remediation costs. Adjusted operating margin was 30.3%. Our operating tax rate came in at approximately 14%. Free cash flow was $160 million after funding $25 million of capital expenditures and $14 million of transaction-related expenses. Our net debt stood at $948 million at the end of the quarter.\nNow I will share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide our fourth quarter guidance. Our growth strategy is delivering, driving exceptional performance and positioning us for sustained momentum ahead. At the same time, the external environment continues to improve across our key end markets, supported by more stable global trade conditions and a clearer policy backdrop for our pharma customers.\nWith our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our full year 2025 constant currency sales growth guidance now to a 7% midpoint in the range of 6.7% to 7.3%. Net of currency translation, full year reported sales growth is now expected to be in a range of 6.5% to 7.1%. We expect full year 2025 gross margin to be approximately 59.2% above our prior outlook and adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 31%.\nBelow the line, we expect $36 million in net interest expense and average diluted share count of $59.7 million and tax rate of 16.5%. With these updates, we are raising our full year 2025 adjusted earnings per fully diluted share guidance to the range of $13.05 to $13.15. This is approximately 10% to 11% growth. This guidance incorporates the expected impact of the current tariff structure on our business including the recent increases in tariff rates since our last update.\nTurning to the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect constant currency sales growth in the range of 5% to 7%. And Net of currency translation, reported sales growth is expected to be 5.2% to 7.2%. At the midpoint, this guidance assumes a 16% quarter-over-quarter increase in the reported sales between the third and the fourth quarter, prudently below the seasonal pattern we observed last year. We also have one additional day in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, representing roughly 100 basis points tailwind to recurring revenue sales growth. We anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $4.45 and $4.55, which reflects a year-over-year growth of approximately 9% to 11%.\nWith that, I will now hand it back to Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, momentum in our business remains strong. We have continued to deliver high single-digit growth as we move into the second year of the instrument replacement cycle. -- driven by consistent execution and the positive impact of innovation across our portfolio.\nReflecting this trend, our raised full year -- full year 2025 outlook now calls for high single-digit sales growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint, underscoring the success of our global teams delivering on our long-term growth strategy. Looking ahead, we will enter 2026 with a robust cadence of breakthrough product launches, expanding adoption in large molecule applications and an exciting opportunity to unlock meaningful near-term synergies and long-term value creation through our pending combination with BD's Bioscience and Diagnostic Solutions business.\nI will now turn the call back to Casper.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to open the lines and take your questions."

Actual events or results may differ materially from the statements made on today's call. Please see the risk factors included within our Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs, our other SEC filings and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide presentation accompanying today's call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call on a comparable constant currency basis.

Amol will then take you through our results and updated guidance in more detail. After that, Udit will then share facts on key topics related to our pending combination with the BD Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business. Then we will open the phone line up for questions.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with sales again above the high end of our guidance. This performance reflects strong execution, revitalized innovation and our successful expansion into higher growth areas, 3 strategic pillars we set in motion 5 years ago and continue to deliver with strength and resilience.\nSales grew 9% as reported and 8% in constant currency. Instruments grew mid-single digits, led by high single-digit growth in our LC and mass spec portfolio. Recurring revenue grew 11%, driven by 9% service growth and double-digit chemistry growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.95, up 12% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. GAAP EPS was $2.47. Sales growth was led by Waters Division, which grew in the high single digits or better across Americas, Europe and Asia.\nIn the Americas, this growth was partially offset by weakness in the TA division, in macro-sensitive polymer and materials testing applications. By end market, Pharma grew low double digits, led by strong instrument replacement activity and new product adoption particularly among large pharma and CDMO customers. In our nonpharma segments, Industrial grew 6% and academic and government performed better than expected, declining low single digits. Within recurring revenue, chemistry benefited from approximately $8 million of sales pulled forward in the second quarter related to tariff dynamics. Excluding this, our overall constant currency growth rate was 7% with chemistry up 10%.\nThese results reflect solid progress against our strategy, which has remained anchored in 3 core principles: First, commercial execution. We have driven consistently strong commercial execution across our organization in a highly systematized KPI-oriented approach. So far, in 2025, each of our key initiatives is ahead of expectations towards our 2030 targets.\nIn the first half of 2025 service plan attachment has risen 200 basis points to 52%, which is -- which already more than doubles our 100 basis point expansion objective for the year. E-commerce adoption continues to advance and is now comfortably above 40% of our chemistry revenue. We have also increased our CDMO penetration with contract organizations now at 27% of our pharma revenue.\nSecond, revitalizing our innovation. Our recent product launches continue to gain strong traction. Alliance iS sales grew 300% year-over-year in the quarter, while Xevo TQ Absolute platforms grew 40% and continue to lead the market with exceptional robustness and sensitivity. Customer response to the Xevo TQ Absolute XR has been outstanding, with Q2 orders more than double our expectations. Its robustness was recently demonstrated by one of our leading customers who was able to complete over 30,000 uninterrupted plasma injections.\nMaxPeak premier columns, which represent high-performance chemistry for complex separations again, grew north of 30% in Q2. We recently launched our BioResolve Protein A affinity columns, marking the first set of affinity columns we have brought to market in bioseparations. Additionally, we have put light scattering on Empower ahead of target and customer sales are already coming in.\nThird, capturing long-term growth accretion vectors in our core business and moving into high-growth adjacencies. Our idiosyncratic growth drivers have meaningfully outpaced our targets. In the first half of 2025, GLP testing revenue grew 70% year-over-year. PFAS testing revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and India revenues grew in the high teens. We also delivered 200 basis points of price contribution both in the quarter and for the first half of the year. We're proud of Water's progress and are continuing to see robust momentum in our business.\nWith that in mind, we're raising our full year 2025 constant currency sales growth guidance to 5.5% to 7.5% and raising our full year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $12.95 to $13.05.\nI will now turn the call over to Amol to cover our financial results in more detail and provide further details on our guidance.\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $771 million, up 9% as reported and 8% in constant currency. Orders outpaced sales reflecting solid momentum and setting us up well for further strength in the second half of the year. By end market, performance was led by Pharma, which grew 11% and Industrial, which grew 6%. Academic and government declined 3%. In Pharma, the Americas, Europe and Asia each grew double digits. In Industrial, Waters Division grew mid-teens with strong growth in food and environmental testing. PFAS-related applications again grew significantly, up more than 30% in the quarter. TA declined 6% due to softness in Americas and Europe, for macro sensitive segments such as materials and polymer testing.\nIn ANG, we executed well and stayed close to our customers, delivering a resilient outcome. The Americas declined low single digits, which was better than reflected in our assumptions. China ANG grew high single digits as we leverage our local presence and new product innovations to win similar standard opportunities.\nBy region, Europe grew 8%, Asia grew 14%, driven by double-digit growth in China, India and Japan. The Americas grew 2% as low double-digit pharma growth was partially offset by softness in TA and academic and government. By product line, instrument sales grew 4% led by high single-digit growth in LC and MaxPeak systems as new product demand and replacement trends remain robust.\nRecurring revenue grew low double digits with service up 9% and chemistry up 16%. In the quarter, chemistry benefited from approximately $8 million of sales pulled forward. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.95, representing 12% growth or 11% growth on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share were $2.47. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.3%, and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, reflecting the impact of regional sales mix and margin dilution from tariff surcharges. Our operating tax rate came in at 17.9% due to jurisdictional mix and discrete items specific to the quarter, creating a $0.05 headwind to adjusted EPS. We expect this to normalize in the second half of the year.\nFree cash flow was $159 million after funding $23 million of capital expenditures. In the quarter, we made $120 million of U.S. tax reform payment and paid other items totaling $20 million. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. Looking ahead, we plan to use our free cash flow to pay down $100 million of debt and add to our cash position in the second half of the year.\nNow I will share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide our third quarter guidance. We are executing well across our commercial priorities and momentum remains robust. Given these dynamics, we are raising our full year constant currency sales growth guidance to 5.5% to 7.5%. We are also raising our reported sales growth guidance now to the range of 5% and to 7%.\nWe expect full year 2025 gross margin to be approximately 59% and adjusted operating margin to be approximately 31%. Below the line, we expect $40 million of net interest expense, 59.7 million average diluted share count and a 16.7% tax rate. With our strong sales momentum, we are also raising our EPS guidance. We now expect full year 2025 adjusted earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $12.95 to $13.05. This is approximately 9% to 10% growth.\nWhile the current tariff landscape has improved versus our prior guidance assumptions, given the continued variability of tariffs and trade policy environment, our tariff impact outlook for the second half of 2025 is unchanged. If tariff rates were to remain only at current levels, there is approximately $0.06 of upside to our full year adjusted EPS guidance.\nTurning to the third quarter of 2025, we expect constant currency sales growth of 5% to 7%. Net of currency translation, the reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5%. For EPS, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.15 and $3.25. This represents approximately 8% to 11% growth.\nWith that, I will now hand it back to Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. The momentum in our core business remains strong. This trend provides the foundation for the next phase of growth as we combine with BD's Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business. Consistent with our strategy, the transaction accelerates our entry into multiple high-growth adjacencies. It also extends the reach of our proven execution model into other attractive high-volume segments. The combined company anchored by leading brands generating 80% of the revenue and a 70% annual recurring base create a powerful engine for consistent growth and will drive resilience across future CapEx cycles. Paired with highly attained cost and revenue synergies, this positions the company for an impressive financial trajectory with 7% top line and mid-teens adjusted EPS annualized CAGR growth on a combined company basis.\nI will now share some facts that address several key questions we have been getting from the investor community. Covering, first, our growth assumptions for BD Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions on a stand-alone basis; second, our assumptions behind the cost and revenue synergies; third, the fit and quality of the microbiology business and the value creation upside opportunity that it holds; and fourth, integration leadership. Beginning with our growth assumptions for the BD Bioscience and diagnostic solutions on a stand-alone basis.\nFrom fiscal year 2019 to 2024, BD's Biosciences and Diagnostics businesses grew at a combined 5% CAGR driven by approximately 5.5% growth in Biosciences and 4.5% in diagnostics. The Biosciences figure includes the recent slowdown in drug discovery which has reduced CAGR growth by 150 basis points over this time frame. Adjusting for this, the underlying growth potential of the BD business is between 5.5% and 6% backed by long-term historical trends.\nIn recent quarters, the business has experienced 3 temporary growth headwinds: one, softness in pharma drug discovery and U.S. academic and government funding; two, a short-term supply disruption affecting the [indiscernible] microbiology platform; and three, a U.S. export ban on flow cytometry products to China. We believe that the [indiscernible] supply constraints have been alleviated with utilization ramping back up across sites. At the same time, U.S. export licenses have been reinstated across high parameter flow cytometry access to China, resolving this issue.\nFor pharma research and academic and government, we have taken a conservative approach in our growth rate assumptions to reflect ongoing industry headwinds. Our model prudently assumes a 40% decline in U.S. ANG funding through 2027 and flat revenue growth in pharma drug discovery in both 2026 and 2027 after the baseline is reset this year in 2025. Importantly, BD's Bioscience and diagnostic solutions exposure to U.S., ANG and pharma drug discovery is limited at a low-teens percentage of revenue.\nPutting these facts together, we estimate that the underlying BD Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business will gradually return to growth through the rest of calendar year 2025. We expect a slight decline in the quarter ending June 30 with further sequential growth rate improvement and a return to positive growth in the second half of calendar year -- of the calendar year, all of which is reflected in our model. We then expect it to reach 4.5% growth in 2026, 5% growth in 2027 before then progressing back to its historical growth rate of mid-single digit plus in 2028 and beyond.\nWhen combined with a risk-adjusted $290 million in revenue synergies we've laid out, the expected growth expected total growth profile of BD Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions is 7% on a CAGR basis. These synergies are evenly phased over the 5 years as commercial execution will kick into gear quickly while cross-selling and high-growth adjacencies will progressively phase in over time. We also see further upside to this growth as our model does not include growth contributions from much anticipated new product launches, which are expected to positively impact growth in BD's underlying business in 2026. This includes launches across the flow cytometry portfolio, the next-generation [indiscernible] launch in microbiology and other launches across the portfolio, all expected in 2026.\nI recently visited BD San Jose site to see the new fax discover S8 Flow Cytometer in action. It impressively combines spectral and real-time imaging technologies to analyze over cell characteristics with exceptional resolution and sensitivity. Many customers had delayed flow purchases in anticipation of this significant innovation with availability now in market, orders are running well ahead of target, just 2 months post launch.\nNow on to cost synergies and revenue synergies from this transaction. We expect to deliver $345 million in adjusted EBITDA synergies by year 5, driven by $200 million in cost by year 3 and $290 million in revenue synergies by year 5. The structure and execution plan behind these numbers gives us confidence in how actionable and achievable they are. On the cost side, the $200 million we outlined represents just under 5% of the combined company's cost base.\nIn my prior role, integrating EMD Millipore and Sigma-Aldrich, we delivered synergies equal to approximately 8% of the total cost base. If we simply match that outcome here, it would fully backstop our entire $345 million adjusted EBITDA synergy target with cost alone. And remember, more recently in 2023, Waters executed a 5% head count reduction in one quarter when demand softened, reducing spans and layers and aligning our cost base to match the changing realities of the market without compromising performance and growth. That same discipline underpins our synergy plans.\nThe $200 million in model cost synergies will come from 3 main areas: split across manufacturing and supply chain, commercial infrastructure and indirect procurement savings [indiscernible] and supply chain, we expect to generate approximately $80 million in savings with $40 million driven by site rationalization. A further $30 million comes from direct procurement savings, which amounts to just 2.5% of our direct material spend compared to a market benchmark of 5%. The remaining $10 million comes from freight lane optimization, which does not include upside potential from additional sourcing leverage.\nCommercial infrastructure service and technology streamlining are expected to contribute $75 million. Nearly half of these savings come from consolidating central functions inside sales and sales operations and do not impact quota-carrying reps or field service engineers. The other half reflects duplicative digital infrastructure and central service oversight as there is no need for multiple CRM systems, e-commerce stacks or service oversight organizations. The final $45 million comes from indirect procurement savings and efficiencies gained by leveraging our global capability center in India.\nWe've taken a deliberately conservative approach, assuming indirect procurement contributes just $20 million or less than 2% of the combined direct spend -- indirect spend. The remainder comes from in-sourcing outsourced services to our global capability center where we already deliver equivalent output at a fraction of the cost. Beyond that, we see meaningful potential upside through rebalancing roles currently concentrated in high-cost geographies across the globe into more cost-efficient hubs and regional low-cost centers offering additional flexibility and long-term scalability to the cost base.\nOn the revenue side, net of risk adjustment, we have mapped out a $290 million opportunity over 5 years that spans 3 clearly defined an execution-ready areas. This includes $150 million from commercial excellence, $115 million from high-growth adjacencies and $60 million from cross-selling. Commercial excellence is built on the same model that transformed Waters over the past 5 years. The BD business we are acquiring closed lead resembles where Waters stood in 2020. 30% of the installed base is due for replacement. 70% of revenue comes from reagents yet only a limited percentage flows through e-commerce and only 40% of the installed base is covered under a service plan. These are all levers we pulled at Waters with dramatic impact.\nBy applying the same playbook to BD, we believe that $115 million is fully within reach. For example, increasing e-commerce attachment by 20% on BD's $1.8 billion reagents business, like we have achieved with Waters, unlocks an estimated $75 million in additional revenue alone. This math is based on what we have seen firsthand at Waters, where an incremental dollar is generated for every $5 shifted to digital. The next $115 million comes from 3 high-growth adjacencies, bioanalytical characterization, bio separations and [indiscernible] in diagnostics, each contributing $35 million to $40 million.\nIn bioanalytical characterization, flow cytometry and PCR are playing a growing role in large molecule QA/QC testing, bringing these technologies on to Empower will immediately enhance their capabilities and utility in regulated labs like how we integrated [indiscernible] earlier this year. For prudence, our $40 million revenue synergy estimate only reflects adoption in process development labs and does not include the larger QA/QC opportunity. Meanwhile, we know firsthand that a leading cell therapy manufacturer is actively looking to deploy flow cytometry in QA/QC for production, but has been held back by the lack of compliance, enabling informatics like Empower.\nIn Bioseparations, traditional chemistry is reaching its limits for large molecule applications, where biological specificity is needed and requires antibodies. In response, we recently launched our BioResolve Protein A affinity columns. BD's deep antibody library will accelerate our product road map, unlocking multiple projects with joint innovation that we could not advance alone and creating an estimated $35 million in new opportunities.\nIn diagnostics, upstream proteomics is identifying new biomarkers for early disease detection and residual disease monitoring as the field advances [indiscernible] is becoming an essential tool for multiplex diagnostics. This trend is validated by a leading diagnostics company integrating mass spec into its high-throughput platform. Through BD, we gained immediate access to a global network of specialty diagnostic labs, supported by a service infrastructure offering 24-hour premium plans. This channel and service capability alone supports a $40 million revenue opportunity for us.\nBeyond this, BD's strength in regulatory, assay development and automation provide a platform to scale and expand our mass spec diagnostics lending. None of this upside is reflected in our base case assumptions.\nFinally, cross-selling is another significant revenue opportunity. BD's strong presence in Pharma Clinical Labs gives Waters access to customers we have historically struggled to reach. This is especially relevant in DMPK, where our TQ Absolute mass spec platform outperforms competitors, but has lacked penetration due to limited channel access. We estimate this opportunity at $60 million in Pharma DMPK alone and have not counted cross-selling opportunities in other lab settings.\nFurther, our cross-selling assumptions do not include any contribution from mass spec for identification in microbiology labs or pharmas to reality testing in QA/QC applications, which are 2 areas I will cover in a moment. These revenue synergies, combined with the return of BD business to more normalized growth gives us a strong level of conviction in delivering on the financial plan presented at the announcement of the transaction with a 7% revenue CAGR and a mid-teens adjusted EPS growth CAGR between 2025 and 2030.\nNow I will cover the fit and quality of the microbiology business and the value creation upside opportunity that it holds. First, the quality of the assets we are bringing from BD into waters are exceptional, especially in flow cytometry and microbiology. BD is a pioneer in flow cytometry and has consistently driven innovation and enabled critical advances across oncology, rare disease and immune health. It has -- it has a well-adopted presence in midstream pharma settings such as clinical labs and is increasingly moving downstream into manufacturing. Considering our premier position in downstream, the logic for this part of the business is very apparent.\nWhat is less apparent at first glance, though is the incredible strategic fit of the microbiology business, which is equally as compelling and holds significant value creation opportunity. BD is a leader in microbiology with a legacy of first in infectious disease diagnostics and is an innovative provider of total workflow solutions for clinical labs. Approximately 2/3 of BD's $1.8 billion diagnostic solutions business comes from microbiology.\nIt benefits from consistent growth trends tied to infectious disease testing, anti-microbial resistance monitoring and increasing demand for lab automation. With its large installed base and strong brand recognition, we see a clear opportunity to enhance the performance of the microbiology business by uplifting its commercial execution and operational performance. This is particularly relevant because its revenue growth rate has trailed the competition by 180 basis points on a CAGR basis between 2019 and 2024, according to publicly available information.\nWe faced a similar situation at Waters 5 years ago. Through focused and disciplined execution, we have since delivered outperformance versus the industry. Now based on our extensive diligence, we are confident we can repeat the success here. And the timing of this opportunity is particularly relevant with the launch of the next-generation [indiscernible] system next year in 2026. Together with our execution, this will offer an added innovation catalyst for system replacements and microbiology labs.\nAt the same time, the microbiology business has a highly actionable 700 basis points gross margin expansion opportunity. This clearly this presents clear potential to add further value creation by applying Waters operational rigor and is not included in our underwriting model. Additionally, we see 2 potential growth vectors that are uniquely suited to Waters and microbiology that are not included in our revenue synergy assumptions.\nFirst is mass spec for microbial identification, which is an attractive $500 million TAM, growing high single digits that Waters does not serve today. By combining water strength in mass spec with BD's significant installed base and sales channel across over 10,000 clinical labs, we are well positioned to attach our mass specs to BD systems and enter this space. This is similar to how we have successfully attached our LCs to wires multi-angle light scattering detectors.\nSecond, microbiology is a critical QA/QC in pharmaceutical manufacturing for sterility testing, yet neither BD nor Waters currently serves this segment. BD has the right product portfolio but has lacked channel access or expertise in manufacturing environments. Waters brings long-standing relationships and credibility in these regulated settings. Together, we can unlock this untapped $300 million market, growing at a high single-digit rate and establish a strong presence in this attractive QA/QC segment.\nFinally, I will discuss integration. Over the last 5 years, we have assembled a leadership team with deep experience in transformation and large integrations. I am pleased to announce that Chris Ross, currently Senior Vice President of Global Operations at Waters, will lead the integration office of our combined -- of our combination with BD's Bioscience and Diagnostic Solutions business.\nChris brings extensive experience in large-scale integrations, having worked with me on the EMD Millipore Sigma Aldrich merger which was the largest merger in life science tools at the time and delivered record sales growth and margin development. His proven ability to unify teams, integrate complex organizations and deliver outstanding results makes him exceptionally well suited to lead this critical task.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to open the lines and take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Casper Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Leila, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Waters Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Dr. Udit Batra, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We will provide guidance regarding possible future results as well as commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. Please see the risk factors included within our Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide presentation accompanying today's call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nAnd good morning, everyone. We had a fantastic start to the year. Double-digit instrument growth drove our performance as customer spending, especially in pharma, exceeded expectations. Demand remained solid across all our end markets and geographies. These results are driven by our strong commercial execution and our steadfast commitment to operational excellence. I want to take a moment to thank all my colleagues for their dedication and outstanding performance. Their focus and agility enable us to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science and deliver solid financial outcomes, especially in dynamic market conditions.\nWe have consistently shown leadership through turbulent times. Just look at the last 5 years, where we have successfully navigated the pandemic, the global chip shortage, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. Through it all, Waters has become a stronger company by focusing on 3 guiding principles. First, we stay close to our customers and work tirelessly and with urgency to support their evolving needs as conditions shift. Second, while mitigating risks, we never lose sight of opportunities to enhance our competitive position, we remain focused on launching differentiated new products and investing in our capabilities.\nThird, we redouble support and communication with our colleagues who are dedicated to the mission of the company and lead with an indomitable spirit. String true to these principles has enabled us to consistently deliver robust results over the past 5 years. Today, we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment. However, our resilient downstream weighted revenue profile and swift operational actions position us to deliver high single-digit earnings growth this year, even after accounting for newly announced tariffs.\nAmol and I will discuss these points in greater detail later in the call. Turning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales grew 4% as reported and 7% in constant currency, landing at the high end of our guidance. Instruments grew 11%, led by mid-teens sales growth in both liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. With strength driven by pharma and industrial end markets. Recurring revenue increased mid-single digits, which is in line with our expectations for a quarter with 2 fewer days.\nIn China, sales grew 5%, led by double-digit growth in both industrial and academic and government applications. Earnings per share were also at the high end of guidance, supported by strong sales volume and an improvement in FX. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.25, reflecting low single-digit growth and high single-digit growth in constant currency terms.\nOn a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.03. Our 11% instrument growth was led by mid-teens growth in pharma. Additionally, order growth exceeded sales growth, highlighting continued momentum in our business. These results underscore our strong position in attractive secular markets particularly as customer CapEx spending has continued its recovery. As I highlight the drivers behind our strength, our message remains consistent. First, our team is executing well in an analytical instruments market still early in its recovery.\nSecond, our revitalized portfolio closely aligns with customer needs at a time when instruments are ripe for replacement. Our innovation remains highly differentiated in markets that we serve, commanding premium pricing. And thirdly, our leadership position in downstream high-volume applications enables us to capture growth across an exciting mix of fast-growing testing opportunities such as those of GLP-1, PFAS and genetic testing.\nInnovation played a key role this quarter, reflecting an excellent customer adoption of our new products. In liquid chromatography, sales of our Alliance IS HPLC system more than tripled year-over-year, driven by growth across replacement and greenfield opportunities. Within replacement, customers are upgrading to leverage its smart features, flexibility and productivity advantages. At the same time, adoption at new and expanding manufacturing facilities within pharma is particularly strong, notably among large U.S. CapEx investments.\nWe recently expanded the Alliance IS Bio HPLC product line by adding the photodiode array detector to enhance spectral insights for biopharma development and QC. Waters now has 4 configurations of Alliance IS HPLC platform to support routine quantitative analysis and expanded spectral analysis of small and large molecules in development and in QC.\nMass spectrometry growth was led by our Xevo TQ Absolute system, our top-selling mass spec again this quarter, achieving sales growth of over 50%. And Its superior sensitivity and sustainable design continue to drive demand, particularly in high-volume testing areas such as food and environmental analysis and pharma quantitation.\nIn our chemistry consumables business, MaxPeak Premier Columns again significantly exceeded expectations, growing more than 30%. These products provide excellent solutions for separating complex molecules such as biologics and novel therapeutic modalities. Our differentiated portfolio continues to command strong pricing. As we look ahead, this combination serves us well as a mechanism to provide offsets and capitalize on new demand opportunities in a dynamic global environment.\nOur unique exposure to emerging high-volume testing drivers also contributed meaningfully to our growth this quarter. For GLP-1 testing, we saw continued demand of our patrol UPLC system. This advanced analytical tool has become indispensable for in-process testing of these peptides during manufacturing. Additionally, our chemistry and HPLC offerings saw continued momentum in post fill finish quality testing, supported by solid CapEx investment and production volumes.\nWhile we have a leading position in the analytical testing of current GLP-1 injectables on the market today, we are also very well positioned for future oral introductions. PFAS-related testing sales grew over 90% in the first quarter, continuing the 40%-plus growth trend seen both in 2023 and 2024. LC-MS has become the dominant workhorse technique for regulated analysis of these compounds, including drinking water, soil and wastewater compliance monitoring. This is because most regulated compounds are polar and nonvolatile, making them best suited for liquid chromatography.\nWe expect emerging regulations governing PFAS to drive testing in areas like food packaging and consumer products, which is an attractive opportunity for Waters. Given the need to detect the same nonvolatile compounds, LC-MS is also the method of choice in these areas.\nOur India team again delivered revenue growth close to 20% in constant currency driven by strong demand from generics manufacturers and CDMOs. Looking ahead, as outlined at our recent Investor Day, we expect approximately 30 basis points of annual growth accretion from both GLP-1 and PFAS testing and an additional 70 to 100 basis points from growth in India. These volume growth drivers, combined with the instrument replacement cycle and our strong pricing performance present a compelling high single-digit plus growth profile for our company in the near to midterm.\nTurning now to new products. In the first quarter, we launched 2 new products in the TA division, the ElectroForce APeX-1 for precise mechanical testing of high-performance polymers and composites, and TGA smart seal bans, which support analysis of atmosphere sensitive materials in battery, polymer and drug development testing. Today, we also announced the launch of Empower for multi-angle light scattering detectors, which is an important milestone and commitment from our integration of wired. This advancement expands the scope of critical quality attributes that a biopharmaceutical laboratory can manage and submit to regulators using our Empower software.\nOur steady stream of innovation continues to strengthen our core business and support our expansion into higher growth adjacencies. I will now cover our updated 2025 full year guidance. Waters has a unique and resilient revenue profile anchored by our focused exposure to downstream high-volume applications. This includes pharma QA/QC where growth is closely tied to manufacturing output and CapEx spending trends. Within these segments, customer spending has remained robust. Looking ahead, customer manufacturing needs continue to evolve, with potential for additional investment driven by tariff-related capacity shifts and U.S. pharma reshoring initiatives.\nOur team continues to execute well with our revitalized portfolio, particularly as the instrument replacement cycle continues to ramp. We also expect sustained contribution from our idiosyncratic growth drivers and continued achievement of strong like-for-like pricing gains. Given our better-than-expected first quarter performance, we are raising our full year constant currency sales growth guidance to 5% to 7%, while adequately accounting for U.S. policy developments in the academic and government end market.\nOur adjustment to ANG growth expectation represents a 50 basis point impact on our full year growth outlook. But incremental price accretion from credit-related actions is separately expected to contribute an equivalent 50 basis point tailwind. As such, our growth assumptions for the rest of the year remain unchanged. We I will now talk about the current tariff situation and how Waters is positioned to meet the challenges from recent global trade policy changes.\nOur manufacturing footprint is highly globalized and it includes a strong existing U.S. presence. A significant portion of our ex U.S. manufacturing also takes place in jurisdictions subject only to the lower baseline tariff rate. We also do not have a significant tariff exposure to goods entering the U.S. from China or vice versa. After the tariffs were announced, we quickly stood up a cross-functional task force to assess tariff exposure and implement mitigation plans. We rapidly assess the impact of tariff exposure and implemented supply chain adjustments selective surcharges for tariffs and limits to discretionary spending.\nThanks to our swift and decisive actions, we are well positioned to limit the net impact of the newly announced tariffs to a modest $10 million on our 2025 adjusted operating margin, effectively offsetting the majority of a $45 million gross impact. Within our EPS, the combined resulting effect of tariffs and U.S. policy changes is fully offset by favorable foreign exchange movements. As a result, there is no net impact to our original earnings per share guidance.\nReflecting our first quarter outperformance, we are raising our full year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $12.75 to $13.05. This translates to approximately 8% to 10% EPS growth or 10% to 12% on a constant currency basis.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to cover our financial results in more detail and provide further details on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, we delivered sales of $662 million, up 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency, placing us at the high end of our guidance range.\nOrders growth exceeded sales growth, underscoring our strong momentum. By end market, Pharma grew 8%, industrial grew 6% and academic and government grew 3%. Pharma saw double-digit growth in Asia and the Americas and 3% growth in Europe. Industrial was led by Waters Division, which grew high single digits, driven by PFAS applications growing more than 90%. TA Instruments continued to benefit from battery testing demand. Within [indiscernible] government, as Udit highlighted, China grew double digits as we continue to leverage our local market presence.\nRegionally, Asia grew 13% with China growing 5%, Americas grew 6% and Europe grew low single digits. By product line, instrument sales grew 11%, driven by mid-teens growth in both liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Recurring revenues grew mid-single digits as expected, given the 2 fewer days in the quarter.\nCustomer activity remains strong and installed base utilization remains high with our consistent results supported by our commercial initiatives in service plan attachment, e-commerce adoption and the launch of new bioseparations columns.\nOverall, the first quarter execution was strong across markets, regions and product lines and our resilient growth exposure positions us well for the remainder of the year. Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance. Earnings per share reached $2.25 coming in at high end of guidance, supported by robust sales volume and an improvement in FX rates. This represents 2% reported growth and 7% growth in constant currency.\nGAAP earnings per share were $2.03. Gross margin came in at 58.2% and adjusted operating margin came in at 25.5%, consistent with our expectations. Our operating tax rate for the quarter was 16% and our average diluted share count was 59.7 million shares.\nTurning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. First quarter free cash flow was $234 million after funding $26 million of capital expenditures. This represents 35% of first quarter sales and a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 174%.\nOur strong free cash flow generation allowed us to rapidly delever our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $170 million. Our net debt position is now approximately $1.1 billion, returning to pre-wired acquisition levels. This results in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1x. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to actively evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nAdditionally, we will assess the potential resumption of our share repurchase program during the course of 2025. Now I will share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance. Waters has a unique and resilient revenue profile anchored by our focused exposure to downstream high-volume applications. Within these segments, the recovery in customer CapEx spending has remained robust. Additionally, customer manufacturing needs continue to evolve, with potential for additional investments in new capacity driven by tariff-related capacity shifts and U.S. pharma reshoring initiatives, which is not included in our guidance.\nWe continue to execute well with our revitalized portfolio, particularly as instrument replacement gains further momentum. We also expect to sustain contributions from our idiosyncratic growth drivers and strong like-for-like pricing gains. We are raising our full year constant currency sales growth guidance to 5% to 7%, reflecting our better-than-expected first quarter performance, while adequately accounting for the recent U.S. policy developments in the academic and government end market. U.S. A&G customers account for approximately 3% of our total revenue making it a relatively modest part of our business.\nAs part of our disciplined approach to forecasting, we have proactively adjusted our outlook for this segment by $15 million to reflect recent market developments. While this adjustment represents 50 basis points to our full year growth outlook, incremental pricing accretion from tariff-related actions are separately expected to contribute 50 basis points of tailwind. As a result, our growth assumption for the remainder of the year remains unchanged. We are also raising our reported sales growth guidance to a range of 4% to 6%, reflecting our strong momentum in the first quarter plus recent tailwinds from FX rate assumptions.\nTurning now to the current impact of tariffs. As Udit outlined, we have acted swiftly to limit the net impact of the announced tariffs to a modest $10 million on our adjusted operating margin for 2025. Approximately 80% of our gross $45 million exposure relates to finished products manufactured in U.K., Singapore and Ireland for U.S. operations as well as raw materials imported to support U.S. manufacturing.\nThe remaining 20% is tied to the trade between the U.S. and China. Approximately $8 million of our net exposure and $39 million of our gross exposure relates to the second half of 2025. To respond quickly and decisively, we established a cross-functional task force that immediately mobilized to assess risk, implement mitigation strategies and safeguard our financial objectives. Thanks to the team's rapid actions, including targeted supply chain adjustments, selective surcharges, and disciplined discretionary spend management, we have substantially mitigated this impact.\nWhile incremental pricing actions related to tariffs help preserve profit, their impact on the reported margin percentage differs. Accounting for the modest net impact of tariffs, together with the incremental favorable benefit of foreign exchange rates, we now expect our full year 2025 gross margin to be approximately 59% and our adjusted operating margin to be approximately 31%.\nIn both cases, this reflects a margin percentage that is roughly in line with our 2024 levels. Below the line, we now expect full year net interest expense to be approximately $40 million, reflecting better-than-expected debt pay down in the first quarter. Our guidance assumes average diluted share count remains at approximately 59.7 million shares. We continue to anticipate full year tax rate of around 16.5%, in line with last year.\nConsequently, we are raising our full year 2025 EPS guidance to account for better-than-expected first quarter performance, while absorbing the full impact of tariffs and U.S. policy changes without any degradation to our prior earnings expectations. We now expect full year 2025 adjusted earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $12.75 to $13.05 inclusive of all tariff impacts. This is approximately 8% to 10% growth and to 12% on a constant currency basis.\nOur guidance accounts for announced tariffs that currently enacted and those scheduled for after the 90-day pause. Turning [indiscernible] for the second quarter of 2025, we expect constant currency sales growth of 5% to 7%. Net of currency translation, reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 4% to 6%. For EPS, we anticipate our second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $2.88 and $2.98. This represents approximately 10% to 13% reported EPS growth or 12% to 15% growth on a constant currency basis.\nWith that, I will hand the call back to Udit for closing comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, our first quarter results reflect excellent momentum and reinforce our confidence in both the recovery of the instrument market and the steady growth of our recurring revenues. We are executing from a position of strength, anchored by resilient sources of growth and a revitalized portfolio that continues to command strong pricing.\nWe remain firmly on track to achieve our 2025 objectives despite the currently the recently announced tariffs and no expected impact to our original EPS expectations for the year. Our commitment to operational excellence, financial discipline and rapid execution continues to deliver solid outcomes and creates value for our shareholders. We are energized by our progress, confident in our positioning and immensely proud of our team who have been instrumental in achieving these strong outcomes.\nSo with that, I will turn the call back to Casper.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to open the lines and take your questions."

Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We will provide guidance regarding possible future results as well as commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the first quarter of 2025 and full year 2025.

Over to you, Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered an excellent finish to 2024 in the fourth quarter, achieving high single-digit constant currency revenue growth and low teens adjusted EPS growth. In Pharma, which is our largest end market, sales grew low double digits.\nBefore diving into the details, I want to thank my colleagues at Waters for their resilience, innovative spirit and collaboration. This fuels our strong sales performance and operational achievements as we accelerate the benefits of pioneering science.\nThroughout the year, our message has remained clear and consistent. We are executing well in an analytical instruments and systems market that is beginning its recovery. The innovation in our revitalized portfolio is well aligned with customer unmet needs at a time when instruments are ripe for replacement. Our focus and leadership position in downstream, high-volume life science applications has earned us a unique exposure to an exciting mix of fast-growing high-volume testing opportunities. This includes GLP-1 testing, PFAS testing and the generics market in India.\nToday, I'm pleased to share the latest proof points that demonstrate our favorable position, right at a time when a recovery in customer CapEx spending and instrument replacement is beginning to kick into gear. I expect the strength and momentum to continue into 2025, and we will cover this later in the call.\nTurning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales grew 6.4% as reported and 8% in constant currency. Sales exceeded the high end of our guidance range as growth accelerated across all our 3 reported regions. Instruments grew 8%, outpacing our expectations, as LC Mass Spec light scattering and TA system sales each grew high single digits or better.\nRecurring revenues grew 9%, also marking an improvement from the previous quarter, with chemistry and service both up high single digits. We continue to build momentum, delivering a high teens quarter-over-quarter revenue ramp, while funnel activity remains strong.\nWe also achieved outstanding results within our P&L with our sustained focus on operational excellence, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.10, reflecting 13% EPS growth. Excluding the impact of FX, our adjusted EPS grew 22%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.88.\nTurning now to the full year. Sales were flat as reported and in organic constant currency as our quarterly growth performance improved every quarter. Recurring revenue grew 6%, once again, underscoring the unique resilience of our recurring portfolio across various market conditions.\nWith a strong EPS result in Q4, our full year non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $11.86. This reflects 1% growth and includes a 5% decline due to foreign exchange headwinds. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.71 per share.\nBreaking out our results in more detail. We saw strong broad-based growth in the fourth quarter. Strength was led by our Pharma and Academic end markets, both of which grew double digits.\nIn Pharma, sales grew 10%, led by low double-digit growth in Europe and Asia and high single-digit growth in the Americas. In particular, spending amongst large pharma, contract manufacturing organizations, and generics customers continued to recover, where our revenue is tied to high-volume regulated QA/QC applications.\nIn our non-pharma segment, sales grew 6%, led by low double-digit growth in Europe, mid-single-digit growth in Asia and low single-digit growth in the Americas. We saw strong growth in the A&G segment across Asia, including China, Japan and India as well as in Europe.\nBy geography, Europe grew 11%; Asia, 9%; America, 6%. In China, overall sales returned to positive growth in China, and was up low single digits. Although -- altogether, these results reflect excellent momentum into the year-end.\nI would now like to share more in-depth commentary on what drove our strong performance. With our commercial focus and disciplined execution, we continue to deliver impressive outcomes, driving like-for-like pricing gains. We also capitalized on the success of our new product launches, achieved strong placement of our new flagship products that command a price premium due to their unmatched benefits in solving customer unmet needs.\nWithin LC, Alliance iS has paved the way for smarter, more capable liquid chromatography separation that minimizes user errors. In the fourth quarter, sales more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Alliance iS constituted 20% of our HPLC revenue in the fourth quarter after adoption continued to scale throughout the year.\nWithin Mass Spec, the Xevo TQ Absolute system remained our best-selling mass spectrometer with its market-leading sensitivity and sustainable design. In the fourth quarter, unit sales grew 40% year-over-year and constituted 50% of our Tandem Quad revenue. As a reminder, Tandem Quads are the most suitable mass specs for high-volume, quantitative measurements in compliant settings. The Xevo TQ Absolute has been a key driver of the strong results we've achieved in PFAS testing and in clinical applications.\nOur PFAS revenue grew over 40% in the fourth quarter and for the year. PFAS testing is a 400 million global market, growing at 20% annually. So this represents growth at approximately twice the market for the second consecutive year.\nFor clinical, total clinical revenue grew low teens in the quarter, driven in part by strong sales of the IVD version of the Xevo TQ Absolute.\nWithin our chemistry consumables business, our newer column launches aimed at separating larger, more complex molecules, like biologics and novel modalities, continue to perform ahead of expectations. Max Premier columns sales grew over 30% in the quarter and over 40% for the year. With success of our new column launches, our exposure to higher-growth, large molecule applications has risen. Large molecule applications are now approximately 40% of our pharma chemistry revenue and growing.\nOur service team has continued to make strides in increasing plan attachment. For the first time, over 50% of our active installed base has a service plan in place. [ STI ] recently recognized our service team for delivering the highest service satisfaction scores among all instrument vendors. At the same time, our Net Promoter Scores lead the industry according to technology and services industry associations.\nDuring the quarter, our unique exposure to new, high-volume testing drivers also contributed to our growth. This includes novel therapeutic areas such as GLP-1 testing, PFAS testing applications in food and environmental testing and the expanding generic drug market -- generic stock market in India. All 3 represent a compelling growth opportunity for Waters based on our leadership position in downstream, high-volume life science applications.\nIn 2024, we performed very well against our growth expectations in each of these areas. In the near to midterm, we continue to expect 30 basis points annual average growth accretion from both GLP-1 testing and PFAS testing, while India is expected to add 70 to 100 basis points to the growth.\nNow I will talk more about our operational performance. Our team faced numerous margin challenges throughout the year, including FX, inflation and the normalization of annual incentive compensation. Despite a rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter, our unwavering focus on operational excellence allowed us to counteract the currency headwinds. We achieved a 60 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin to 35.5% after absorbing 220 basis points of FX impact.\nOffsetting currency and macroeconomic headwinds is something our team has gotten very good at. For the full year, we achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion, closing the year at 31%. This is after absorbing 130 basis points of FX-related impact.\nAs we look ahead, while no 2 macroeconomic environments are the same, instrument down cycles have historically been followed by an up cycle as a new instrument replacement cycle emerges. During these uptrends, instrument growth has typically been 2% to 3% higher than the long-term average of 5%.\nCurrently, our instrument growth sits at 2% on a 5-year CAGR basis versus 2019. This comes after weak macroeconomic conditions put temporary constraints on customer CapEx spending for downstream instrumentation in recent years. The growth catch-up opportunity from this deferred instrument replacement is beginning to kick in to gear.\nMeanwhile, in the longer term, we expect the average growth rate of instruments to actually trend higher than the historical 5%, driven by higher volume trends, new application areas like large molecules and better pricing dynamics.\nTogether, with the progress we have made in our high-growth adjacencies, Waters is well positioned for an exciting new era of growth as the analytical instrument market continues to recover. This also coincides with the launch of a new wave of commercial and value creation initiatives that we look forward to discussing in detail at our upcoming Investor Day.\nI will now cover the 2025 full year guidance. Customer spending has shown steady signs of recovery in analytical instruments, particularly in the downstream, high-volume settings that we serve. We expect these positive trends to continue into 2025.\nOur team continues to execute well with our revitalized portfolio at a time when instrument replacement is beginning to pick up. Together, our resilient recurring revenue growth and the ongoing impact of our idiosyncratic growth drivers, we anticipate continuing our strong momentum into 2025. These dynamics support full year 2025 constant currency sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 7%.\nWithin the P&L, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar introduced additional foreign exchange headwinds. Nevertheless, we plan to counterbalance these impacts with robust operational performance, sustaining our margin expansion trends into 2025. This translates to a full year 2025 earnings per fully diluted share guidance of $12.70 to $13. On a non-GAAP basis, this is a 7% to 10% growth versus our 2024 -- versus 2024, and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 4% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to cover our financial results in more detail and provide further details on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a strong finish to the year. Sales of $873 million grew 6% as reported and 8% in constant currency as both instruments and recurring revenues grew high single digits.\nWith our strong commercial execution and new product portfolio, we benefited from budget flush as overall sales ramped up $132 million or 18% quarter-over-quarter. This was meaningfully higher than the mid-teens ramp assumption in our guidance.\nIn constant currency terms, by end market, Pharma grew 10%, Industrial grew 2% and Academic and Government grew 16%. In Pharma, sales grew 12% in Asia, 10% in Europe and 9% in Americas.\nInstrument sales grew high single digits, led by liquid chromatography as deferred customer spending continued its early stages of recovery.\nIn Industrial, growth was led by our TA division, which also grew high single digits amidst strength in batteries, advanced materials and chemical testing.\nWithin our Waters division, we continue to see strong growth in PFAS-related applications, which grew over 40% in the quarter.\nIn Academic and Government, the strong performance was driven by 35% growth in Asia and 20% growth in Europe. Within Asia, growth was broad-based.\nBy geography, each of our 3 reported regions saw significant growth acceleration versus the prior quarter. Europe grew 11%, Asia grew 9% and Americas grew 6%, each with broad strength across our end markets. In China, sales returned to growth, up low single digits.\nBy products and services, Instruments grew 8%, reflecting broad strength across our instrument portfolio, including LC, Mass Spec, light scattering and TA. In recurring revenue, chemistry grew 7% and service grew 9%, as customer activity remained strong, with high utilization of our installed base. Our robust growth has been supported by our commercial initiatives in areas such as service plan attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch of our new bioseparation columns.\nTurning now to full year results. Sales of $2.96 billion were flat as reported and flat in organic constant currency terms. By end market, Pharma grew 1%, Industrial was flat and Academic and Government declined 7%.\nBy geography, Europe grew 2%, while Americas and Asia both declined 1%. Asia ex China grew high single digits, while China declined low double digits as expected.\nBy products and services, instrument growth rates recovered throughout the year and declined 7% overall. Recurring revenues grew 6%, reflecting the resilience of our chemistry consumables and service businesses.\nNow I will comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. During the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly. With our focus on operational excellence, including pricing, productivity and cost management, we were able to offset the impact.\nGross margin was 60.1% for the quarter and 59.4% for the full year. Excluding FX, gross margin expanded 60 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively.\nFor the quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 35.5%. For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded to 31% after absorbing 130 basis points of adverse FX impact as well as the normalization of annual incentive compensation. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to continue our margin expansion journey through our productivity initiatives and take our profitability to new heights.\nTogether with better-than-expected sales volume, our strong operational performance drove 13% growth in non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to $4.10. This landed at the high end of our guidance range even with an FX headwind that was $0.23 greater than anticipated. On GAAP basis, EPS was $3.88. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS grew 1% to $11.86. This includes a decline of approximately 5% due to foreign exchange headwinds. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.71.\nOur effective adjusted operating tax rate was 16.9% for the quarter and 16.4% for the full year. Our average share count was 59.6 million for the quarter and for the full year.\nTurning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $188 million after funding $52 million of capital expenditures, including the purchase of $13 million manufacturing facility in Colorado. For the full year, free cash flow was $744 million or 25% of sales, resulting in a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 105%.\nWith the strong free cash flow generation in our business model, we've made solid progress delivering our balance sheet, and our net debt position is now approaching [ pre-wired ] acquisition levels. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $200 million, resulting in approximately $900 million of debt repayments made in 2024. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.3 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.3x.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders. We'll also evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program during the course of 2025.\nNow I would like to share further commentary on our 2025 outlook. Customer spending has shown steady signs of recovery in analytical instruments, particularly in downstream, high volume settings that we serve. We expect these positive trends to continue into 2025.\nOur team is executing very well with our revitalized portfolio. Together with our resilient recurring revenue growth and supported by our ongoing impact of our idiosyncratic growth drivers, we anticipate achieving strong results again in 2025. These dynamics support full year 2025 constant currency sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 7%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of 2% on full year sales. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 2.5% to 5%.\nWithin the P&L, we plan to counterbalance the impact of foreign exchange headwinds through continued robust operational performance, sustaining our strong margin performance into 2025. We expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.6% and an adjusted operating margin of 31.2% for the full year. In both cases, this represents 20 basis points of net year-over-year expansion, net of 40 basis points of FX headwind.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $46 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be largely consistent with 2024 levels at 16.5% as we anticipate mitigating the incremental effects of [ Pillar 2 ], including those relating to Singapore. Our average diluted share count is expected to be approximately 59.3 million.\nRolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2025 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $12.70 to $13, which is approximately 7% to 10% growth, and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 4% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.\nLooking to the first quarter of 2025, our constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of 4% to 7%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3%. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1% to 7% -- 1% to 4%.\nThe first quarter of 2025 has 2 fewer days than the first quarter of 2024. At the same time, the fourth quarter of 2024 had 2 additional days than the fourth quarter of 2023. Based on these dynamics, together with our 4% to 7% constant currency sales growth guidance and an expected 7 percentage points of currency headwind on earnings, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is estimated to be in the range of $2.17 to $2.25.\nNow I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. 2024 was a defining year for Waters. We delivered excellent sales and operational performance, capitalized on the momentum of our new product launches and saw a strong contribution from our idiosyncratic growth drivers. We also made continued progress in our high-growth adjacencies.\nAs we look to 2025, there is a lot to be excited about. We're coming out of the gate stronger than ever in market conditions that are beginning to recover. We are confident in our ability to deliver enhanced value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. Danny, we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We will provide guidance regarding possible future results as well as commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2024 and full year 2024.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. Please see the risk factors included within our Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide presentation accompanying today's call.\nBoth are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are on a comparable organic constant currency basis.\nFinally, we do not intend to update our guidance predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now I'll hand over to Udit to deliver our key remarks. Following that, Amol will present a more detailed view of our results and guidance after we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Over to you, Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We achieved strong results in the second quarter that exceeded both our top line and bottom line reported guidance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their dedication to commercial execution, operational management and innovation. This enables us to deliver differentiated performance and accelerate the benefits of pioneering science. In the quarter, year-over-year organic constant currency sales were 500 basis points better than Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with a strong finish in June. Orders outpaced sales for the quarter as we built good momentum for the second half of the year. We again delivered resilient operational results with earnings surpassing our expectations. This reflects the strength of our downstream business model, progress on our strategic and operational initiatives and our indomitable spirit. We also continued our steady stream of new product launches, releasing further innovations that address key customer needs.\nWaters now has a highly competitive portfolio serving attractive end markets. We expect this benefit -- we expect this to benefit us as the market recovers and the instrument replacement cycle picks up pace. As we continue to build the Waters of the future, I would like to welcome Rob Carpio, who has joined us as the new Head of the Waters Division. Rob is a talented leader and a seasoned operator with a record of delivering strong financial results and transformation in life sciences. With his appointment, he will comment a long-term growth strategy. Turning now to our results. In the second quarter, sales declined 4% as reported and 4% in organic constant currency.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.40. Excluding China, sales declined in low single digits. Growth was consistent with our expectations across each of our end markets. Customer CapEx spending is showing early signs of improvement. In China, sales declined in the low teens, which was better than expected. Growth rates improved in all end markets compared to the previous quarter, especially in pharma and in industrial. While the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government this year are still in the early stages of implementation. We are having active conversations with customers who stand to benefit from these initiatives.\nSo far, this has led to improved quoting and funnel trends in the region. These opportunities are expected to begin converting to orders in 2025. Overall, instruments declined 17% and recurring revenue grew 5% -- delivered a 2% M&A contribution to sales, which was better than expected. It marks a strong close to the first year following the acquisition, where synergies were delivered well ahead of schedule. Why it operates in high-growth markets serving large molecule applications, especially across cell, gene and RNA therapies. Altogether, it should deliver 40 basis points of annualized accretion to the total company growth in the near to midterm.\nNow I will talk about our operational performance. Margins remained resilient as we again successfully counteracted volume, FX and inflationary headwinds with solid operational management. Our gross margin for the quarter was flat at 59.3%, and our adjusted operating margin was solid at 29.2%. Even with recent progress, our work is far from over. We have runway towards further long-term margin expansion driven by our strategic and operational initiatives. This includes areas such as productivity enhancement where we have various programs that are still in the early stages.\nAt the same time, our focus on pricing continues to yield contribution that is well ahead of historical levels. Looking forward, we feel very good about our future margin opportunity given our recent success in preserving and expanding our margins during challenging business conditions. Beyond 2024 levels, we expect to deliver a more pronounced impact on our long-term margin performance, particularly when more typical volume leverage returns. In the second quarter, we launched a steady stream of new products, solving the unmet needs of our customers. At ASMS in June, we unveiled the Xevo MRD, which is now our highest performing bench top mass spectrometer.\nIt builds on the multi reflecting time-of-flight technology pioneered by the Select Series MRT, which has greater throughput and a more compact form factor. With up to 6x greater resolution and 2x better mass accuracy than competitive systems, the Xevo MRT sets new industry standards for high resolution at blazingly fast speeds. So far, our customers have been impressed by its capabilities. It will serve discovery and other upstream pharma workflows where it will accelerate R&D times for new drugs.\nThis includes areas such as metabolite identification where resolution, accuracy and speed are all critical value drivers. We also launched the latest evolution of our acuity QDa mass detector, 1 of our all-time best-selling analytical instruments. The QDa 2 provides a 20% enhancement in mass range which benefits routine identification and analysis of large molecules. It also has excellent green credentials consuming up to 70% less energy than competing products. This is a benefit of increased importance to our customers.\nMost importantly, the QDA 2 runs on Empower, which allows for seamless regulatory submission of compliance-related data for large molecules. As we look ahead, Waters is well positioned in attractive markets with secular growth drivers where testing volume plays a pivotal role in driving long-term growth. Our full ecosystem of instruments, informatics, advanced chemistry and leading service positions us very well to help ensure the safety of medicine, food and water and batteries in electric vehicles. Along with our business model, the regulated and recurring nature of these applications results in excellent profitability and free cash flow generation.\nIn recent years, we've made meaningful progress in aligning Waters with faster-growing large molecule applications. Now over 1/3 of our pharma revenues comes from large molecules and novel modalities. At the same time, future testing volume is expected to grow faster than historical levels with increased prescription volumes, including GLP-1s and areas such as PFAS testing. With our revitalized portfolio, we are in an excellent position to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Over the past several years, we've launched multiple innovative new products that have enhanced our competitive edge and created better pricing levers.\nServing our core -- our next-generation LC platform, Alliance IS serves routine QAQC analysis for both large and small molecule workflows where innovation helps drive -- helps to drive instrument replacement. It also includes our Xevo TQ absolute mass spectrometer, which is seeing rapid growth in areas such as PFAS testing. Within our high-growth adjacencies, we've launched new products into bioanalytical characterization, battery testing and clinical applications, all of which are gaining traction given the critical unmet needs that they solve. Finally, recent deferral of routine instrument replacement has created a catch-up opportunities -- catch-up opportunity that lies ahead of us. Weak macroeconomic conditions have put temporary constraints on customer CapEx spending for downstream instrumentation.\nHistorically, this dynamic has lasted for 4 to 7 quarters and has been followed by a catch up. Looking at the facts, while no 2 macro environments are the same, Q2 marks the seventh consecutive quarter of LC instrument decline. Expected instrument growth for 2024 equates to a 1% CAGR versus 2019 levels. This is significantly below the 5% long-term average growth rate. Improving funnel trends are a positive leading indicator that we are approaching the early innings of a recovery and initiation of a new replacement cycle.\nI will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. While customer activity is showing signs of recovery, we're adding caution to our guide. Accordingly, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. As a result, our revised full year organic growth constant currency sales guidance is negative 2% to negative 0.5%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L and deliver an adjusted operating margin of around 31%. Therefore, our updated adjusted EPS guidance is in the range of $11.55 to $11.65. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and to provide further guidance -- further details on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales exceeded our guidance range on a reported basis, declining 4%. Organic constant currency sales also declined 4%, which was a 5% improvement in growth compared with Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with orders outpacing sales. M&A contributed 2% to sales covering -- results in the first 1.5 months of the quarter. This was better than expected as we were able to accelerate revenue synergies as part of our integration. We are pleased that within the first year of the acquisition -- it is already EPS and margin accretive and our M&A execution remains well on track.\nOverall, FX was a 2% headwind to the second quarter sales. In organic constant currency terms, by end market, pharma declined 4%, Industrial declined 4% and academic and government declined 16%. In Pharma, sales excluding China declined low single digits, while in China, sales declined low double digits. In both cases, this reflects an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. In Industrial, sales declined 1% outside of China, led by low single-digit growth in the Americas. We again saw strong growth globally for PFAS-related applications, which has been a consistent tailwind for environmental testing.\nIn China, sales declined low double digits, which was also an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. For our TA division, sales were flat, driven by improvement in segments such as electronics, advanced materials and chemicals. In academic and government, growth remained weak as stimulus in China and elevated global funding drove lumpy spending patterns and a tough 21% comparison in the prior year's quarter. By geography, sales in Asia declined 3%, while sales in Americas and Europe both declined 7%.\nBy products and services, instruments declined 17% and chemistry and service both grew 5%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter. Our commercial initiatives continue to support robust recurring revenue growth despite ongoing headwinds from China. Within our service business, we have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points this year with service planned revenue growing high single digits in the quarter.\nWe are now targeting an additional 50 to 100 basis points of service plan attachment over the remainder of the year. Now I will comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volume, FX and inflation. Our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and prudent spend management allowed us to deliver a resilient margin performance in the quarter. Gross margin was flat at 59.3% and our second quarter adjusted operating margin was 29.2% as expected.\nExcluding FX, both gross margin and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 16.5%, and our average share count was 59.5 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share was $2.40. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $143 million after funding $36 million of capital expenditures. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $377 million or 28% of sales resulting in free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 131%. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, we continued to delever while paying out this year's tax reform payment of $96 million and other items totaling $30 million. As expected, at the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.7 billion which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.7x. As we continue to delever our balance sheet, we will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year.\nNow I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our guidance for the third quarter. While business conditions showed signs of recovery in the second quarter, we are adding caution to our guidance. As a result, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. Our updated guidance assumes relatively flat quarter-over-quarter revenue progression in Q3 versus Q2. It also implies a weaker than typical budget flush dynamics in the fourth quarter.\nDespite the added caution, we are still expecting the business to return to growth in the second half of the year. Given these dynamics, our revised full year 2024 guidance, is for organic constant currency sales growth between negative 2% and negative 0.5%. At current exchange rates, we anticipate that currency translation will negatively impact full year sales by approximately 1.5%. Meanwhile, M&A contribution from wire transaction has added 1.3% to our full year from inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year.\nTherefore, our total full year 2024 reported sales growth guidance is in the range of negative 2.2% to negative 0.7%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L, even with the reduction in our guide. Consistent with our previous guidance, gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 59.8%, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 31%. Below the line, we expect full year net interest expense to be approximately $77 million.\nOur full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3% and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.4 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year revised 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.55 to $11.65 and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 3% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate that customer spending will remain cautious, but show further signs of recovery.\nWe expect an improvement in year-over-year growth compared to that in the second quarter as previous year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier and has continued improvement in funnel activity translates to orders. Given these dynamics, our third quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of positive 1% to positive 3%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%. Therefore, our third quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%.\nBased on these revenue expectations, third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 2 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So now to summarize, with our strong commercial execution and continued resilient operational performance, our second quarter results demonstrate Waters' ability to deliver solid results in various market conditions. We're positioned well for the future with a long-term outlook that is above our historical growth rate of 6% as global testing volume growth remains on track and customer CapEx spending continues to recover. I am also proud of what our team has continued to accomplish on ESG and sustainability. Last month, we announced that Waters has become the first liquid chromatography column provider to receive the ACT Ecolabel certification from My Green Lab. This designation applies to more than 40 of our LC columns and makes it easier for scientists and procurement professionals to choose more sustainable lab products. So with that, I will now turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. And that concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would like to first point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.\nIn particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 in organic constant currency terms. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance, predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year with sales coming in at the high end of our expectations backed again by excellent operational performance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their continued focus on innovation and supporting our customers. These results reflect our drive to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science with our innovative portfolio. In the first quarter, market conditions were as expected, with cautious customer spending and later than typical budget releases. But as budgets opened up, we executed well with sales landing at the high end of our guide. We also continued to deliver outstanding operational results. Earnings were above our guidance and margins expanded even with volume and FX headwinds. This is a testament to our team, our resilient business model and our operational initiatives. Waters is well positioned for future growth in our attractive secular end markets. In the first quarter, we added to our revitalized portfolio with new products that serve high-growth areas.\nTurning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance at $2.21. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.72. Outside of China, sales declined mid-single digits as expected. In China, sales declined just under 30%, which was better than expected. Growth remained weak as our prior year baseline does not reflect last year's deterioration in market conditions, which became more pronounced in the second half.\nWhile instruments declined 25% overall, LC sales were slightly better than expected, instrument weakness was led by mass spec, particularly for A&G-related applications, which had a tough prior year comparison from global funding and the China stimulus -- delivered a 3% M&A contribution to sales. We continue to see strong synergy performance and traction for our recently launched products such as Zatar. Now I will talk more about our operational performance. We believe the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management, particularly when things slow down.\nwhile facing significant headwinds from volume, FX and inflation, we delivered yet another strong margin result. Our gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 58.9%, and our operating margin expanded 20 basis points for the quarter to 27%. This was achieved through a combination of our operational management initiatives across pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment. These initiatives position us well for resilience during lower volume periods and give longer-term opportunity when market conditions normalize. You can see further evidence of our operational performance and our free cash flow. We had an exceptional start to the year, generating free cash flow of USD 234 million in the first quarter, which was 37% of sales.\nWith our excellent free cash flow profile, we made rapid progress in delevering from the Viet acquisition, as we approach its 1-year anniversary. We serve attractive secular end markets where testing volume plays a pivotal role in our business. This volume, which is correlated with global prescription consumption is expected to accelerate in the future, supporting our strong long-term growth outlook. Our distinct advantage in downstream applications lines with our full ecosystem of products that complement our innovative instrument portfolio.\nIn addition, we have strategically aligned with high-growth opportunities that further enhance our core position. We had a busy quarter launching several new products that support a number of exciting, high-growth areas. At Analytica, last month, we launched the Alliance IS Bio, a version of our groundbreaking next-generation liquid chromatography platform suited for biologics applications. In the -- the new HPLC system combines advanced bioseparation technology, bioinert surfaces and built-in intelligence features. This helps Biopharma QC analysts boost efficiency and eliminate up to 40% -- lab errors. We believe that the Alliance is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in over a decade.\nWe're excited to bring this technology to routine testing applications for biologics. Supporting BioSeparations, we launched a new set of size exclusion chromatography columns called GPX Resolve Premier. These columns enable scientists to quickly assess aggregate content, integrity and purity of larger biologic particles. It covers modalities such as lipid nanoparticles -- acids, and viral vectors and give scientists a significant improvement in sensitivity and sample consumption while accelerating run times. This launch supports the development of these modalities into downstream high-volume settings, where Waters has critical instrument technology like LC, mass spec and light scattering as well as highly innovative industry-leading software chemistry and service.\nTo simplify the detection of PFAS, we launched Waters, oasis, dual-phase analysis cartridges. This consumable streamline sample prep for PFAS workflows when detecting concentrations in water, soils, biosolids and issues. It joins our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that support the surging demand for PFAS testing, which is a USD 300 million to USD 350 million global market, growing 20% annually. In an environment of increased scrutiny, the ability to accurately test for PFAS at very low levels is becoming a critical compliance need for a broad spectrum of industries.\nOur Xevo TQ absolute mass spec has leading sensitivity for detecting these anionic compounds. It can detect BFAST levels at as low as 1 part per quadrillion. Last month, in the United States, the EPA finalized and enforceable 4 parts per trillion limit of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, which marks a significant regulatory milestone. Later this year, further regulations governing PFAS are expected across the globe. This includes the European Union, where each proposed chemicals, regulation contemplates a PFAS ban on products manufactured as well as once imported.\nIn our TA business, we launched the RIO IS, which serves battery testing applications when used with our Hybrid Rheometers. This -- spectroscopy accessory supports characterization of electrode studies, which can lead to more efficient factory reduction. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. With our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our full year revenue outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance at negative 0.5% to positive 1.5% growth in organic constant currency.\nWe expect growth rates to improve over the remainder of the year and as our prior year comparisons, especially in China get easier. We expect improving funnel activity to translate to orders as the year progresses. With our strong operational performance, we expect to build leverage and P&L despite the flattish revenue guide and delivered 20 to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth. As a result, our adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at 0% to 3% growth in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and provide the rest of our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance range, declining 7% -- and 9% in organic constant currency. As Udit mentioned, end market dynamics were consistent with our expectations. Ex-China declined mid-single digits as expected, while China declined close to 30%, which was slightly better than expected. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 6%, industrial declined 7% and academic and government declined 30%.\nIn Pharma, sales outside of China declined low single digits as we executed well in this CapEx constrained environment. In China, sales declined almost 30% due to ongoing market challenges that are not reflected in our prior year baselines. In industrial, food and environmental applications grew mid-single digits with continued strong growth in -- globally. We also saw strong growth in battery testing within our TA business, which has been a consistent growth theme.\nHowever, this strength was more than offset by weakness in core industrial applications, which are more cyclical. Our TA business declined high single digits overall, while chemical analysis declined high teens. In academic and government, growth was weak against a 45% comparison as stimulus in China and elevated global funding in the prior year quarter drove lumpy spending patterns. By geography, sales in Asia declined 16%. The Americas declined 8% and Europe declined 3%. By products and services, instruments declined 25% with LC growth slightly better than expected.\nWithin recurring revenues, chemistry grew low single digits and service grew mid-single digits, both of which were affected by low activity levels in China. The quarter had 1 fewer day versus first quarter of 2023, which translates to a growth headwind of approximately 1% for recurring revenues. Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment.\nOur focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment allowed us to deliver first quarter gross margin of 58.9%, an expansion of 40 basis points and first quarter adjusted operating margin of 27% and expansion of 20 basis points. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and our average share count was 59.4 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were $1.72. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $234 million after funding $29 million of capital expenditures, which is approximately 37% of sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8x.\nThis reflects a decrease of approximately $300 million, as we delivered the wire acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt in -- part of the wires acquisition last year. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objectives. Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance. We expect to see an improvement in sales growth over the course of 2024 as prior year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier, and has improved funnel activity translates to orders.\nOur full year guidance is unchanged with 2024 organic constant currency sales growth expected between negative 0.5% and positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on a full year sales basis. We expect wire transaction to add just over 1% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenue for inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is unchanged at approximately 0% to 2%.\nDespite guiding to flattish sales, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is a 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately [ 59.7 ] million.\nRolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is also unchanged and projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. This is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the second quarter 2024, we anticipate that cautious customer spending will persist. In addition, while the China Q2 baseline reflects the onset of weakness, it does not fully reflect the weakness we observed in the second half of the year.\nAs a result, we expect China to decline mid-teens in Q2 versus 28% decline we saw in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year growth versus the first quarter and our second quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of negative 6% to negative 4%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2%. Wires is expected to add approximately 1.5% M&A contribution for sales incurred in the first 1.5 month of the quarter. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6.5% to negative 4.5%.\nBased on these revenue expectations, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. I would like now to give you a brief update on our progress towards leaving the world better than we found it, which is how we think about ESG. We work alongside wonderful people here at Waters, and I'm always proud when others recognize their talent and hard work. Our colleagues were recognized in the quarter for their achievements and contributions to separation science, excellence in manufacturing and for being champions of LGBTQ and women's benefits in the workplace.\nI would also like to congratulate Dr. Philip Wyatt, the founder of Wyatt Technology for receiving the esteemed Pittcon Heritage Award earlier this year. Dr. Wyatt's groundbreaking contributions to laser light scattering technology have paved the way for industry-leading advancements. From a corporate standpoint, Waters has once again been honored by Barron's, earning a place on its list of the 100 most sustainable companies in 2024. Additionally, we are delighted to announce that S&P Global has included Waters in its 2024 sustainability yearbook.\nSeparately, our commitment to robust governance practices was recently highlighted by the New England Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors. We were honored to have Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey present Waters with the 2024 public company Board of the Year Award. After recently committing to SBTI, which is the science-based targets initiative, we are now building on the excellent progress we made in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We're in the process of setting new standards towards a long-term reduction in emissions and aligning our business with the 1.5 degree centigrade future.\nNow to summarize, we're pleased with how the first quarter landed versus our expectations, which supports our full year guidance. We remain on track to achieving the 2024 objectives and look forward to building on this strength as the year progresses. Our long-term growth profile remains excellent, and we are aligned to secular tailwinds that are stronger than ever in our attractive markets. With our robust financial profile and balanced capital allocation strategy, we have an excellent platform to deliver sustained value for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Casper.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Today, I am joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would like to first point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.waters.com. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.

After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin today's call by expressing my gratitude to all my colleagues.\n2023 was another transformative year for Waters. Throughout the year, our teams kept an unwavering focus on customers, launched innovative new products and delivered strong business performance, all during highly eventful times with dynamic market conditions.\nAs 2022 ended, the results of our transformation clearly showed on the top line, having delivered several years of very strong above average sales growth. Since then, in 2023, we have demonstrated our ability to manage exceptionally well through a downturn while continuing to make investments for growth.\nIn 2023, we also initiated the next phase of our transformation with the acquisition of Wyatt. This brings with it a new vector for value creation to our shareholders through M&A and we're off to a great start. As an added benefit, it has accelerated our journey into high-growth adjacent markets, where we made continued progress with our organic investments over the course of the year. We launched new and innovative products in 2023, including our Alliance IS next-generation LC platform. We expanded our Xevo TQ mass spec into clinical applications and developed size exclusion columns for viral vectors that bear with wired malls instruments. We even had our first light scattering launch as a combined company with Data Star.\nFinally, we were recognized as 1 of the world's most sustainable companies achieving a variety of ESG awards. This includes our top 5 ranking on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list, which scores over 1,000 publicly traded companies based on 230 ESG performance indicators. We are very proud of what we've achieved at Waters in 2023.\nToday, as I share our fourth quarter and full year results, I have 3 key messages. First, we've continued to execute well. Second, our transformation is contributing to our results. And third, we are well positioned for future long-term growth.\nTurning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which was in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share landed at the high end of our guidance at $3.62 driven by strong margin performance. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.65. For the full year, sales declined 0.5% as reported and 2% in organic constant currency. Even with a constrained CapEx environment, all our regions outside of China grew in 2023 in organic constant currency terms. As expected, Wyatt successfully delivered on M&A contribution of 2.5% to sales. And with a strong EPS result in Q4, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in at $11.75, which reflects underlying growth of approximately 2% before FX headwinds of 3% and 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition.\nI will now describe our sales results in more detail. The spending environment for instruments remained challenging into year-end. However, Q4 revenue increased versus Q3 levels in all our geographies, even China, as we continue to execute well in tough macro conditions. Reported sales were $108 million higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. This reflects a 15% ramp that was consistent with our guidance for a muted year-end budget flush. For the full year, our organic constant currency sales grew 3% year-over-year, excluding China. As I mentioned earlier, the Americas, Europe and Asia, excluding China, all grew in 2023. This took a lot of effort from our sales team who did a fantastic job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the market with our competitive portfolio. As a result, on a 4-year stack basis, our ex-China growth remains at a healthy high single digits.\nA key challenge in 2023 was the abrupt turn we saw in China where conditions deteriorated as the year progressed. This was particularly the case in the pharma market where our revenues are most heavily weighted. For the full year, China sales declined more than 20% overall, which was a 5% headwind to our total growth.\nThis brings us now to our margin performance. We believe that the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management when things slow down. During 2023, we saw volume and FX headwinds, while inflationary pressure continued. We responded with stronger pricing and added further discipline to our operational objectives. We redoubled our productivity efforts, including the opening of our Global Capability Center in Bangalore, India. And we undertook proactive cost alignment as the slowdown began to emerge. This resilience focus and commitment allowed us to deliver excellent operational results in our P&L. Our full year gross margin was 59.6%, which is 160 basis points better than the previous year. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, which is 70 basis points of expansion.\nNow let me share our progress with the acquisition of Wyatt Technology. The strong start to lead sharing between Wyatt and Waters allowed us to offset a slowdown in biotech spending resulting in an on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to our full year sales. I will now give some details and how our revitalized portfolio and alignment with higher growth segments are contributing to growth as part of our transformation. Our strong results in 2023 were supported by our innovative portfolio, which helped drive customer spending. Our new products are gaining good traction in the market, including TQ Absolute, Alliance IS, and MaxPeak Premier Columns as well as several of our high-res mass spec instruments such as cyclic G3 and MRT. From an adoption perspective, this puts us in an excellent position when instrument budgets begin to normalize.\nTurning now to our adjacencies. We have continued to invest and expand into adjacent high-growth markets where our business model of solving problems in downstream regulated applications can be deployed. For bioseparations and bioanalytical characterizations, we've made organic investments, launched new products and deployed capital to M&A. Large molecule applications are now 35% of our pharma revenues and expected to trend higher, up from around 20% just a few years ago.\nFor Diagnostics, we have invested in our clinical business and added workflows for specialty applications of mass spec. This has transformed related revenue growth from that of low to mid-single digits to double digits in the past several years.\nFinally, our focus on batteries is paying dividends, where very strong growth has remained throughout the year. Revenues from battery applications are now at over 10x 2019 revenue levels, and our TA business is increasingly aligned with less cyclical faster-growing applications. Each of these exciting growth areas is delivering incremental revenue to the company.\nNow I will share some facts supporting the long-term outlook for above-average growth and provide our 2024 guidance. Since 2010, Waters has grown, on average, 6% in organic constant currency terms. For Instruments, while the standard deviation is high, long-term average growth has been 5%. For recurring revenues, the standard deviation is much lower and the average growth is 7%. As we look ahead, several vectors make us confident that this growth could be even higher. The first is even faster volume growth in segments that we serve, driven by global prescription drug sales and environmental regulations. Second is increased use of analytical instruments for characterizing large molecules and novel modalities. And third, it's about historic pricing where we expect to sustain a 100 basis point long-term tailwind in incremental growth.\nLet's take each of these growth vectors in turn. There are at least 2 key drivers of testing volume acceleration. The first is related to the adoption of GLP-1 drugs where Waters' Instruments and Columns are specified into in-process testing and QA/QC testing at the 2 leading manufacturers. We expect our position to contribute an average additional revenue growth of 30 basis points per year between now and 2030.\nThe second is PFAS testing where we've been gaining share in a rapidly expanding market, in part driven by the sensitivity and compact size of our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. We expect PFAS testing to contribute an additional 30 basis points to our revenue growth for the foreseeable future.\nFinally, Wyatt light scattering is a high-growth business, serving attractive large molecule applications. We expect it to contribute 40 basis points of core growth accretion to our business on an annualized basis. It also accelerates our ability to solve customer challenges in formulation development, bioanalytical characterization and QA/QC testing, which has positive repercussions for our Waters business as we increasingly tie our Columns, LC and mass spec into these workflows.\nI will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. We expect customer spending caution to continue in the first quarter of the year with slow budget releases for downstream implementation. We then expect to see a gradual improvement for the remainder of the year as budgets open up, market conditions improve and as prior year comparisons become easier. We expect weakness in China to continue, particularly in the first half of the year, which also plays into the growth phasing of our guide. With this initial outlook for 2024, we expect full year organic constant currency sales growth to be between negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. We expect continued strong operational performance to build leveraging our P&L with 20 to 30 basis points of further operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 3% in the range of $11.75 to $12.05.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance for 2024. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid close to a tough year in the fourth quarter with sales that were in line with our expectations despite continued market challenges. In the quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which aligned with our expectations for a 15% increase in reported revenues versus Q3. Organic constant currency sales declined 8% against the high single-digit growth comparison last year. We did observe a budget flush in the fourth quarter as sales grew across all geographies in Q4 and versus Q3. However, this year's budget flush was more muted than typical, consistent with our expectations. Our Wyatt acquisition delivered excellent results again, adding over 3% growth to the reported sales. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 11%, Industrial declined 4% and Academic & Government declined 9%.\nIn Pharma, our results were impacted by a further weakening in China, which declined 45% for the quarter. Outside of China, Pharma sales declined 4% as instrument sales were impacted by a muted budget flush in line with our expectations.\nIn Industrial, growth was flat outside of China against a tough high teens prior year comparison. China declined approximately 20% and as weakness has broadened into nonpharma segments due to weak economic conditions. Overall, we observed continued strong growth in PFAS and battery-related applications which have continued to partially offset weakness in more cyclical areas.\nIn Economic & Government, our ex-China business continued to perform well with mid-single-digit growth. However, this was more than offset by a decline of almost 40% in China, where demand has deteriorated after the benefits of stimulus ended in the second quarter.\nBy geography, in Asia fell 16% as China weakness more than offset mid-single-digit growth in the rest of Asia. The Americas declined 2% and Europe declined 6%, driven by this year's muted budget flush dynamics. By products and services, Instruments declined 20%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single digits with continued high single-digit growth outside of China. There was 1 additional day in the quarter versus the prior year.\nLooking now at our full year results. By end market, Pharma declined 5%. Industrial was flat and Academic & Government grew 10%. Excluding China, Pharma and Industrial grew low single digits, and A&G grew mid-teens for the year, each reflecting solid results against double-digit comps. Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 7%, with China declining more than 20%, while Asia ex China grew high single digits. The Americas grew 1% and Europe grew 2%. By products and services, Instruments declined 10%, which is primarily driven by China. Excluding China, Instruments declined low single digits in 2023, reflecting healthy high single-digit 4-year CAGR. Recurring revenues grew 6% overall and high single digits outside of China with robust growth throughout the year. Chemistry growth has been supported by strong customer demand for MaxPeak Premier Columns serving large molecule workflows and adoption of e-commerce. For service, growth has been supported by expansion of plan attachment. In 2023, we exceeded our objective for a further 100 basis points of service plan attachment and delivered a 200 basis point increase for the year.\nNow I will comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, in 2023, our team responded to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment together with lower incentive compensation, allowed us to deliver a fourth quarter gross margin of 61.2% and expansion of 170 basis points and fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 34.9%, an expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, our focus and efforts resulted in gross margin of 59.6% and an expansion of 160 basis points and an adjusted operating margin of 30.9% and expansion of 70 basis points, which is after reinvesting in our high-growth adjacencies. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, 50 basis points below prior year quarter. For the full year, it was 16.2%.\nOur average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 300,000 less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $3.62. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $3.65. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $11.75. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 3%, and there was a 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.84 A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nNow turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flows as cash from operation less capital expenditure free cash flow was $192 million after funding $42 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, free cash flow was $554 million after funding $161 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow were payments of $72 million related to tax reform, $26 million for Wyatt assumed liabilities and $16 million related to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. This represents a decrease of approximately $150 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt transaction. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 and as part of our balanced capital deployment objective.\nNow as we look toward the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our high-level thoughts for 2024. Similar to others in the industry, our growth in 2023 was slower than usual, driven by unprecedented weakness in China and cautious spending from customers in other regions. We view these market conditions as temporary and anticipate a gradual recovery in sales growth throughout 2024. While our customers remain healthy, market uncertainty still remains and necessitates prudence in our guide. These dynamics support full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance of negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on full year sales. We expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.3% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenues from inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 0% to 2%. We expect to extend our strong margin performance into 2024 and deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of additional operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to remain largely consistent with 2023 levels at 16.3%. Our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.\nNow rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05, which is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.\nTurning now to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We believe that customer budget release timing will be slower than typical in the first quarter. In addition, current levels of market weakness in China are not fully reflected in last year's first quarter comparison. Last year's deterioration picked up significantly in the second quarter and thereafter. The first quarter also last year benefited from A&G stimulus in China. As a result, we expect our China business to decline approximately 40% year-over-year in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 11% to negative 9%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1%, while Wyatt is expected to add approximately 3.5% to sales for the quarter. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 8.5% to negative 6.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.05 to $2.15 and which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates.\nNow I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, another transformative year for Waters. We will continue to navigate the current market environment well and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders in 2024. Before I close, I would like to share a few updates on our ESG efforts. We've made strong progress towards our environmental goals with 70% -- 77% of our electricity now sourced from renewable or low carbon sources. In 2023, we started working with the science-based targets initiative to build on this progress and develop further emissions reduction targets. We've also enhanced our climate-related disclosure with our TCFD-related reporting. Waters was recognized as 1 of the best companies to work for by the U.S. News and World Report, and we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. We're also proud that our governance has been recognized. Water's Board of Directors was named the 2024 public company Board of the Year by National Association of Corporate Directors, New England chapter.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. .\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would first like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.waters.com. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the fourth quarter of 2023, full year 2023 and 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 in organic constant currency terms.\nIn addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call given on comparable organic -- on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance predictions or projections, except as part of the regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I want to start today's call by thanking my colleagues for remaining focused on our customers in developing new products and supporting each other. Despite the challenging macro environment, our teams delivered a solid performance and did a great job capitalizing on the available opportunities through strong commercial execution. As headwinds from China and FX became greater, our indomitable teams rallied to drive productivity gains and margin expansion, resulting in strong adjusted earnings growth for the quarter. We launched innovative new products that address the critical unmet needs of our customers and further differentiate our revitalized portfolio in the attractive end markets that we serve. We also continued to make strong progress with Wyatt, including the launch of our first new light scattering instrument.\nTurning now to our results. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined by 4%. Sales outside of China were largely at or above our expectations. However, demand in China fell beyond our expectations, which ultimately led to our sales landing at the lower end of our guide. With the U.S. dollar strengthening, the currency impact on sales for the quarter was flat versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind. Viet continued its strong start contributing 4% growth to the quarter as expected. Despite the market challenges and the adverse FX impact, we expanded our gross margin percentage by 240 basis points and adjusted operating margin percentage by 380 basis points. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share, above our expectations at $2.84, an 8% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27.\nLooking now at our organic constant currency results in more detail. In the Pharma segment, U.S. pharma grew 6% and Europe grew 5% with a strong continuing performance among our large to medium-sized customers despite slow funnel velocity. In China, we saw continued weakness in pharma throughout the quarter. Market challenges in China have now broadened beyond pharma and impacted both our industrial and academic and government end market results in the quarter. Overall, sales in China declined approximately 30% as the demand environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed.\nIn the Industrial segment, China declined low teens. Outside of China, Industrial declined 6% as growth in the quarter was subdued by a tough prior year comparison of over 20%. While the most cyclical applications in industrial have continued to slow globally, we saw continued strong traction in PFAS and battery testing applications. In academic and government, we continued to see strong uptake of new products in Europe with low double-digit growth and in the Americas with mid-single-digit growth. However, this strength was more than offset by pronounced weakening in China, which declined over 30% now that the shipments related to last year's stimulus program have concluded. In our core business, while the market environment has become more difficult, we continue to deliver strong commercial results. When looking at our third quarter results outside of China, our organic constant currency sales grew low single digits year-over-year and is a healthy 7% on a 2- and 4-year [indiscernible] basis.\nOn a year-to-date basis, our organic constant currency growth has been mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding China and flat overall, including China. A key driver of performance for our business this year is mass spec, which is an area where we have gained share with our innovative new product portfolio. We're also managing our P&L very effectively through our focus on operational excellence that drove strong margin performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 59.1%, a year-over-year expansion of 240 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, expanding 380 basis points. Year-to-date, our results also showed substantial margin expansion with our gross margin up 160 basis points to 59%, and our adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 29.4%.\nLet me talk about about what drove this. First, our commercial teams have continued to achieve strong pricing results at levels that were over 250 basis points for the quarter. Second, we're beginning to realize the productivity benefits of our focus on operational excellence and digitization. I'm excited that next month, Waters' will celebrate the opening of our new global capability center in Bangalore, India, which will further accelerate our pursuit of digitization and operational excellence. Third, through our proactive cost actions, we have rapidly aligned resources to our long-term growth strategy. While the current market environment is challenging, the long-term fundamentals of our end markets continue to be excellent. As I mentioned last quarter, there are incremental growth vectors to our historical 5% instrument growth that result in a great long-term growth profile for our business. This includes global prescription drug sales, which are expected to exceed historical growth rates as well as measures we have put in place to improve pricing where we expect to sustain a more than 100 basis point improvement versus historical levels.\nIn addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development for large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for instruments such as mass spec and light scattering in our portfolio. This is only expected to strengthen as end users find value in these instruments for high volume and recurring applications such as process development, raw materials testing and quality control. The competitive edge of our revitalized portfolio also positions us well for long-term growth. Our product portfolio has been renewed in the last few years with significant innovation that is answering the critical unmet needs of our customers. This includes new launches in LC such as the Alliance IS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in the past decade.\nIn mass spec, the industry-leading sensitivity of Zevo TQ Absolute has allowed us to gain share in the food and environmental market for PFAS related testing applications. In chemistry, our MAX Peak premier columns have been the most successful launch in our company's history, serving the more complex needs of large molecule separation in our customers' labs. During the quarter, we announced 2 new product launches for bioanalytical characterization including our first new instrument launch with Viant. We launched a new bioprocess walkup solution that combines our Andrew plus liquid handling robot, 1 lab software and our BioAccord LC-MS system into a more automated setup that is even easier to use. Together, these new products help engineers capture high-quality bioprocess and drug product data directly from upstream bioreactors such as those offered by Sartorius. It achieved this via simple workflows that automate sample prep, LC-MS analysis and data capture. This accelerates the upstream development of maps and other biologic drugs providing more optimal clone selection that results in more effective titles and yields.\nSecond, we launched our first new life scattering instrument within the wire portfolio. ZetaStar is designed to measure -- to precisely measure and analyze nanoparticles used in downstream biologics and material science applications. It combines 3 life scattering techniques into a single device cutting measurement time by up to 10x compared to other methods while using extremely low sample volumes. I would now like to cover our updated 2023 guidance.\nGrowth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. We expect this to decline further in the fourth quarter sequentially. We now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the year versus our prior expectations of low double digits. The result is an incremental headwind to our full year organic constant currency growth of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guidance. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency sales growth to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1%. Despite the lower revenue guide for continuing to proactively manage our cost structure and drive productivity expansion, resulting in no change to our expected margin percentage performance versus our previous guide. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be 30.5%, which is 30 basis points of expansion versus 2022.\nOur updated full year adjusted EPS guidance is resulting in the range of $11.65 to $11.75. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined 4% against a mid-teens growth comparison last year. Waters' Division and TA both declined 4%. We saw good results again from our Wyatt acquisition, which added 4% constant currency growth and performed in line with our expectations despite the challenging environment. The impact of FX was flat in the quarter, which came in below our expectations of a 1% tailwind to as reported sales. .\nIn organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 2%, industrial declined 8% and academic and government declined 3%. In Pharma, mid-single-digit positive growth outside of China was more than offset by continued slowdown in China Pharma, which declined over 30%. In Industrial, our business declined high single digits with a tough growth comparison of 22% in the prior year quarter and due to China weakness now spilling over into nonpharma segments. We continue to see strong growth in global PFAS testing and battery testing applications.\nAcademic and government declined 3%. Outside of China, overall A&G growth was up 8%. This was led by double-digit growth in Europe and mid-single-digit growth in the Americas. In China, A&G declined over 30% as demand fell rapidly after we completed shipments under the stimulus program in the first half of the year. By geography, sales in Asia declined 12%. The Americas was flat and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China broadly declined. Excluding China, Asia grew 3%, which was in line with our expectations. India grew low double digits and Japan grew mid-teens. In Americas, Pharma grew 6%, which exceeded our expectations as we executed very well with our large to mid-pharma customers. Academic and government also grew 6%. However, strength in these 2 segments was offset by contraction in industrial for the quarter.\nIn Europe, growth exceeded our expectations in Pharma, which grew mid-single digits and academic and government, which grew 10%, while Industrial declined mid-single digits. By products and segments, instruments declined 13%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single digits overall and high single digits outside of China. There was no change in number of days versus the prior year's quarter. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost lament together with lower incentive compensation drove continued margin expansion. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.1%, an expansion of 240 basis points compared to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2022.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter was approximately 31.5%, an expansion of 380 basis points compared to 27.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.7% due to discrete items within the quarter. The average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 800,000 less than the third quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.84, an increase of 8% despite flat revenue. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $123 million after funding $38 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow was impacted by higher inventory balances. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of third quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2.2 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.2. This represents a decrease of $125 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition.\nAs previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down the debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program through the quarter and into the first half of next year. Now I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, growth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. In addition, weakness in China has now broadened beyond pharma and into industrial and academic and government end markets. We expect China growth rates to sequentially decline further in the fourth quarter and now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the full year versus our prior expectations of low double-digit decline. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guidance to the range between negative 2% and negative 1%.\nAt current exchange rates, where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most major currencies since our last earnings call, currency translation is now expected to have a 1.5% negative impact on our full year sales, which is a 150 basis point headwind versus our prior guide. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now negative 1% to flat. As Udit covered, despite incremental headwinds from China and FX, our teams have rallied to drive pricing and productivity gains. We expect this will allow us to deliver a gross margin of approximately 59% for the year, which is in line with our previous guidance and is 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. Together with proactive cost alignment, we expect this will allow us to deliver an adjusted operating margin of approximately 30.5% for the year, after funding investments in high-growth adjacencies, which is also in line with our previous guide and is 30 basis points of expansion versus last year.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.2 million shares. Now rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.65 to $11.75, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3.5 percentage points at current FX rates. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect further weakness in China and cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect fourth quarter organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 8% to negative 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%, while we expect Wyatt to add approximately 3.5% to our fourth quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6% to negative 3%.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.62, which includes a negative impact from currency of approximately 5 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So to summarize, despite a macro environment that has progressively weakened this year, we have continued to deliver a solid performance through our execution. We are also driving strong outcomes in our margin and earnings performance and are maintaining our full year gross margin and adjusted operating margin guidance despite incremental headwinds from volume and FX. We have strengthened our product portfolio even further through innovation while continuing to make strong progress with our acquisition of Wyatt.\nLater this month, we look forward to issuing our 2023 ESG report which is a transparent way to show our active progress each year on our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Some key highlights to expect relate to our continued reduction of emissions, increased renewable energy use, increase of female representation in management roles as well as the TCFD-related environmental disclosures we're initiating in this year's report. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions. ."

For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 in organic constant currency terms. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our predictions or projections, except as part of our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release was otherwise required by law.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results after we will open up the phone lines to take questions.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Before diving into the results, I would like to start by saying that I'm very proud of how our teams have executed this quarter. We delivered a solid performance across our end markets despite a challenging environment and a stronger-than-expected slowdown in China. Our revitalized portfolio is driving results in areas of high unmet need as our newly launched products continue to gain traction. And we're well positioned for future growth as we make meaningful progress and make further investment in our high-growth adjacencies.\nTurning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered at the high end of our guidance with 3% organic constant currency growth. We also had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which performed ahead of expectations and contributed 2% growth for the quarter. Overall, constant currency growth was 5% and our as-reported growth was 4%. Our organic constant currency performance was led by strong growth in the industrial segment, which grew low double digits and the academic and government segment, which grew over 20%. In both of these end markets, mass spec grew over 40% as our revitalized portfolio saw continued strong demand. In the pharma segment, which declined 4%, both the U.S. and Europe grew high single digits, showing initial signs of recovery in pharma spend. However, this was more than offset by significant worsening in the China pharma market as weakness broadened beyond CDMOs. The weakness in China also impacted our instrument growth, which declined 2% in the quarter. When excluding China, instrument growth was 8%, led by mid-teens instrument growth in the U.S. and low double-digit growth in Europe. Meanwhile, our recurring revenue grew high single digits, driven by increased service plan attachment and chemical e-commerce adoption. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in above our expectations at $2.80, driven by operational excellence across pricing and procurement as well as our cost actions. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted shares were $2.55.\nDespite the challenging macro conditions, our commercial execution remains strong. So far this year within instruments, mass spec has grown high-teens on both a year-over-year and 2-year stack basis as our commercial teams have capitalized on the strength of our renewed product portfolio. Our TA Instruments division has also seen strong results despite macro challenges, having grown low double digits year-over-year and on a 2-year stack basis. Our commercial initiatives and strong execution have enabled high single-digit growth in recurring revenue. We have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points in 2023. We're now targeting an additional 100 basis points of expansion over the remainder of the year. The strength of our execution and the quality of our service offering is helping us drive this growth, and there is further runway ahead. Price is also a key part of our execution where we built commercial muscle and discipline in recent years. We've achieved strong results in price over 200 basis points so far this year. With our operational excellence, we expect to meaningfully expand our margins this year. For the first half of 2023, our gross margin is 58.9%, which is an expansion of 110 basis points versus the first half of 2022. For the full year, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59%, which is 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. We also expect to deliver an operating margin of 30.5% this year, which is 30 basis points higher than last year.\nOur revitalized portfolio is also driving results in areas of high unmet need. I would like to share a few specific examples. First, in the industrial segment, we're seeing strong growth in PFAS testing, and we are towards the beginning of a multiyear growth opportunity. Our growth in PFAS testing is twice as fast as the 20% estimated market growth rate as we continue to take share with our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. In the academic and government segment, our high-res mass spec portfolio is seeing strong adoption at a time where global funding for R&D applications continues to be elevated. Select Series MRT is unique in the high-res mass spec market due to its enhanced resolution at high speeds, which gives it unique capabilities for metabolomics and imaging applications where throughput requirements are high. At ASMS recently, we announced new enhancements for the MRT, which increases imaging resolution by 50% and boost sample throughput even further. Earlier this year, we launched Alliance iS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade. We've continued to see strong interest in its launch and several customers have already made plans to replace their LCs with this new industry-leading platform. We now have not 1 but 2 new industry-leading LCs for QA/QC applications in pharma, Alliance iS and Arc HPLC. Both of these instruments answer significant unmet needs in the market, which continue to drive long-term growth in instrument replacement. And in our TA division, new product launches such as powder reology accessory and the battery cycle microcalimeter have supported growth in battery testing for electric vehicles. Battery testing is a fast-growing market, and we are well positioned to support demand for characterization that will lead to safer and better performing batteries. The strong results we've achieved in growing markets like batteries have allowed us to deliver double-digit growth in TA so far this year despite the challenging environment.\nWe remain well positioned for future growth and the long-term fundamentals of our business have never been better. While instruments are always prone to short-term fluctuations in spending patterns, instrument growth has been highly resilient on a long-term basis with average growth of about 5%. As we look ahead, the demand profile for our instruments has only strengthened versus this historical trend. Total global prescription drug sales, which is a key driver of instrument volume growth are expected to exceed historical growth rates for the foreseeable future. And our potential is further enhanced by the measures we have put in place to improve pricing where we expect to sustain 100 to 200 basis points improvement versus historical levels. In addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development and process optimization of large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for our business. Here, novel modalities require more advanced characterization techniques like mass spec and light scattering that have not been used in the past. We believe that this trend will not only continue, but will also pave the way for adoption of analytical instruments in high-volume, recurring applications and large molecule manufacturing. We expect this to occur as they become embedded within process control, QA/QC and raw material testing over time. We remain focused on nurturing this growth opportunity with our continued investment in bioanalytical characterization and bio separations. In bioanalytical characterization, which is a $1.8 billion total addressable market, a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate, we've been investing both organically and inorganically. We recently closed the acquisition of Wyatt, which expands our ability to characterize large molecules across various stages of production beyond that of what we can do with LC UV and LC mass spec alone. We also recently announced an expansion in our collaboration with Sartorius from upstream development into downstream manufacturing. So far, in upstream process development, we've demonstrated that bearing biocard Arc line with the Sartorius Ambr 15 and 250 bioreactors, has enabled bioprocess engineers to accelerate clone selection results from weeks to a matter of hours. Now our expanded collaboration will integrate our technologies further. We will develop analytical solutions that are in line and offer real-time monitoring of process controls and critical quality attributes in the bioreactor. By offering bioprocess engineers access to comprehensive analytical data for downstream batch and continuous manufacturing, we can support improved yields while reducing waste and lowering biomanufacturing costs. Finally, in bio separations, which is a $1.4 billion total addressable market with an 8% to 10% projected annual growth rate, we recently announced a multiyear research collaboration with Princeton University. The goal of this partnership is to advance research and drug discovery and development using novel bioseparation techniques that we're developing for large complex biomolecules.\nWe also just introduced our first release in the new line of size exclusion chromatography columns, which are designed for the separation and analysis of viral vectors in applications such as gene therapy. Our new X bridge Premier GTB SEC columns reduced the cost of gene therapies by using 3 to 10x less sample than other methods while generating faster results and providing more drug substance information. They can measure aggregation, titer and low molecular weight impurities at twice the speed of existing column at 50% greater resolution. The combination of these columns with wired multi-angle light scattering will deepen the level of information that can be acquired from a single experiment. This will accelerate development times of modalities such as adeno-associated viruses or AAV and allow for more optimized manufacturing, which can reduce costs.\nTurning now to our updated 2023 guidance. The slowdown in the pharma end market in China has progressed beyond CDMOs resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low digit -- low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Our guide does not assume any benefit from a new round of stimulus in the second half of the year. While our funnel remains healthy, we also continue to see slower than usual funnel velocity from customers more broadly. Assuming that this trend continues through the rest of the year, we expect this to translate to a full year growth headwind of approximately 100 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%.\nDespite our lower revenue guide, we are proactively managing our cost and productivity while continuing to preserve our investments in future growth. In July, we made some very difficult but necessary decisions to realign the workforce in our core business, which impacted just under 5% of our employees. These actions allow us to better align our resources with our growth strategy and offset the incremental demand weakness that I just described. This, together with our focus on operational excellence across pricing and procurement is expected to deliver a gross margin of 59% this year, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2022. We also expect to expand our operating margin approximate to approximately 30.5%, which is an increase of 30 basis points versus 2022. These actions allow us to mitigate EPS headwind from lower expected revenue, resulting in our updated full year EPS guidance of $12.20 to $12.30.\nNow I will pass the call to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales grew 4% as reported. Organic constant currency sales grew 3% as Waters division grew 2% and TA grew 11%. We had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which exceeded our expectations and added 2% constant currency sales growth. FX was a 1% headwind in the quarter.\nIn organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 4%, industrial grew 11% and academic and government grew over 20%. In pharma, high single-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, was more than offset by a pronounced slowdown in China pharma, which declined over 40%.\nIn industrial, Waters Division and TA both grew low double digits with broad strength across all regions. In our Water business, strength was led by food and environmental testing where we saw continued strong growth in global PFAS testing applications driven by our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spectrometer. In TA growth was led by thermal analysis and microcalorometry. We again saw strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronics testing which more than offset weakness in more cyclical revenues from materials and chemicals. In academic and government, there was continued strong demand in upstream applications from our refreshed mass spec portfolio supported by elevated funding levels across the globe. Mass spec sales more than doubled in the U.S., grew approximately 50% in Europe and grew 30% in Asia. By product, strength was led by our high-res mass spec portfolio with applications in metabolomics and spatial biology, resulting in strong growth for cyclic IMS and Select Series MRT.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia declined 5%, the Americas grew 7% and Europe grew 9%. In Asia, China declined [indiscernible] Excluding China, Asia grew 6%, with India growing high single digits and Japan growing mid-single digits. In the Americas, pharma grew 6%, led by 7% growth in the U.S., industrial grew 3% and academic and government grew almost 30%. In Europe, pharma grew 7%, industrial grew 6% and academic and government grew over 35%. In both Americas and Europe, these results reflect 2-year stacked growth of high single digits or above across each of the end markets. By products and services, instrument declined 2% overall as mass spec growth of almost 20% and double-digit growth in TA Instrument Systems was more than offset by China pharma demand weakness led by LC. Recurring revenues grew high single digits. Chemistry growth was supported by continued strength in MaxPeak premier columns, which grew over 50% in the quarter. Service growth continues to be supported by strong pull-through from recent instrument sales and increasing service plan attachment, which has already increased by another 100 basis points in the first half of the year. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter.\nGross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.3%, an expansion of 230 basis points compared to 57% in the second quarter of 2022. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 29.6%, an expansion of 120 basis points compared to 28.4% in the second quarter of 2022. Our margin expansion was driven by strong operational performance with pricing gains, lower material and freight costs as well as prudent management of spend. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. Average share count came in at 59 million shares, which is about 1.5 million less than the second quarter of last year.\nOn non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.80. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.55. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $73 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow is impacted by higher inventory balances, timing of income tax payments and wire transaction expenses. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out, attractive adjacent markets.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $2.3 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3. This represents an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter, which is related primarily to the Wyatt acquisition. As we previously disclosed, we have temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year to use our free cash flow to delever the acquisition.\nNow I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, the slowdown in China pharma has progressed beyond CDMOs, resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Additionally, while our funnel remains strong, we are observing longer capital purchasing approval cycles amongst our customers broadly due to spending caution in the current environment. We expect these dynamics to continue through the rest of the year and contribute an additional 100 basis points full year growth headwind versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guide to 0.5% to 1.5%, which translates to a 2-year stack growth of approximately 6% to 6.5%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on the full year sales. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect wire transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 3% to 4%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59% for the year, which is 100 basis points expansion versus last year and is higher than our previous guide. We expect margin to be approximately 30.5%, which translates to 30 basis points of margin expansion versus last year.\nCost actions in our core business are expected to deliver approximately $45 million in annualized savings and are expected to contribute $20 million in 2023, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We will progressively redeploy part of these savings to resource our growth strategy and to expand capacity on high-growth end market opportunities. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59 million, given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $12.20 to $12.30, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point at the current FX rates.\nLooking to the third quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China. We also expect cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect third quarter organic constant currency sales growth of negative 4% to negative 2%, which translates to 2-year stacked growth of approximately 5.5% at midpoint, given the mid-teens comp from last year. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately 1%, and we expect to Wyatt to add approximately 4% to our third quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total third quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1% to 3%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 with a neutral currency impact. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. Even through challenging times in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to come together as an organization to ensure we leave this world better than we found it. With our vibrant employee circles, we recently celebrated Pride Month as well as our Fantastic Women in Engineering. We also kicked off our third year of Water Student Academy, a summer program for high school students from underserved communities who are interested in exploring a career in science. We're also very proud recognized as 1 of U.S. News and World Report Best Companies to Work For. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone line to questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions, including with respect to the close of the Wyatt transaction that impacts Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2023 and full year 2023.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website.\nUnless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nFinally, we do not intend to update our predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key messages for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. So this morning, I'll start by giving you color on our first quarter results as well as our updated guidance. Then I will cover some of our recent product launches, including Alliance IS, and I will also provide an update on Wyatt.\nOur first quarter results were below our expectations with revenue growth of 3% on a constant currency basis versus our expected 4% to 6% growth. This was largely driven by weaker-than-expected demand for instruments in biotech and pharma, which I will cover in a moment. As you know, we had an extraordinary Q1 last year with 16% constant currency growth.\nEven though our first quarter this year was slower than expected, it still represents a very healthy 2-year stacked growth of approximately 9.4%. We also saw overall good overall strength in our recurring revenues, which continued to grow in the high single digits as well as mass spec and DA, both of which grew double digits.\nOur end markets remain resilient, and our leadership team continues to drive strong commercial execution. We have further strengthened our revitalized portfolio with a steady stream of innovative new products.\nFinally, we've added M&A to our growth strategy with our pending acquisition of Wyatt. And we continue to invest organically in our high-growth adjacencies, which are also on track and are gaining momentum.\nReviewing our first quarter results in more detail, our performance was impacted by a combination of 3 factors: first, China was weaker than anticipated as pharma customers scale back purchases. Second, while we have limited exposure to pre-commercial biotech, we have seen a pronounced scale back in demand from these customers as they have significantly reduced spending to conserve capital. And third, several of our large to medium-sized pharma customers delayed timing of instrument orders due to macroeconomic caution.\nEach of these dynamics occurred late in the quarter and led to instruments declining 3% after they grew over 25% in the first quarter of last year.\nBy end market, the impact was to our pharma business, which declined 4% overall. This was offset by strength in the Academic and Government segment, which grew 45% and Industrial, which grew 3%, while our recurring revenues remained strong across service and chemistry.\nAs a result of this lower-than-expected volume, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted shares also came below our expectations at $2.49 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38.\nAs we look ahead, we are assuming that spending among pharma customers in China will remain scale back for the balance of the year. And while our exposure to pre-commercial biotech is low, we also believe that the slowdown in this space is likely to persist for the remainder of the year. As a result, we're lowering our 2023 guide due to these 2 factors.\nWe now expect our full year organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We believe that large to medium pharma size budgets remain in place. We expect spending among these customers to catch up and be stronger in the second half of the year after delayed spending in the first half.\nDespite our revised revenue guide, our full year EPS guidance and free cash flow generation expectations remain unchanged. We intend to proactively manage our spend and working capital and Amol will cover this in more detail.\nEven with short-term market challenges, our sources for growth remain intact. Our end markets are robust with almost 80% of our business exposed to durable growth areas. This includes demand for QA/QC testing of commercialized medicines, increased scrutiny of PFAS in food and water and the testing of batteries used in applications such as electric vehicles.\nOur team has developed a strong commercial discipline that is supported by best-in-class innovative new products that address evolving customer unmet needs. We're also seeing high single-digit growth in our recurring revenues, which are over 50% of our annual sales.\nChemistry growth is supported by strong end-market activity, growth in biologic applications with our MaxPeak Premier Columns and our e-commerce initiative. For service, we're seeing strong pull-through from our instrument sales and increased service plan attachment is supporting the growth.\nWe expect service plan attachment for our instruments to increase by another 100 basis points this year, building on the 350 basis point expansion since 2019. Our revitalized portfolio has been further strengthened with the recent launch of Alliance IS, which is our next-generation intelligent HPLC system.\nWe believe it is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade, and it provides a major leap forward in lab productivity. Not only is the instrument easy to use with its large touchscreen interface but can eliminate common user errors by up to 40%. It does this by guiding users between steps with a highly intuitive interface. It intelligently conducts a number of real-time system checks before a sample is run. This helps ensure that the instrument is configured correctly for the method that is being tested.\nBefore now, errors such as incorrect solvent or the wrong column being used are usually discovered after the sample has been run, which results in wasted time and a wasted sample. Given the strength of the Alliance brand and the significant new features that this instrument offers, we had a strong reception at its launch.\nSince quality testing is such a critical component of pharmaceutical manufacturing, customer interest has been strong, including from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, who noted that Alliance IS feels like the future is here. and has already made plans to replace a large number of its LCs with this instrument.\nWe now have not 1, but 2 new industry-leading platforms for QA/QC applications in pharma, Arc HPLC and its biocompatible equivalent are premier and now higher-end Alliance IS, which sits at the top of the range. Last month, we also launched our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec into clinical applications. Not only is this the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market for PFAS detection, where it has seen strong traction in food and environmental testing, but now within clinical, it is up to 5x more sensitive than other competing instruments in the segment.\nThis sensitivity enables clinical labs to detect and measure trace level analytes at lower detection levels than was previously possible. It also enables Pinnacle Labs to expand their test menu to include multiplex panels.\nMeanwhile, our TA Instruments business launched a new microcalorimeter for battery testing essentially for electric vehicles, energy storage and electronics applications. This provides customers with a significant upgrade as it accelerates validation of battery safety, quality and performance testing by up to 75%, while collecting up to 6x more data than other calorie meters.\nLastly, we also recently launched a new system monitoring software product on WatersConnect, first for us and unique to the industry, developed in consultation with QA/QC scientists it enables real-time monitoring of all chromatography instruments controlled by our Empower software. It helps increase productivity of QA/QC labs by allowing customers to analyze their instrument fleet at any time from anywhere to monitor uptime, usage levels and real-time system availability.\nEach of these new products have been developed in close collaboration with our customers to address their most pressing unmet needs. They further support the strength of our revitalized portfolio.\nEarlier this year, we announced our intent to acquire Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering. With more than 80% of its revenues tied to large molecule applications, Wyatt expands Waters' portfolio increases -- and increases our exposure to faster growth areas within biologics.\nIt also increases our ability to build a business in bioanalytical characterization, which is a USD 1.8 billion total addressable market with a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate. We remain on track to close in the second quarter of this year. We also expect the transition to deliver immediate growth and adjusted operating margin accretion.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our first quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales grew 3% in constant currency. This came below our expectations due to the demand dynamics in our Pharma business, which Udit outlined earlier.\nWaters division grew 2% and TA grew 10%. By end market, Pharma declined 4%, Industrial grew 3% and Academic and Government was very strong at 45% growth.\nIn Pharma, weakness was led by China and the U.S. In China, we saw customers recalibrate their spending plans. And in the U.S., our large to medium pharma customers delayed spending due to macroeconomic caution. Our small biotech customers, which is a small portion of our business, scale back spending to conserve capital in light of more pronounced funding concerns.\nIn Industrial, growth was led by Asia, which grew 6% and the Americas, which grew 2%. In our Waters business, we saw continued strong growth in PFAS testing applications. In TA, growth was led by thermal analysis and rheology. We have seen continued strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronic testing.\nAcademic and Government had a great start to the year as elevated funding resulted in strong demand for our refreshed mass spec portfolio. Strength was broad across all our geographies. By product, strength was broad across our high-res mass specs, such as Cyclic IMS and our tandem cards, such as TQ Absolute.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia grew 6%. The Americas declined 1% and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China declined mid-single digits for the quarter. Excluding China, Asia grew mid-teens with broad strength across our end markets. In the Americas, Pharma declined mid-single digits given delayed spending against a tough comp of over 30%.\nIndustrial grew 2% and Academic and Government grew over 25%. Europe grew 3% in the quarter with strength also led by Academic and Government, which grew over 40%. By products and services, instruments declined 3% overall, but both our mass spec and TA Instrument systems grew double digits.\nRecurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry up 10% and service up 8%. This quarter had 1 fewer day than the first quarter of 2022, which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.5% compared to 58.6% in the first quarter of 2022, in line with our expectations.\nOperating margin for the quarter was approximately 26.8% compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2022 driven by sales mix and 120 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.4%. Average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about $1.6 million less than the first quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter was $2.49 in comparison to $2.80 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning, and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $166 million after funding $34 million of capital expenditures, which represents approximately 24% of our sales.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth including M&A and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive adjacent markets. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 173,000 shares of our common stock for $58 million early in the quarter.\nAs we previously disclosed, we have since temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year so that we can use our free cash flow to fund the Wyatt acquisition.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $990 million, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.\nNow I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. Our end markets remain resilient, and we expect our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives to enhance our performance. However, as Udit covered earlier, we are revising our growth expectations to account for the scale back of purchases from our customers in China and the slowdown in small biotech.\nAs a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guidance to 3% to 5%, excluding it. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on full year sales, resulting in full year reported organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%.\nConsistent with our prior expectations, we expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 5.5% to 7.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt.\nWe expect organic gross margins to be approximately 58.5% for the year and organic operating margins to be approximately 30.5%. This is higher than our previous guide due to anticipated cost savings in our core business and an improvement in FX. This now translates to 50 basis points of margin expansion, net of investment in adjacencies, partially offset by an FX headwind of 20 basis points.\nAs we previously mentioned, we anticipate the expected addition of Wyatt in Q2 of this year will be accretive to our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin by approximately 25 basis points.\nExcluding the Wyatt transaction, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Consistent with our prior expectations, the transaction is expected to add $40 million of additional interest expense for a total of $80 million interest expense.\nThe full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.3 million given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program.\nRolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance, excluding the Wyatt transaction is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90 and which is unchanged from our previous guide and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point at current rates.\nIncluding Wyatt, non-GAAP full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is also unchanged, projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the second quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China, along with the slowdown in pre-commercial biotech.\nWe also expect cautious spending levels from our large pharma customers to continue until end of the second quarter before catching up in the second half of the year. Hence, we expect second quarter organic constant currency sales growth of 1% to 3%.\nAt today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in second quarter reported organic sales growth guidance of 0% to 2%. Assuming a mid-May close, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.5% to our second quarter revenue growth.\nTherefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1.5% to 3.5%, including Wyatt. Excluding the Wyatt transaction, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 with a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points. Including Wyatt, which is expected to result in an EPS headwind of $0.08 Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $2.52 to $2.62.\nNow I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So to summarize, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, our end markets are resilient, and we expect to see increased trends in the second half of the year.\nWhile we have revised our revenue guide, we're maintaining our full year EPS guide due to our robust financial model. And the acceleration of our growth strategy remains on track with continued progress on all of our high-growth adjacencies and with our pending acquisition of Wyatt Technology.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues around the world who continue to demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Waters with their focus on strong commercial execution and revitalized innovation. We also look forward to welcoming our future Wyatt colleagues.\nFinally, I'm proud to share that Waters continues to be globally recognized for its strong ESG profile, placing at #5, on the Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for 2023. This is the second year that we've been placed in the top 10 after receiving more than 20 awards in 2022 recognizing the company for excellence in product innovation, leadership strength and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate our commitment to leave the world better than we found it.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

(Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are very pleased to be speaking to you from Santa Barbara this morning, where Wyatt Technology is located. We have a lot to cover today given our exciting -- given our earnings results and our exciting announcement. Today, I am joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also glad to be joined by Wyatt Technology's Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Wyatt; as well as its President, Cliff Wyatt.\nNow before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding future, possible results and commentary on potential market and business conditions, including with respect to the announced transaction with Wyatt that may impact Waters Corporation over the first quarter of 2023, full year 2023 and 2024.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially.

Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Before diving in, I would like to extend our thoughts and our prayers to the thousands of those who're affected in Turkey and ceria by the earthquakes. Today, marks a major milestone in accelerating value creation for our customers and shareholders as we progress to the next step in the execution of our strategy. This morning, we made the exciting announcement that Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering, will be joining forces with Waters, bringing with it a fast-growing, attractive business with key capabilities to accelerate our $1.8 billion double-digit growth opportunity in bioprocess characterization.\nMore than 40 years ago, Wyatt was the first to commercialize light scattering instruments, incorporating lasers as their light source. Ever since, they've defined and redefined state-of-the-art light scattering instrumentation, software and services. Along the way, they've also added several related technologies, including dynamic light scattering, viscometry, refractometry and field-flow fractionation. Together, their innovative products are used to determine the properties of novel therapeutics, such as cell and gene therapy, vaccines and proteins as well as synthetic polymers and nanoparticles.\nWyatt was the top asset and priority we identified for bioanalytical characterization, making the acquisition a significant step forward in this high-growth adjacencies. I would like to take this opportunity to invite Jeff and Cliff to say a few words about this exciting combination. Jeff?\n\nGeofrey Wyatt\n\nThank you, Udit. We are thrilled to be with you here today at this incredible moment for our company. For over 4 decades, Wyatt Technology has delighted customers with industry-leading innovation in light scattering, characterizing life-enhancing large molecule therapeutics. Our common scientific heritage, deep mutual respect for science-based innovation and a passion for customer success makes Waters the ideal steward to propel our family legacy into its next chapter. Now Cliff, would you like to add anything?\n\nClifford Wyatt\n\nThank you, Jeff, I would like to echo your comments and also my father's, Dr. Wyatt's sentiment that we could not have been more excited or could not be more excited about this combination. Waters will broaden Wyatt's global reach, scale and will accelerate deployment of light scattering technologies in downstream and QA/QC spaces integrating this technology onto Water's well-established Empower platform. Waters is such a natural and logical fit for us in this next exciting chapter of Wyatt's history.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, Cliff. We are honored to get this unique opportunity to carry Wyatt forward into the future. This combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other. And as you highlighted, Jeff, our shared deep scientific culture and common passion for customer success will accelerate integration and drive value creation for our customers and shareholders in the years to come.\nToday, Waters has a strong and growing portfolio serving large molecule separation and characterization, which are approximately 30% of our pharmaceutical revenues. These applications serve high-volume downstream workflows in biologic development and QA/QC central labs using LC/UV and LC mass spec. Wyatt's significant exposure to the very fast-growing biologic applications will build on this presence and will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecules, including gene therapy and viral vectors.\nFor Wyatt, as Cliff mentioned, this combination will provide expanded geographic reach and will accelerate the adoption of light scattering in downstream applications through our established presence and Empower Informatics platform.\nAs you can tell, we're excited to share more details about the strategic benefits of this combination. However, this is our fourth quarter and our full year's earnings call, and we have some excellent results to share with you first. So now I will cover our key messages and financial results for the core business. Then we will continue outlining the value of this combination as we take this next step in the evolution of our strategy.\nLooking at our financial results, we ended another very successful year, delivering strong results in the fourth quarter, with growth across our end markets. This was led by yet another outstanding double-digit instrument growth quarter. Our incredible performance this year would not have been possible without our dedicated and talented colleagues. We overcame numerous macroeconomic and pandemic-related challenges throughout 2022, including global supply chain challenges, COVID lockdowns, inflationary pressures and currency headwinds, all while responding to high customer demand for our products.\nToday, we have 3 key messages, which reflect the strength in our core business and the exciting future that lies ahead. First, we continue to deliver consistently strong execution. You can see this in our 2022 performance, where we sustained strong growth after a stellar year in 2021.\nYou can also see this in our 3-year CAGR of approximately 9% in constant currency, where our results have placed us amongst the top players in the industry since the beginning of our transformation.\nSecond, our revitalized portfolio has contributed to our growth, and we expect this to continue. New products have resulted in growth opportunities in large molecule applications, PFAS and battery testing, while supporting strong core instrument replacement.\nThird, while we have accomplished a lot in the past 2.5 years, we are now augmenting our organic efforts with M&A to accelerate our journey into high-growth adjacencies.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 3% as reported, and 9% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and regions with robust customer demand. Industrial was again our fastest-growing end market, up 14%, led by environmental testing, which grew over 20%, and TA, which grew mid-teens.\nPharma saw continued robust growth, up 6%, with strength in both small and large molecule applications. Strength was led by Europe, which grew low double digits, offset by headwinds in China. Academic and government grew 8% as increased activity and funded -- funding resulted in strong year-end spending in several of our geographies.\nInstruments grew double digits, led by mass spec. New products contributed across our portfolio with Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and Cyclic unit sales growing over 40%. Meanwhile, our newest instrument launches, Xevo TQ Absolute and Xevo G3 saw excellent continued traction with very strong demand.\nRecurring revenues grew high single digits, supported by our e-commerce and service attachment growth initiatives. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.84. This is up 5% year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 8%. For the full year, revenue grew 7% as reported, and 12% in constant currency.\n2022 was a very strong year for Waters, where we executed well throughout the organization against a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our growth was broad-based across our geographies and end markets, each of which grew low double digits or above. This strength was led by instrument sales, which grew 16% for the year, with LC, mass spec and TA systems, all growing double digits. For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $12.02. This is up 7% year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 9%.\nNow as we enter 2023, our end markets remain robust and healthy, with strong customer demand for our products. These attractive end markets have durable growth drivers and are well funded. We saw solid order growth in the fourth quarter, and our backlog remains at elevated levels. We expect the strong instrument sales we saw in 2022 to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. So our end markets are healthy. We've regained our commercial momentum. Innovation has been revitalized, and we have strengthened our organization with new leadership capabilities, bringing a proven track record in transformation. Now we're entering the next phase of our execution strategy as we accelerate our path toward faster growth.\nThis brings us now to the chart on the next slide. As you can see, biologics manufacturing is a complex process. And we have shared an example, which shows how large-scale monoclonal antibodies are produced. It starts with the upstream production of the drug substance, where the raw material components are fingerprinted and monitored during initial cell culture creation before the protein or antibody of choice is produced.\nThen in downstream manufacturing, cells and debris are separated from the map in a series of filtration and separation steps. Each step involves numerous stages of testing to ensure that the product is stable and effective.\nThen, as a last step, in QA/QC, the final purified drug product is formulated and filled in vials of prefilled syringes. Throughout the process, different tools and technologies are required for characterization, depending upon what you need to analyze. Liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or LC/UV, is used extensively across all 4 stages.\nAt the same time, mass spec is increasingly being used with BioAccord seeing a lot of traction in cell culture media characterization, clone selection and process optimization in both upstream and downstream manufacturing. It is also seeing adoption in QA/QC applications. We shared details on this at the beginning of the year and have included a slide in the appendix.\nIn addition to LC/UV and LC/MS, powerful techniques such as dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering are also used to give relevant information about the size, molecular weight and aggregation of biologics. By combining the data from each of these detectors, our customers can develop a more comprehensive profile of their biologics. This is essential to speeding up the manufacturing process and reducing the cost of complex biologics such as cell and gene therapies.\nThe bioanalytical characterization market is around $1.8 billion, growing around 10% to 12%. Waters already has a strong established position in LC/UV and LC mass spec, whereas Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in light scattering. Hence, this combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other and will accelerate our journey in this opportunity.\nLet me now ask Jeff to describe the company and its highly innovative portfolio. Jeff?\n\nGeofrey Wyatt\n\nThanks, again, Udit. Well, Wyatt is a remarkable company, and we owe much of its success in high-growth applications to our amazing team. Our flagship technology is multi-angle light scattering, MALS, which is used by leading biopharma, biotech and academic institutions to measure fundamental properties of complex biologics, including cell and gene therapies, mRNA vaccines, biopolymers, biosimilars and therapeutic proteins. We're based here in Santa Barbara, California, and have 225 outstanding employees, of whom roughly 25% have PhDs. Over the past 40 years, we've built Wyatt into the recognized leader in light scattering detection, defining the segment very much like Waters did for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.\nOur sales have grown around 20% on a 3-year CAGR to approximately $110 million in 2022. We're also a highly profitable business with an adjusted operating margin of approximately 40%.\nMore than 80% of our revenues are in large molecule applications. Our biopharma customers are eager to use light scattering for QA/QC applications and have been keen for us to combine our software with Empower. So you can only imagine how excited we are with this combination, which will add additional choices and capabilities for our existing customers and let us delight even more. Now back to you, Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff. I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Waters. Let's now talk about some of the benefits that integrating Wyatt and Waters' capabilities would provide for our customers. In our existing Waters portfolio, our LC systems separate, complex mixtures into individual constituents for both property analysis by UV and detailed characterization by mass spec. These are properties such as titer aggregation and protein segments.\nThe missing piece has been additional critical information about the intact molecule, like the empty/full capsid ratio of adeno-associated viruses, or the size of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA therapies. These will be augmented by Wyatt's MALS detectors, which would allow our customers to develop a more comprehensive critical quality attribute profile for their biologics. This is essential to fully characterizing their manufacturing process.\nIn each case, for these tools to gain successful adoption in point-of-use settings, they must be, #1, sophisticated but simple for use in high-volume applications such as what we've already demonstrated with BioAccord. #2, supported by leading service like Waters already has to help run workflows and respond to evolving needs. And #3, and most importantly, they need to be connected to a common informatics platform so that all the data comes together in one place.\nOur ambition is to create an ecosystem of sophisticated yet simple instruments that can all use Empower to collect data and submit to regulators, no differently than what Waters established for small molecules years ago.\nThis transaction will create a number of compelling revenue synergies and results in an attractive set of pro forma financials. First, from a geographic footprint, Waters revenues are highly diversified, whereas Wyatt's presence is concentrated in the United States. This provides us an opportunity to expand Wyatt's geographic footprint in Europe and Asia, particularly in China.\nSecond, HPLC instruments and size exclusion chemistry columns are sold together with light scattering instruments. We expect to see cross-selling synergies with our liquid chromatography instruments and chemistry. Third, Wyatt's instruments and expertise will enable Waters to meaningfully accelerate the high-growth adjacency opportunity in bioanalytical characterization. This will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecule applications, and will augment our ability to create a comprehensive bioanalytical platform.\nAnd fourth, Wyatt's portfolio is well established in upstream development, settings for large molecule applications today. Waters' Empower platform, as well as presence -- as well as our presence and expertise in high-volume downstream recurring applications will accelerate the use of light scattering in biologics manufacturing and in QA/QC.\nNow to the pro forma. The combination will increase our large molecule footprint to around 35% of our pharmaceutical revenues. Our increased exposure to these faster-growing markets will raise the combined growth profile of the markets we serve by at least 50 basis points. We expect the transaction to contribute more than 60 basis points to our annualized constant currency growth over the next 5 years. We also expected to add more than 50 basis points to our industry-leading adjusted operating margin.\nNet, we expect to realize a high single-digit plus return on invested capital by year 5. Although we expect the Wyatt's business to grow low double digits in the near to midterm, in addition, we expect this combination to create more than $70 million in annualized revenue synergies by year 5.\nNow I would like to pass the call to Amol to walk us through further details on the financing. He will then continue covering our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2023. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. It's been great to work with Jeff, Cliff and the entire team at Wyatt Technology. Like Udit, I'm very thankful to the Wyatt family for considering us as the rightful stewards of their mission and legacy and for providing us this opportunity to create value for our customers and for our shareholders.\nNow with the transaction highlights. This $1.36 billion investment will result in immediate accretion of our revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin percentage. The synergies that Udit just described, along with Wyatt's highly attractive financials, are expected to result in accretive non-GAAP EPS impact as early as first quarter of 2024.\nAltogether, as Udit mentioned, this combination is expected to deliver a high single-digit plus return on invested capital by year 5. We will fund this investment through cash on our balance sheet and existing debt capacity that is available on our revolver. On day 1, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.3. We will temporarily suspend our share buyback program for the remainder of 2023, and will utilize our free cash flow to pay down the debt through the rest of the year.\nWe expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to land at around 1.7 by year-end 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\nNow to our fourth quarter financial results. We delivered an excellent close to a very strong year for Waters, with constant currency growth of 9%. Waters Division grew 8% and TA grew 15%. By end market, Pharma grew 6%, Industrial grew 14% and academic and government grew 8%, which Udit already covered.\nBy geography, sales in Asia grew 7%, Americas grew 8% and Europe grew 11%. In Asia, growth in region overall was strong. Japan grew 25% and India grew 15%. China declined low single digits for the quarter as a sharp increase in COVID infections at year-end resulted in delayed spending due to customer site closures. We expect these headwinds from the post zero COVID reopening to continue into the first quarter of 2023 before catching up throughout the remainder of the year.\nIn other regions, the U.S. grew 8% and Europe grew 11% with broad strength across end markets. By products and services, Instruments grew 10%, led by mass spec, which grew over 30%. Recurring revenues grew 7%, with Chemistry up 8% and Service up 7%. Finally, TA grew 15%, with double-digit growth across our major geographies. Growth was led by sales in electronics and battery applications as well as strong growth in advanced materials and chemical testing.\nLooking now at our full year results. By end market, Pharma grew 10%, Industrial grew 15% and academic and government grew 13%. In pharma, growth was led by large molecule applications, which grew mid-teens, while small molecule grew high single digits. By geography, sales in Asia grew 12%, Americas grew 14% and Europe grew 10%.\nBy products and services, Instruments grew 16% for the full year, with liquid chromatography, mass spec and TA system sales all up double digits. In our recurring revenues, chemistry grew 9%, supported by our strong launch of MaxPeak Premier Columns in large molecule applications and further expansion in digital commerce adoption.\nService grew 8% with continued expansion in attachment rates, which increased 150 basis points in 2022 and have increased 350 basis points since 2019.\nNow I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.4%, up 140 basis points versus prior year, driven by sales volume and pricing, partially offset by inflationary costs. For the full year, gross margin came in as expected at 58%. Operating margin for the quarter was 33.7%, growth of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by gross margin dynamics.\nFor the full year, operating margin was approximately 30.2%, which was flat with last year. On an underlying basis, we expanded our operating margins by approximately 100 basis points versus our guide of 20 to 30 basis points at the beginning of the year. This is net of our investments in higher growth adjacencies and despite the higher instrument mix in our revenue.\nOn an as-reported basis, our expansion was offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds and 20 basis points of additional compensation to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 17.6%, and for the full year, it was 15.6%. For the full year, as anticipated, our effective tax rate increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to change regarding the capitalization of R&D costs. Average share count came in at 59.6 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the fourth quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $3.84 compared to $3.67 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $3.81. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share increased 7% to $12.02 versus $11.20 in the prior year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 9%. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $11.73.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $145 million after funding $62 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $8 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations.\nIn the quarter, we continued to build inventory to secure supply and build safety stock given strong instrument demand. For the full year, free cash flow was $506 million after funding $176 million of capital expenditures and includes approximately $100 million of additional inventory versus the prior year-end. Excluding -- excluded from the free cash flow was $32 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations and a $38 million tax reform payment.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, which will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out attractive adjacent markets.\nIn Q4, we repurchased approximately 475,000 shares of our common stock for $149 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1.\nNow as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2023. We have seen strong performance throughout 2022, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across our geographies and new product introductions driving growth. As we enter 2023, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid in our durable end markets, and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance.\nThese dynamics support a full year 2023 guidance of organic constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, excluding Wyatt. At current rates, negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in full year reported organic sales growth guidance of 4% to 5.5%. We expect the Wyatt transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023. And depending on the timing, we expect it to add approximately 2% to 3% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is 6% to 8.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt.\nFor the full year 2023, organic gross margin is expected to be approximately 58%, and organic operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Before FX, this includes 20 to 30 basis points of net margin expansion after 70 to 80 basis points of investment in high-growth adjacencies. FX is expected to be a headwind of 50 basis points, particularly in the first half of the year.\nThe addition of Wyatt in Q2 is expected to be accretive to our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin by 20 to 30 basis points. Excluding the transaction, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $42 million. The transaction is expected to add $27 million to $43 million of additional interest expense, depending on the timing of the close. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%.\nSince we will be temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for the remainder of the year, and using free cash flow to pay down debt, our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million.\nRolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance, excluding the transaction, is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90. This represents 6% to 7% growth versus last year and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. The Wyatt transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS as early as in the first quarter of 2024. And this is even net of our share buyback suspension for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we expect it to deliver a high single-digit plus adjusted return on invested capital, net of tax by year 5.\nDue to interest expense incurred on higher debt balance, and the suspension of share repurchase program this year, the transaction is expected to result in a 2023 EPS headwind of approximately $0.15. Hence, including Wyatt, non-GAAP full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75.\nLooking to the first quarter of 2023, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 4% to 6%, which is 10% to 11% on a 2-year stacked growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points, resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of flat to 2%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, with a negative currency impact of approximately 6 percentage points.\nNow I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. As I outlined at the beginning of our transformation journey and later at our Investor Day last year, our first focus was to regain our commercial momentum and strengthen our organization with new leadership capabilities. As you have observed over the last 2.5 years, we have delivered incredible results with consistently strong execution. And we have assembled an amazing leadership team that brings with it a proven track record in transformation, which is pivotal to driving seamless integration.\nOur second focus was to revitalize our portfolio. The success of our new product launches, the increased vitality index of our portfolio and the rich pipeline ahead of us underscores our accomplishments this year. Today, we're entering our next phase, which is to accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders by adding a fantastic, fast-growing technology platform and increasing our capabilities to address high-growth adjacent markets.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

(Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events, or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the fourth quarter of 2022, all year 2022 and 2023.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning, and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nIn addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key messages for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look of our financial results. After we will open the phone lines up to take questions. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We continue to deliver excellent results in the third quarter with very strong growth across our product portfolio, our end markets and geographies. This was led by instrument growth of more than 20%. Similar to previous quarters, orders again outpaced sales.\nA result like this takes an exceptional effort and dedication from all our colleagues, we are very proud of what our teams continue to consistently deliver. Today, we have 3 key messages to share, which reflect the ongoing strength and exciting drivers of our business.\nFirst, we are consistently delivering strong commercial execution. Our transformation has become embedded in how we operate with a relentless focus on commercial excellence. You can see this in our results.\nSecond, innovation at Waters is back. It's delivering across our portfolio and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refreshed product portfolio is answering our customers' unmet needs across a variety of applications. Adoption rates for new instruments have been impressive and are driving market share gains.\nThirdly, our growth initiatives are gaining traction. We continue to make measurable progress on our high-growth adjacencies and have proof points that are giving us confidence.\nTurning now to our third quarter results. Our revenue grew 7% as reported, and 15% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and geographies with robust demand from our customers.\nGrowth in the quarter was led by industrial and academic and government, which both grew over 20% and pharma, which grew 9%. Each of our regions grew double digits. China grew over 20%. India grew 20%. Europe grew mid-teens, and the U.S. grew 11%.\nInstruments grew over 20% with our LC, mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Mass spec growth was very strong at almost 40%. Recurring revenues grew 10%, supported by our growth initiatives in e-commerce and service attachment.\nOur Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.64. This is roughly flat year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 13%.\nNow looking at our year-to-date performance, we're executing well throughout the organization despite a tough macroeconomic environment. Our strength has been broad-based across our geographies and end markets. Each of which are up double digits this year.\nPharma is up 12%. Industrial is up 15%, and academic and government is up 16%. The instrument growth has been very strong throughout the year, growing 19% year-to-date, led by the U.S. at almost 30%. We expect this to take future growth in our recurring revenues.\nOur transformation has allowed us to consistently deliver excellent results. Our 3-year CAGR underscores the momentum we've built across our business. Year-to-date, we've delivered 9%, 3-year stacked growth overall on a constant currency basis.\nMoving on to our second key message, innovation. Waters has long been known as an innovation leader. Our investments in innovation are again driving results and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Sales of Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and Max Premier Columns again doubled in the quarter versus the previous year.\nOur new products are solving problems that matter to our customers, supported by our technical strength and strong commercial execution. Arc HPLC is driving customers to upgrade their LC fleet used for routine small molecule analysis. This is advancing customer lab capabilities and productivity while accelerating the cadence of instrument replacement.\nOur MaxPeak Premier technology separates complex molecules like biologics. By eliminating the need for passivation, MaxPeak Columns can get scientists answers up to 20x faster than their non-Premier equivalent. They also gave sharper peaks with 12x the sensitivity when separating oligonucleotides as an example.\nThe customer benefits around Premier are very compelling. This has resulted in significant large molecule growth in recent quarters, which now accounts for over 30% of our pharma revenues versus 20% just a few years ago. Today, biologics represents 20% of the pharmaceutical market, but account for 40% of the R&D pipeline, positioning us very well for future growth.\nWith our cyclic ion mobility separation, high-resolution mass spec, Cyclic IMS for short, scientists can separate molecules by shape as well as mass due to the combination of ion mobility with time-of-flight. This is providing customers with amplified resolution and clarity. Demand has ramped up for Cyclic within OMEX research for lipids, proteins and metabolites, all exciting areas within early disease detection and discovery.\nAs an example, the largest privately funded mass [spectrometry] facility in Canada has been using Cyclic for antibody sequencing and discovery. They're impressed with the quality of data that Cyclic has provided supporting their lab at the forefront of scientific discovery.\nAlso within mass spec, we're seeing great traction for our recently launched Xevo TQ Absolute. It has seen strong demand in food and environmental applications, led by Per and perfluorinated compound testing. The PFAS testing market has seen rapid growth in recent months, driven by increased surveillance testing and newly added compounds of interest. We see this as a multiyear growth opportunity.\nIn June of this year, the U.S. EPA announced new drinking water health advisories for the 4 most notorious PFAS compounds setting measurement levels finer than part-per-billion. TQ Absolute is so sensitive, it can detect PFAS at 1 part-per-quadrillion. This is less than a grain of sand in an Olympic-sized Summing pool.\nTQ Absolute's ability to quantitate low abundance molecules is beyond anything on the market and gives us the right to win in this space. Since launching TQ Absolute, we won competitive placements for PFAS testing across every region. In one example, a large global testing organization is using its infant food and water testing in Southeast Asia. This customer is developing a new set of methods that are -- that can be used for routine testing across workflows in their organization.\nWithin informatics, waters_connect is enabling exciting new analytical areas in large molecule analysis. On instruments like the G3 QTof and BioAccord. This includes cell culture media analysis, peptide mapping and oligonucleotide characterization. There is a lot of long-term potential in this area, given demand for stability, quality and impurity analysis.\nThe characterization of biologics and novel modalities allows these molecules to move downstream into routine QA/QC workflows. Additionally, at TA, we have added new powder rheology capabilities to our portfolio. This is to support the strong growth we are seeing in battery-related applications.\nOrders are critical to anode and cathode manufacturing, allowing battery producers to better screen electrode coatings and solvent-free dry coatings helps ensures optimal performance, prevent defects and reduce cell failure rates.\nAccording to industry sources, in the next 10 years, production of lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow tenfold. Demand is expected to exceed 4,000 gigawatt hours per year by 2022, driven by electric vehicles and energy storage. As battery volume scale, our TA instrument portfolio is well positioned to support an expanding set of testing demands within the battery development and safety analysis space.\nOne of our European customers, the fast-growing Scandinavian battery producer, uses our rheometers to test incoming materials for critical electrode components. This company has tripled its purchases of TA instruments this year, reflecting not only its own growth, but the confidence they have in our technology and support as they scale their operations.\nI would now like to share some of the recent progress we've made in our -- towards the high-growth adjacencies as our third key message. Since time is limited, I will only focus on Bioprocess Characterization.\nBioAccord offers a compelling value proposition to bioprocess engineers. It provides a paradigm shift in analytical capabilities for biologics manufacturing, which while being quick and easy to use. Through our collaboration with Sartorius, we've expanded the capabilities of BioAccord in this area. We can dramatically shorten clone selection times.\nWe are also enabling improvements in tighter and yields, which can reduce COGS. Our value proposition is resonating amongst industry leaders. At the recent Bioprocess International Conference in Boston, which I attended per study, AstraZeneca publicly highlighted the benefits of implementing online process analytical technology using the BioAccord monitoring to monitor drug substance and cell culture media.\nMeanwhile, Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies are already using it to monitor vital components during cell culture production and for analysis of raw materials used in bioprocessing. By finger printing components in cell culture media using BioAccord, they are generating insights that can help streamline the manufacturing process. These are just a few of the early proof points we can share with you today for BioAccord. We're encouraged by the long-term opportunity we have to solve unmet needs in Bioprocess Characterization.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3 with 15% constant currency growth. Waters Division grew 14% and TA grew 18%. By end market, pharma grew 9%, industrial grew 22% and academic and government grew 29%.\nIn pharma, we saw growth in both large and small molecule with strength across segments, applications and regions. In industrial, each of our major regions grew mid-teens or above, with China up almost 30%, Europe up over 20% and U.S. growing 16%. Growth was led by LC-MS instrument sales, which grew 50% with our chemical analysis, food and environmental businesses, all delivering strong growth. In academic and government, growth was also strong across all regions.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia grew 18%. The Americas grew 11% and Europe grew 14%. In Asia, growth was led by China, where sales grew 23% as we executed well across all trade classes despite the challenges posed by new lockdowns.\nIn the Americas, the U.S. grew 11% with growth across applications and end markets. Europe grew 14% in the quarter, led by industrial, which grew over 20% and pharma, which grew low double digits. By products and services, instruments grew 21% with our LC-MS and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Recurring revenues grew 10% with chemistry up 10% and service up 9%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year's quarter.\nFinally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis and rheology. Demand for TA products remained strong across all regions with sales in electronics and batteries continuing to ramp. Gross margin for the quarter was 56.7% compared to 58.9% in the third quarter of 2021.\nWe had incredible growth in instrument sales this quarter with mass spec growing nearly 40%. While this resulted in approximately 40 basis points of adverse mix impact for the quarter, it is expected to drive future margin accretive recurring revenue growth. The strong U.S. dollar resulted in 120 basis points of FX headwind on gross margin in the quarter.\nWe have continued to offset the impact of inflation with pricing increases. Working with our customers, our teams delivered over 350 basis points of net pricing gains in the quarter. While inflation had no net impact on our gross profit dollars, it does affect margin calculation as the revenue base is also higher. These dynamics drove the remaining difference in the year-over-year gross margin for the quarter. But again, there was no net impact of inflation on gross profit dollars or earnings per share as the incremental inflationary costs were offset by pricing increases.\nOperating margin for the quarter was approximately 27.8% compared to 29.7% in the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds and the gross margin dynamics. Year-to-date, operating margins have expanded 70 basis points before 110 basis points of foreign exchange headwind.\nThe expansion of 70 basis points includes the investments we have been making to nurture our higher growth adjacencies and includes the impact of higher instrument mix and the inflation dynamics I just discussed. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%. Average share count came in at 60.1 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the third quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter was $2.64 in comparison to $2.66 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 13%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.60. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the third quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $126 million after funding $32 million of capital expenditures.\nSince last quarter, accounts receivables have moved back in line with historical pattern relative to our sales volume. However, we continue to build inventory as a proactive measure to secure supply and build safety stock, given strong instrument demand.\nIn the third quarter, our inventory balance increased by $32 million. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out attractive, high-growth adjacent markets. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 483,000 shares of our common stock for $155 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1.\nNow as we look ahead to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022. We have seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across all our geographies and new product introductions, which are driving growth.\nAs we close the year, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance. We also expect to successfully navigate supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures assuming these challenges do not worsen.\nIn light of this continued strong performance, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance to 11.5% to 12% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 9.5% to 10.5%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points resulting in a full year reported sales growth guidance of 5.5% to 6%.\nGross margin for the full year is expected to be nearly 58%, and includes 100 basis points of FX headwinds versus prior year. Operating margin is expected to be 30.2%, which includes 120 basis points of underlying margin expansion, offset by 120 basis points of FX headwind.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $38 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.3 million. Our share repurchase program will continue as we progress through the rest of the year, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\nRolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.85 to $11.95, which is 6% to 7% growth versus last year despite a negative currency impact of approximately 11 percentage points. Versus the previous guide, our updated guidance includes improved underlying business performance of $0.14, offset by $0.24 of higher FX headwind.\nAt current FX rates, we estimate the full year FX impact on 2023 to be a year-over-year headwind of 2% to 3% on sales, and 4% to 5% on adjusted EPS. FX impact is expected to be largely concentrated in the first half of 2023 at current rates.\nLooking to the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 8 percentage points, resulting in a fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance of minus 2% to 0%.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.66 to $3.76, which is flat to 3% higher than prior year's quarter despite negative currency impact of approximately 15 percentage points.\nNow I would like to turn it to Udit for summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance. Demand has continued to be robust across our resilient end markets and geographies. This, together with our strong commercial execution and refreshed portfolio is allowing us to consistently deliver excellent results. Once again, we are raising our full year sales guidance from a prior range of 9.5% to 10.5%, now to 11.5% to 12%.\nIn closing, I would like to point out that our 2022 ESG report will be released next week. At Waters, we're proud to have been widely recognized as an ESG leader. We believe that we all have a part to play in leaving the world better than we found it from decreasing our environmental footprint to becoming more representative of the society we live in.\nThis year, we made further progress towards our goals, delivering approximately 60% of our electricity from renewable or low-carbon sources. We launched the Water Student Academy and our partnering with 3 historically black colleges and universities to provide STEM education and career opportunities. We also conducted broad stakeholder engagement in our comprehensive materiality assessment.\nWe are proud that our new state-of-the-art chemical manufacturing facility in Taunton, Massachusetts was recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council as the only LEED-certified facility of its kind in the state and among the small number in the United States. While there is always more work to be done in ESG, I'm proud of the progress we've made.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded.(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2021, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended April 2, 2022, in Part 1a under the caption Risk Factors, both of which are on file with the SEC as well as the cautionary language included in this morning's press release.\nWe further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law.\nDuring today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation which are available on the company's website.\nIn our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation.\nUnless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe second quarter, we continued to deliver excellent results led by instrument growth of 12%, with continued broad-based strength across our end markets and geographies.\nI would like to take a moment to again acknowledge the unwavering efforts of our teams who have persistently worked through the challenging environment to deliver for our customers. We saw this with our China team, whose dedication and agility through the lockdowns in Shanghai drove exceptional results again this quarter which came ahead of our expectations. But importantly, we've seen this commitment across all our teams and regions and it truly reflects the indomitable spirit we have here at Waters.\nTurning now to Slide 3. We have 3 messages. Our strong commercial momentum is driving great results in end markets that remain healthy. This is reflected in the broad, sustained growth we are delivering across our products, geographies and end markets. Customer demand remains robust with orders that -- again outpacing sales as our strong momentum continued with double-digit sales growth again in the second quarter.\nInnovation is contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refreshed product portfolio is highly competitive and providing key benefits to our customers which is, again, driving strong adoption of these new products as well as market share gains. Over time, we expect that the strong instrument placements and resulting expansion in our installed base will drive growth in recurring revenue tied to these instruments.\nAnd thirdly, we have a robust business model serving an attractive and resilient base. Waters serves end markets with sustainable growth drivers that are linked to key demographic areas, such as (inaudible) count population growth and increasing regulatory requirements around testing.\nWith our strong business model, we have growth levers that exist throughout the market cycle across instruments, service, chemistry and informatics. Growth in one of these areas usually results in follow-through performance across our business model, and you can see this today with our strong pull-through of instrument sales into higher attachment rates, which is again driving recurring revenue growth.\nNow moving on to Slide 4. In the second quarter, our revenue grew 5% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis with broad strength across our end markets and geographies as well as in both instruments and recurring revenues. Orders in the quarter exceeded sales of USD 714 million as we continued to see very strong demand from our customers.\nOur Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.75, up 6% year-over-year despite FX headwinds. The impact of FX headwind lowered our non-GAAP earnings per share growth by 11% versus the prior quarter. Amol will cover the impact of FX in more detail later in the call.\nNow looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency. First, by operating segment, Waters division grew 10%, while TA grew 12%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 10%; industrial grew 8%; and academic and government grew 16%.\nIn pharma, we saw continued broad-based strength across segments, geographies and applications with, growth in large molecule and small molecule applications. Growth was led by the U.S., which grew mid-teens with large molecule applications growing twice the rate of small molecule applications; China, which grew in mid-teens; and India, which grew 12%.\nIn industrial, growth was driven by the U.S., up mid-teens; Europe, up high single digits; and India, which grew over 50%.\nOur food and environmental business is performing well with PFAS testing also positively impacting growth.\nIn academic and government, after seeing a slower recovery than our other end markets last year, customer spending continued to be more active during the quarter with mid-teens growth for the quarter, led by strength in China, India and the Americas.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia grew 9%, the Americas grew 15% and Europe grew 7%. In Asia, growth was led by China, where sales grew 9% despite the presence of COVID-related lockdowns for much of the quarter. Customer demand in China remained strong and we're observing great activity levels which rapidly picked up in June relative to April and May when the lockdowns were in effect. Meanwhile, sales in India grew 24%. The Americas was again our fastest-growing region, with the U.S. growing 14%, which was led by strong instrument sales, which grew 20% along with recurring revenues, which grew 11%. In Europe, the growth was led by pharma and industrial, which both grew high single digits.\nBy products and services, instruments grew 12%, with our LC mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Recurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry up 9%, and service up 8%.\nNew products again contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter with unit sales of Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier more than doubling versus the second quarter of last year. Unit sales of MaxPeak Premier Columns also more than doubled and have continued to add strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, driven by large molecule applications.\nIn mass spec, we saw strength across our portfolio, including for our Xevo TQ-XS and Cyclic IMS instruments as well as strong traction for our newly launched Xevo TQ Absolute, which sold out at launch and has already developed a backlog. Customers are seeing the value that TQ Absolute provides in application areas such as food safety and pharma development in small and large molecules -- small molecule applications given its dramatic leap in performance and efficiency compared with other instruments in its class.\nHere in New England, one state public health laboratory was the first to purchase and installed a TQ Absolute for the express purpose of PFAS testing in water and environmental samples. That customer told us that TQ Absolute is giving them a 100 to 400-fold increase in sensitivity versus their prior instrument while being far easier to use in terms of sample prep and in quickly giving them highly accurate results.\nMeanwhile, at the high end, we're seeing good demand for our Cyclic ion mobility technology. One example is researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas who are using it for precision molecular profiling within OMEX research. We're getting feedback that it is enabling significant progress in discovering and validating novel blood and plasma biomarkers for early disease detection in oncology.\nFinally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 12%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong across all regions, led by electronics and batteries.\nNow moving to Slide 6. I would like to reflect on the excellent strength and momentum we have sustained in the first half of the year driven by our commercial execution, product innovation and pricing offsetting inflation, leading to these great results.\nSo far this year, instruments have grown almost 20%, with recurring revenue up just under 10% against strong stacked comps last year. In the U.S., instruments have grown over 35% year-to-date. All our regions have seen growth, led by Americas, which has grown 20 years -- 20% year-to-date. Meanwhile, China has grown low teens despite the COVID-related lockdowns, which we were able to successfully navigate through in both the first and second quarters of 2022.\nEach of our end markets have seen double-digit growth, which speaks to our broad execution across regions and segments. Meanwhile, we continue to observe strong demand from our customers and are seeing ongoing positive impacts from our market plus growth initiatives.\nNow turning to Slide 7. By each of these initiatives continue to progress, the 3 areas I would like to highlight this quarter are service attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch excellence.\nFirst, with service attachment, we're seeing strong pull-through of our instrument sales into service plan coverage which has driven our attachment rates over 100 basis points higher so far this year which is ahead of our expectations and builds on excellent results last year. The progress we're making with service underscores the opportunity ahead to grow our recurring revenues which layers on top of our instrument growth.\nSecond, also part of our recurring revenues, e-commerce adoption of chemistry has continued to move higher which is having a positive effect on sales by making it easier for our customers to do business with us and driving incremental growth opportunities. 31% of our chemistry is now sold through digital channels, which is a 10-point increase compared to 2019 when the initiative began, and we see further runway to over 50% in the long term. Since we started the initiative in 2019, revenue from digital sales has more than doubled. And in the first half of this year, it grew over 30% versus the first half of 2021.\nThird, our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth as demand has scaled up for Arc HPLC, for ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier Columns. Our product vitality index has grown 300 basis points versus the second quarter of last year to 15% as sales of these products have quickly ramped, with launch excellence and the impact of innovation driving strong market uptake.\nAs I've shared before, ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large molecules. This technology is capturing growth opportunities as pharma customers seek to expand their capacity and build capabilities for biologics and novel modalities, such as oligonucleotides, mRNA and peptides. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to refresh and expand their capital equipment with Arc HPLC.\nNow on Slide 8. In June, at ASMS, we announced our new Xevo G3 high-resolution mass spec. The G3 is our latest generation benchtop Q-TOF and it provides increased sensitivity and range for large molecule analysis over its predecessor, the G2, which is one of our best-selling high-res mass spec products. This instrument is described by our customers as an analytical workhorse given that it offers the power and range needed to characterize complex biotherapeutics while also providing the reliability, robustness and reproducibility needed in late-stage development. As biologics and novel modalities increasingly move into later stages, this instrument supports the associated workflows by allowing more detailed characterization of these molecules in product and process development. This occurs before they move downstream into higher volume manufacturing QA/QC where routine analysis will then be performed on instruments such as BioAccord.\nA further key piece of innovation is the software we've developed on waters_connect which allows the compliant workflows developed on the G3 to seamlessly transition to BioAccord with just a few mouse clicks. This ease of transfer had been unheard of before now and it allows our customers to transfer data between instruments and global locations within their enterprise network, all while remaining in an industry compliance setting.\nOn waters_connect, our latest apps are enabling exciting new analytical areas for the G3 and BioAccord, including cell culture media analysis and peptide analysis with in-depth protein and glycan profiling. Most recently, we've added the ability to characterize oligonucleotides and conduct impurity analysis as well as perform lipid nanoparticle compositional analysis and stability testing which is highly relevant for mRNA molecules. These are all new analytical areas in large molecule characterization where there is a lot of long-term potential as the market looks for more advanced characterization capabilities for biologics and novel modalities. As we continue to innovate and expand our offering, we are increasingly well positioned to support biologics and novel modalities as they move downstream into routine analysis.\nNow I'd like to pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. Udit already covered the breakdown of our sales growth for the quarter, so I will now cover the remaining elements of our non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year.\nGross margin for the quarter was 57% compared to 58.9% in the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar as well as higher instrument mix.\nPricing for the quarter was over 300 basis points, successfully offsetting the impact of material and freight inflation. Operating margin for the quarter was 28.4% compared to 29.2% in the second quarter of 2021. This represents 70 basis points of margin expansion in constant currency before 150 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. For the first half of the year, operating margins have expanded 120 basis points before 80 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%. Average share count came in at 60.5 million shares, which is about 1.6 million less than the second quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 6% to $2.75 in comparison to $2.60 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our EPS growth by 11%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.72 compared to $2.69 last year.\nA reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $67 million after funding $39 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $11 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a $38 million tax reform payment.\nOur free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by our proactive measures to secure supply and rebuild safety stock, resulting in a $40 million increase in inventory before exchange rates.\nAdditionally, timing of shipments and installations, particularly in China, resulted in an 8-day increase of DSO to 81 days and an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $60 million before FX. We expect these dynamics to correct in the second half of the year as we have already observed an increase in collections in July. For the full year, we anticipate being close to our historical free cash flow conversion levels.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out, attractive, high-growth, adjacent markets.\nIn Q2, we repurchased approximately 479,000 shares of our common stock for $152 million.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1.\nNow as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 10. We've seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across all our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect our solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives and innovation will provide a lasting contribution to our performance. We also expect to continue to successfully address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, assuming these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year.\nThese dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 9.5% to 10.5% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 7.5% to 9%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 5 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%.\nGross margin for the full year is expected to be about 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5% as our resilient business momentum is able to mitigate the impact from exchange rates.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%.\nAverage diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.4 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into the year and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate.\nNow rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.95 to $12.05, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 9 percentage points. Currency impact is $0.56 incrementally more worse than our previous guide. However, our stronger-than-expected results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the currency headwind.\nLooking to the third quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 8% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%.\nThird quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 10 percentage points.\nNow I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, we are pleased with our sustained broad strength for the quarter which was driven by our strong commercial execution and the impact of innovation in our highly competitive refreshed product portfolio. Demand has remained strong across our end markets as we've continued to capture growth opportunities in both large and small molecule applications, food and environmental testing and battery material analysis, which each have long-term durable growth opportunities that we're well positioned for. To reflect our strength, we're raising our full year constant currency sales growth from -- sales growth guidance from 7.5% to 9% to 9.5% to 10.5%.\nMeanwhile, we have delivered great operating results despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. And for EPS, our strong results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the impact of foreign exchange headwinds.\nWith that, we will now begin the Q&A session.

(Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManager of IR, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release, including with respect to risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law.\nDuring today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nIn addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We had a record start to the year with first quarter sales led by instruments, which grew over 25% with a broad-based strong performance across all our end markets and geographies.\nBefore summarizing the quarter, let me start by saying how extremely proud I am of our teams who've worked tirelessly to manage our supply chain, delivering operational excellence and exceptional support for our customers through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. It is a result of the indomitable spirit of all my colleagues at Waters. I will now provide a brief overview of our first quarter operating results and deliver our key messages. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.\nTurning now to Slide 3. We have 3 key messages. First, we had a very good start to 2022 with great traction for our new instrument products, strong operational performance and sustained commercial momentum. Demand has remained robust across all our end markets. Second, we're laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make great progress in executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives positively impacting our results. We have a revitalized portfolio with innovation that is answering the needs of our customers in both large and small molecule workflows as well as our non -- as well as in our nonpharma markets such as food testing, environmental and material science. And thirdly, Waters has a firm commitment to leave the world better than we found it. We are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG programs.\nNow moving to Slide 4. In the first quarter, our revenue grew 13% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad growth across all our end markets and geographies. Orders in the quarter exceeded our sales of $691 million, reflecting a very strong demand. Instruments grew at 26% in constant currency, with strong growth across our LC mass spec and TA portfolios. New products contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter, with unit sales of Arc, HPLC and Acuity Premier more than tripling versus the first quarter of last year. In mass spec new instruments in our high-end tandem quad portfolio, such as our Xevo TQ-XS also saw strong growth in both industrial and pharmaceutical applications.\nInstrument strength is a positive indicator for future growth of our consumables and service revenues. Recurring revenues grew 9% for the quarter with chemistry up 8% and service up 9%. This quarter had one fewer day than the first quarter of 2021, which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Without that, recurring revenues would have also grown double digits.\nOur MAX peak premier columns have continued to strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, given the benefit this technology provides for novel modality applications and our increased exposure to biologics. Meanwhile, we're seeing increased service plan attachment rates in our key regions at instrument point of sale. By geography, growth was led by the Americas, with the U.S. up 28%, driven by broad performance in each of our end markets. In China, sales grew 17% with pharma, industrial and academic and government, all up double digits.\nAs lockdowns in certain regions persist, we're beginning to see more of an impact to our business, but we're in close contact with our customers and demand remains robust. Once the lockdowns ease, we expect activity levels to catch up that normalize with limited impact to our full year growth expectations for China. However, we anticipate some sales impact in the second quarter if customer access continues to be constrained.\nOur Q1 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.80, up 22% year-over-year, driven by sales growth, volume leverage and an ability to manage inflation through pricing. Given the global nature of our business, we're seeing ongoing supply constraints and inflationary pressures. Despite this, we have been successful in working through these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers while delivering good operating results.\nTurning now to Slide 5. While each of our initiatives continues to progress. The 2 areas I would like to highlight this quarter are contract organizations and launch excellence. For contract organizations, our unique technical abilities and ability to collaborate closely with our customers are resulting in market share gains and strong revenue growth. Revenues from these customers were up over 25% for this quarter lead by over 50% growth in China.\nTurning now to launch excellence. Our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth with demand, ramping for Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier, and MAX premier columns. ACQUITY Premier and MAX Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large, complex molecules. Our customers are using the technology for oligonucleotide analysis as well as separation and purification of novel modalities such as mRNA, peptides and glycans, just to name a few examples. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to purchase new capital equipment, including Arc HPLC.\nNow on Slide 6. We recently launched the Xevo TQ Absolute, which is up to 15x more sensitive when analyzing negatively Ionized compounds compared to other tandem quads currently on the market, while also using less sample. It is designed to help pharmaceutical, food and environmental labs, meet regulations requiring trace-level quantitative mass spec analysis for a broad set of applications.\nIn food testing, the instrument takes detection of anionic pesticides and their metabolites to a new level of quantitation. In pharma, it can provide highly sensitive analysis for oligonucleotides and peptide bioanalysis as well as quantification of estrogens in clinical research, uses for which high-resolution mass spec have typically been required. The instrument is highly efficient, using approximately 50% less electricity and gas and also producing 50% less heat than other high-performance standard quads in the market, both of which reduce the carbon footprint of analytical labs.\nIt is also 50% smaller than other instruments in its class, which also adds value to our customers as space and analytical labs is limited and costly. Our tandem quad portfolio was stronger than ever and together with Waters Connect, we're able to make customers' workflows easier, faster and more efficient without compromising performance.\nNow on Slide 7. Immerse Delaware, our second innovation and Research Lab will be opening tomorrow part of a multiyear collaboration with the University of Delaware. Its purpose is to develop analytical solutions to better characterize the manufacturing process for biologicals and novel modalities, which will support our path into bioprocess characterization. Researchers from both Waters and the University of Delaware will develop solutions, including sensor and instrument improvements, data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to drive improvements in quality, yield and efficiency as well as characterize critical quality attributes that will be a key step towards separating the process from the product and biologics.\nOn Slide 8, we are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG activities, which continue to be recognized in a number of areas. Earlier this year, we achieved a score of 100 on the 2022 Corporate Equality Index earning Waters in designation as one of the best basis to work for LGBTQ+ equality. In addition, Barron's ranked Waters #6 on its 100 most sustainable U.S. companies list for 2022 based on a set of 230 performance indicators and reflects our efforts of continuous improvement in social and environmental responsibility. On the list, we were the highest placed company in the health care sector and in the Life Science tools segment.\nRecently, within our diversity and inclusion and STEM education efforts, Waters has partnered with 3 historically black colleges and universities to create STEM opportunities for students through funding, instrument donations, mentoring and the awarding of scholarships to students exploring the analytical sciences. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and the results in revenue growth and operational performance, which are demonstrating our continued success in our focus areas of execution, innovation and growth.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the first quarter financials as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $691 million in the first quarter, an increase of 16% in constant currency and an increase of 13% as reported. Looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 9, in constant currency, first by operating segment. Waters Division grew 16%, while TA grew by 18%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 19%. Industrial grew 17% and academic and government grew 4%.\nIn Pharma, we saw broad-based strength across segments, geographies and applications and in both large molecule and small molecule. Growth was led by the U.S., which was up over 35%. India, up just under 30%; and China, which grew mid-teens. In Industrial, our performance was also strong across all major geographies, with U.S., Europe and China all growing 20% or above.\nTurning to academic and government. We saw a similar trend to last quarter with mid-single-digit growth as customer spending has become more active, led by China and the U.S. Now by geography, sales in Asia were up 14%, with China up 17%. The Americas grew 26% with the U.S. up 28%. And Europe grew 9%. In China, we saw broad performance across all our end markets, which grew each up double digits. In the U.S., growth towards broad-based led by Pharma, which was up almost 40%; and industrial, which grew over 20%.\nGrowth was very strong in both instrument sales, which grew almost 60% and recurring revenues, which grew in the mid-teens. In Europe, growth was led by Industrial, which grew 20% and driven by strong growth in food and environmental. Sales of LC and MS instruments to pharma customers grew high teens as strong capital purchasing patterns continued on from last year.\nUdit already covered our growth by products and services, where instruments grew 26% for the quarter, chemistry grew 8% and service grew 9%, driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for our TA products continue to be strong in all regions, with growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals, including batteries and sustainable polymers.\nNow I would like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points to 58.6% and despite higher instrument mix, inflation pressures and stronger U.S. dollar. This was driven by volume leverage and pricing.\nOperating margin for the quarter increased by 170 basis points to 30.3%, driven by volume leverage on operating expenses. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%. Our average share count came in at 61 million shares which is about 1.7 million less than the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 22% to $2.80 in comparison to $2.29 last year.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.62 compared to $2.37 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2022, free cash flow was about 25% of sales at $176 million after funding $28 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $6 million relating to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations.\nIn the first quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 81 days, down 3 days compared to first quarter of last year. Given higher sales volume and our proactive measures to secure supply, including building some electronic component safety stock, Inventory increased by approximately $54 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out attractive, high market, high-growth adjusting opportunity. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 493,000 shares of our common stock for $160 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $941 million with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.9%.\nNow as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022, which is on Slide 10. We've had a strong start to the year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. We also expect that we will be able to continue to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, and these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year. These dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 7.5% to 9% constant currency sales growth, up from our initial guide in February of 5% to 7%.\nAt current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58.5% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.6 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022, and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, we are raising our full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share guidance to the range of $11.90 to $12.10. This includes negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points or $0.45 at current rates.\nLooking at the second quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points, resulting in second quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%. Given the ongoing lockdowns in China, we anticipate a headwind of approximately 100 to 200 basis points to our growth for the second quarter, assuming lockdowns do not worsen, which is factored in our second quarter guidance.\nSecond quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 5 percentage points or $0.13 at current rates. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, our teams continue to deliver excellent results despite the challenging environment with strong instrument growth and great traction for our new instrument products. We are laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make progress executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives delivering positively and contributing positively to our results.\nWith that, we will now begin the Q&A session.

Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe've ended a very successful year at Waters. In end-markets with sustainable growth drivers, we have revived our resilient business, and are now focused on growing our portfolio. Despite higher comparables, we saw strong growth continue with an acceleration on a stacked basis as the year went on. The strength we've seen in our instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for the future as our new products have gained traction, and this all supports the sustainable future growth we expect to see in our consumables and service.\nBefore summarizing the quarter and full year, let me start by thanking my colleagues around the globe who represented the indomitable spirit of Waters throughout 2021. We remain focused on supporting our customers and delivering exciting new products despite the challenging conditions of the pandemic. Achieving these results in a normal year would have been quite an accomplishment, but to do so while balancing the continued ups and downs of the pandemic with a major transformation and a new leadership team is indeed quite remarkable.\nNow I'm turning to Slide 3. We have 3 messages. We have a resilient and attractive portfolio of instrument systems, chemistry, consumables and services in end-markets that are supported by sustainable growth drivers. We've revitalized this core by engaging our customers progressing on a number of growth initiatives and continuing to innovate across our portfolio while launching exciting new products. And now we're focused on growth of our core business as well as accessing high-volume applications and faster billing adjacencies.\nI will now provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as commentary on our end-markets geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone line to take your questions.\nMoving on to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, our revenue grew 6% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad strength across our end-markets and geographies with double-digit year-end demand for our instruments and continued growth in our recurring revenue products. This translates to a 7.5% 2-year stacked CAGR for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue grew 18% as reported and 16% in constant currency as we saw strong growth in 2021 across all our regions led by pharma and industrial end-markets This translates to a 7% 2-year stacked CAGR for the year versus 2019 in constant currency.\nOur Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.67 per share, up 1% year-on-year and 7% stacked. Excluding the effect of our prior year COVID cost actions and FX, EPS grew 8% versus last. For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $11.20, and 12% on a 2-year stacked basis.\nNow looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5. In constant currency, first by operating segment. The Waters division grew 7%, while TA grew 16%. By end-market our largest market category: pharma, grew 8%; industrial, grew 7%; and academic and government grew at 5%. In pharma, we saw continued broad-based strength in sales across segments, geographies and applications. Biopharma and contract organizations grew well above 20%.\nIn industrial, growth was led by our TA business, which saw strong global strength in thermal as well as microcalorimetry and biology. Within the Waters Division, we saw broad demand for LC instruments across our geographies as well as our customers -- as well as our customer segments who continue to invest in new capital equipment. Turning to academic and government. We saw an improvement with growth across most of our geographies into the year-end. We're actively revitalizing our relationships with KOLs, which is an integral part of achieving long-term success in academic and government. While it takes some time for us to regain traction, Waters has familiarity and a fan base amongst KOLs who have often used instruments throughout their careers.\nJust last week, I was talking with the head of a leading core lab at one of our -- one of the top medical institutions in the United States. He's worked closely with Waters for the better part of 2 decades to build our proteomics capabilities at this institution and currently has over Waters LCs and 20 mass spec instruments from our company.\nMoving now to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 9%, with China up 13%, Americas, 8%, with U.S., up 8%; and Europe grew 5%. In China, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter, with growth led by contractors, biopharma and a strong recovery in clinical. We also saw strong growth in food testing and chemical assays. In the U.S., growth came from ongoing strength in our pharma and industrial end-markets In pharma, sales were strong in LC and mass spec, which combined grew in the mid-teens with chemistry up low double digits. In industrial, our TA business saw strong instrument placement across applications, led by advanced materials, chemicals and battery testing.\nIn Europe, all end-markets continued to grow, led by pharma and industrial with food and environmental businesses, resulting in strong demand for our tandem quads. Meanwhile, pharma sales remained solid with growth led by large molecule applications. By product and services, customer demand for our instruments finished the year strong, continuing the trend of instrument growth that we saw throughout the year while demand for recurring revenue products remained strong. Overall, instrument sales grew 12% for the quarter with a robust demand driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution.\nIn LC, Arc HPLC continued to see strong global growth in our core segments as demand continues to ramp. Meanwhile, our ACQUITY and Arc Premier Instruments continue to see strong adoption, driven by applications in large molecule and novel modalities such as mRNA. In mass spec, we saw growth in our high-end tandem quad portfolio led by Xevo TQ-XS, Xevo TQ -- and Xevo TQ-S micro. We also saw strong demand from our biopharma and CRO customers as well as for food safety applications. In our high-res mass spec portfolio, we saw the demand for cyclic with drug discovery applications. We're also encouraged by the early adoption of our new SELECT SERIES MRT time-of-flight platform with customers using it for biopharma, discovery and OMEX applications.\nFor recurring revenues, despite the quarter having 6 fewer days than the fourth quarter of 2020, chemistry sales grew 5%, led by continued high utilization by our pharma customers. Our new MaxPeak premier columns continue to provide incremental growth for our chemistry business. This technology provides important benefits in separation and purification of mRNA, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans, which is effectively answering the needs of our customers as they work with more complex molecules. Service grew 2% despite a tough double-digit comparison a year ago, with strong growth in both China and in India, which has been a theme throughout the year.\nFinally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 16%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and biology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong in all regions with growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals, including batteries and electronics.\nLooking now at our top line results for the full year on Slide 6. In constant currency, the Waters Division grew 15%, while TA grew 25%. By end-market, pharma grew 19% and industrial grew 15%, while academic and government came at 5% for the year. Pharma, which is our largest market, has grown 10% on a 2-year stack basis driven by strong demand in our instruments and recurring revenues with strength in both large and small molecule applications. We've also seen ongoing strength in our industrial and applied market, which has grown 6% on a 2-year stack basis, led by China as well as North America and Europe.\nIn academic and government, which has been our slowest market to recover, sales in Europe and the U.S. are close to pre-pandemic levels, while China has further in its recovery as university spending continues to be constrained. By geography: Asia grew 19%, China growing 25%, Americas grew at 16%, with the U.S. growing at 14%, and Europe also grew 14%. For the full year, on a 2-year stack basis, our 3 largest geographies, the U.S., China and Europe grew 6%, 7% and 8%, respectively.\nWhat is especially pleasing is that the demand is balanced across all geographies, including a robust recovery in the U.S. By products and services, instruments grew 23% for the year, chemistry 15% and service grew 9%. On a stacked basis, instruments grew 6%, chemistry, 9% and service 6%, showing strong performance above our historical averages. The strength we've seen in our LC instrument portfolio throughout the year remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables as well as service. Our growth in recurring revenues has also been supported by the progress we've made in e-commerce as well as delivering higher attachment rates and service.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we are certainly not immune to the ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we are proactively addressing these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers.\nNow moving on to Slide #7. We covered this in our Q3 earnings call, and also at the recent JPMorgan conference, our initiatives across instrument replacement, service attachment contract organizations, e-commerce and new product launch excellence have all been important components for us, regaining our momentum and delivering strong performance in 2021. We've continued to exceed expectations and milestones on these initiatives and believe that each has further runway not just in 2022, but in years beyond, providing an average incremental growth impact of roughly 100 basis points annually across the base business in the next 2 to 3 years as our transformation program is firmly on track.\nMoving now on to Slide 8. The strength of our business is being supported by instrument innovation with recent product launches that have revitalized our core. Waters continues to build on its robust base, deep customer relationships, and importantly, its highly technical team of scientists and engineers with deep understanding of our customers' problems to solve. For example, Arc HPLC, which was launched in 2020, allows customers to increase the performance and capabilities for their high-volume workhorse instruments without revalidating their existing methods. This is absolutely critical in compliant environments, and helps us provide the benefits of newer technology to our customers while ensuring backwards compatibility.\nMeanwhile, our MaxPeak premier technology provides important benefits and applications where sensitivity and reproducibility is key, by virtually eliminating the metal binding affinity of compounds like mRNAs, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans. On the instrument side, ACQUITY Premier is a UPLC that was custom designed for biologics and novel modality applications. providing 100x better detection sensitivity than non-Premier instruments and a 50% reduction in peak tailing. Within our chemistry portfolio, MaxPeak premier columns, which also offer this high-performance surface coatings, have set a record in terms of uptake for new columns as this technology continues to be well-received by our pharma customers.\nTurning to our mass spec portfolio. One additionally example of innovation is our SELECT SERIES MRT, which is our high resolution, multi-reflecting time-of-flight instrument that provides remarkable accuracy at high speed with outstanding clarity. This instrument is setting the benchmark in mass accuracy. Its high throughput is enabling large sample studies of proteins and metabolites, which previously would have taken too much time to conduct.\nAdditionally, you may have seen our announcement this morning of what is this acquisition of Charge Detection Mass Spec technology. CDMS. CDMS overcomes limitations of conventional mass spec in characterizing analyzing and quantifying complex large molecules. These investments will allow Waters to develop and commercialize CDMS technology to solve significant unmet needs in novel modality settings such as cell and gene therapy for drug development.\nWith the discipline, my colleagues, John Pratt and Jianqing Bennett have brought into launches, new products, have meaningfully grown in their contribution this year. And with our product vitality index, around 150 basis points -- up around 150 basis points to approximately 15% in Q4.\nTurning now to Slide 9. A key element of our informatics strategy is to provide customers with tools that help them better manage their workflows and achieve faster, easier results with high-quality compliant data. Last month, we extended our next-generation informatics platform, Waters Connect to our tandem quad mass spectrometers for core quantitation, starting with food testing. As any scientist who works in mass spec will tell you, current software across the industry is powerful, but designed to fit all purposes, and as a result, can be complicated and difficult to use. Our new software is built around the purpose and end-market application for which it is being used, delivering on our key principle of providing advanced technology that is fast, robust and easy to use.\nIt reduces review times by up to 50% compared to the current market-leading platform by allowing labs to meet their compliance and data integrity requirements. The overriding benefit here is that analysts can reduce review time to a minimum, which is one of the largest bottlenecks in the lab. Improving workflows for quantitative LC-MS and mass-spec data review is critical for our customers as it helps improve the throughput and efficacy.\nI spent time with our launch team last week, and the rollout has begun with food testing applications, and we plan to extend it to other applications in the near future.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Let me turn to the critical problems in higher growth adjacencies that we identified this year, and believe we can solve over time. First, in bio separations, we see an opportunity to take our chemistry expertise from small molecule separation and apply it to novel modalities and large molecule separation.\nDespite their rapid growth, there are significant challenges in characterizing and confirming the quality of these large complex molecules. Take mRNA as an example. The industry has a key unmet need of sustaining analytical control when measuring molecular integrity. Current practices for newer modalities like this are not as reproducible as desired because there is not enough precision.\nSo by advancing our biologic capabilities, we can unleash our chemistry expertise and our engineering expertise to better characterize and separate these molecules and then identify items such as process-related impurities and degradation that are critical in later-stage development and high-volume manufacturing. In this area, specifically, we're looking at bioseparation solutions for mRNA and other nucleic acids, proteins and lipid nanoparticles as well as viral vector gene therapies and vaccines, and adeno-associated viruses.\nSecond, in bioprocess characterization. One of the key differences in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing is that once you define the manufacturing process, you're effectively stuck with it and cannot optimize it without completely revalidating the process because it is tied for the drug master file. By providing analytical techniques that are powerful enough to characterize the product sufficiently, we believe that we can overcome this barrier and separate the process from the product. This is a significant need in the industry and has the potential to be a very attractive market.\nOur partnership with Sartorius is a key step in this journey. And as we bring the processing power of LC-MS applying the BioAccord in a workflow that is simple, powerful and fast and can be easily used on-site by bioprocess engineers. The third application is of LC-MS and diagnostics, where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection. We believe mass spec has a significant role to stay here, and they have already demonstrated a proof of concept with the U.K. government in characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus with excellent sensitivity and selectivity leading to a lower false positive rate than many other techniques.\nIn review, our strong fourth quarter results capped a very successful year for Waters with broad-based growth across our end-markets and geographies. We sustained our momentum with strong 2-year stack revenue growth throughout the year, with our transformation now embedded in how we operate. Our core business has been revitalized with growing contributions from innovative new products and initiatives. We are laser-focused on our commercial execution. The markets we serve remain in a healthy state, and our regions have rebounded solidly from pandemic lows.\nMeanwhile, we see opportunities in higher growth adjacencies that will raise our exposure to faster-growing market segments as we start to solve the critical problems we've identified over time.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and full year financials as well as our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2022. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $836 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency and an increase of 6% as reported. We had a record instrument sales this quarter, which increased 12% versus prior year, and 8% on a 2-year stack basis. Despite 6 fewer calendar days, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 3% for the quarter. Chemistry revenues were up 5% and service revenues were up 2%, both of which had tough comparisons in the prior year. The 6 fewer calendar days in the quarter translated to a growth headwind of approximately 6% for recurring revenue and approximately 3% for total revenue.\nFor the full year, sales grew by about 16% in constant currency and 18% as reported. Recurring revenues grew 11%, with chemistry up 15% and service up 9%, while instrument sales grew 23% driven by strong customer demand and new product introductions. Our 2-year stacked constant currency sales growth was 7.5% for Q4 and 7% for the second half of 2021 versus 6.5% for the first half. This acceleration underscores our good commercial momentum heading into 2022.\nLooking ahead, comparing 2022 to 2021, there is 1 fewer day in the first quarter, no change in the second or third quarters, and 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. Now I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter came in as expected at 58%. On a full year basis, gross margin was 58.5% compared to 57.4% in the prior year, with improvements driven primarily by volume leverage, and a 30 basis points tailwind from FX.\nMoving down the P&L for Q4, operating expenses increased by approximately 12% on a constant currency basis, and include an increase of approximately 7% due to the normalization of our prior year COVID-related cost actions. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18% higher in constant currency, and include an increase of 15% due to the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost actions.\nIn the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.4% and 13.8%, respectively. For the full year, our effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points due to a favorable change in our income mix by jurisdiction. Our average share count came in at 61.4 million shares, which is about $1.1 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $3.67 in comparison to $3.65 last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost actions, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.52 compared to $3.49 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was up 24% at $11.20 versus $9.05 in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $11.17 versus $8.36 a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by sales volume, partially offset by the normalization of our COVID-related cost action. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2021, free cash flow was $187 million after funding $45 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $9 million related to the investments in our Taunton precision chemistry operations, and $5 million in costs relating to onetime litigation settlement. For the full year, free cash flow was $675 million with approximately $0.24 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.\nIn the fourth quarter, accounts receivable DSOs came in at 66 days, down 4 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and down 5 days compared to the last quarter. Inventory DIO decreased by 9 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Given higher sales volumes, and our proactive measures to secure supply. Inventory increased by $52 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 448,000 shares of our common stock for $156 million in Q4. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $945 million with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1. Our capital deployment priorities are investing for growth, maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility, and returning capital to shareholders, along with focus on deploying capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities.\nNow as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2022, which is on Slide 11. In 2021, our momentum has progressively accelerated driven by robust end-market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we head into 2022, we expect our momentum to continue and that we will be able to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures and believe that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. These dynamics support full year 2022 guidance of 5% to 7% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30% to 30.5%.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 61 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022, and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.75 to $12. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 2 percentage points at today's rates.\nLooking at the first quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3 percentage points, resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at today's rates. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. In summary, we are pleased with our performance this year. Our core business is reenergized. Our transformation is on track, and we've built really good commercial momentum going into 2022. We're now laser-focused on our commercial execution and accelerating innovation through our portfolio while reaching higher growth, close adjacent markets.\nWith a new leadership team in place and our transformation well underway, we're also expanding our focus on environmental, social and governance topics. We've initiated a complete materiality assessment, which will allow us to look at areas where Waters can contribute, and ensuring we do our part to leave the world better than we found it. I look forward to sharing an update on this later this year. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?"

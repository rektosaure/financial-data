Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everyone. Well, we believe our third quarter demonstrated encouraging momentum, continuing our progress, moving upward against one of the most challenging environments of our time, wars, inflation and tariffs. Moving upward against the tide of seasonality. And upward emits the variability that always accompanies the late sum.\nThe quarter showed that the resilience of our markets the momentum of our program, the advantage of our strategy, making in the markets where we sell and of our structure, the flexibility provided by our 15 factories in the U.S. have driven us forward, and we believe it will serve us well for some time. As we proceed today, I'll start with the highlights for our quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets and on the path ahead and then Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials.\nMy thoughts regarding the past 3 months that without question or qualification, our results are once again encouraging, fortified by the progress along our run rates for both growth and improvement. It was another quarter of bearing witness to our building traction against the uncertainty and headwinds of today. You can see it in our -- third quarter sales, $1 billion. Third quarter sales of [ $1,190.8 ] billion were up 3.8% from the $1.147 billion recorded last year. Excluding $9 million in favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased by 3%. In this third quarter, was up sequentially over the second quarter results, again, against normal seasonality, and we believe it offers substantial evidence of ongoing momentum. The -- operating income margin was 23.4%. Now that includes 190 basis points from a recent legal settlement. So excluding that local at that legal item -- OI margin was 21.5%, down 50 basis points. [ 20 ] of which were due to unfavorable currency, but 21.5% is still at a strong level and represents the second highest third quarter ever despite the turbine.\nFor financial services, FINCO OI of $68.9 million was down from the $71.7 million last year. And a number that when combined with our ACO results resulted in a consolidated OI margin of 26.9%. EPS was $5.02. And or [ $4.71 ], excluding the $0.31 from the onetime legal benefit, representing the highest ever for a third quarter and overcoming a $0.09 impact from higher pension amortization costs. So those are the overall results, we think they're pretty good.\nNow let's take a view of the markets. During the third quarter, the overall repair market remained favorable, displaying a continuing need and a rising complexity. Miles -- keeps growing. People move even in difficult times and they're holding on to their vehicles longer, requiring more upkeep. The car park keeps aging. It's now averaging nearly 2.8 years. In other words, people need repairs with solid regularity and the range of vehicle models needing work just is expanding and the vehicles keep getting more complex every day. The ever-expanding array of drivetrain sophisticated motors, neural net worth of sensors, multiple systems, a melding of hardware and software to control a growing range of functions. It all marks the trajectory of modern vehicles. Its environment of constantly rising repair challenges. In short, it appears never had a more promising future. And you can see it in the industry metrics, spending on repairs up double digits.\nTech comps rising wages continuing their upward march and keeping with the increasing skill required to keep the world mobile. So the techs are cash rich, but they're also confidence poor. Certain of their value but uncertain about the environment. They still want new tools that make the work easier, but they remain reluctant to commit to paying for big-ticket items with long-term financing. But in turbulence, our strategy of pivoting toward faster payback items is taking hold and it's making engaged.\nAutomotive repair is a great business. essential to our society and always advancing. Snap-on is well positioned for success with our short supply chains and the ability to redirect manufacturing capitalizing opportunities and on challenges as they arrive -- as they arise.\nNow let's speak of the other side of vehicle repair where repair systems and information or the -- Group operates, repair shop owners and managers, no they have to upgrade to keep pace with increasing complexity and to keep driving productivity. Technicians need to wade through more possibilities than ever to find the right fix. And RS&I can put them right on target. With our innovative hardware and powerful software, proprietary database offerings. I will have offers faster, more accurate ways to navigate the thousands of repair procedures that confront tech and a modern shop. It's a changing market in which dealerships and independents need to have the equipment and the specialty tools for tackling the advanced vehicles rolling into their garages.\nAs we go forward, the momentum just keeps building. and you can see it in the RS&I V soles, for the critical industries. Now this is the area where we have the largest global footprint operating across geographies and in multiple currencies. -- the rapid fire policies out of Washington and the headwinds politically and economically across the globe have clouded the prospects. Many of the players have adopted a wait-and-see approach, wanting the dust to settle for tariffs and for various other arenas before charting of course, fearful that the wind will suddenly change again and leave them embarrassed or disadvantaged.\nBut despite the continuing reticence, our order book keeps growing. In fact, despite everything, customers have started to commit, and we saw a nice and very profitable growth in the quarter. Critical industries offer a great opportunity for our customized products that will drive productivity and those still attenuated, some of that potential is starting to shine through. So overall, our markets offer attractive opportunities. The ever-changing landscape does dampen some of the possibilities, but our operations again this quarter, enabled by our broad and innovative product line, our distinctive and meaningful brand and our committed, capable and battle-tested team displayed unmistakable momentum. Overcoming this certainty and taking advantage of abundant opportunity.\nThat's the market, let's talk about the groups. In C&I, third quarter sales reached $367.7 million, which compared to the $365.7 million of last year. The quarter's volume included $4.8 million of favorable currency translation and an organic sales decrease of 0.8%.\nFrom an earnings perspective, C&I's operating margin was 15.6%, a decrease year-over-year of 110 basis points with 30 basis points of that coming from unfavorable currency. Gross margins, gross margins were a robust 40.9%, down 30 basis points. But that fairness is pretty much explained by the unfavorable currency. And it's a level that clearly demonstrates our resistance to the impact of the tariffs. Results were in the group were mixed across the business units with the -- or organic sales decrease primarily due to reductions in the Asia Pacific business, reflecting the quick relocation of the supply chains away from that region. Gains in critical industries and in specialty torque were the offset.\nCritical entities, in particular, showing strengthening in the aviation, heavy-duty and natural resources sector are demonstrating that criticality can overcome the uncertainty of the changing trade policy, and we'll continue to do so. Precision torque also continues to be a spark. The appetite for accurate measurement continues to rise. When the cost of failure is high, even a slight deviation is a problem, our readers want them for our precision, our surgent production facility in -- stream, Illinois knows it is firsthand. And in the quarter, it launched the all new TAC-2 Torque and Angle Click branch. It's built for the task, securing essential components like hydraulic fittings on heavy-duty equipment and natural resources or agricultural applications, places where downtime in our moat area can be catastrophic.\nThe TAC 2 offers a fast charging cradles.making sure that the tool is always powered and at the ready without the weight and thickness of other tools that utilize for onboard batteries. The rent is also accompanied with electronic module that communicates the torque value actually applied, allowing confirmation that the proper spectrum achieved and providing documentation for later review. And finally, heavy-duty equipment contains considerable variation in fastener giants. Our new unit features a unique mechanism that accommodates over 200 different adapters, enabling the device to physically address a wide range of fasteners used across different pieces of equipment, it consolidates dozens of tools into 1 model, the TAC 2, a new level of flexibility, connectivity and ease of use and the customers.\nAlso with C&I is our power tools operation, which is -- which in the back half of the quarter, launched our in 14.4 volt to [ 380 Xtolong ] cordless radget. This baby has a tech right between the eyes. Manufacturing in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, it's in a league of its own, a best-in-class 80-foot pounds a torque and a best-in-class 13-inch neck, 50% longer than any other offering. I mean this tool reaches farther into tight areas, applying greater power at the point of work. Everybody is talking about it. It speeds up repair and it's already a hit million-dollar product.\nWell, that's C&I, critical industry is in torque leading the way forward, leveraging customer connections to solve the critical and navigating the turbulence in international markets.\nNow let's move to the sales. Volume up organically 1%, increased activity in the international network and slightly higher sales in the U.S. Notably, the volumes also up sequentially from the second an unusual pattern, we believe demonstrating that the group has momentum and continuing momentum going forward. The group's operating margin was a strong 21.7% up 10 basis points from 2024. And that was overcoming a 10 basis point impact from unfavorable currency.\nNow the third quarter is where we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC, as we call it. This year's event was our Orlando, nearly 9,000 people attended franchisees, yes, and of course, the Snap-on team. It was a weekend filled with hands-on training transaction interactions with our expansive product offers and some great fun. With a cavalcade of 155 buses, transferring the Snap-on crew to Disney's Hollywood studios to celebrate our 105th anniversary. It's quite a weekend.\nThe product expo floor was our largest effort ever, spanning 185,000 square feet, well over 3 football fields where our entire portfolio of products was on display and real work situations, a new feature this year. that enables enable franchisees to witness firsthand the Snap-on difference in solving typical repairs. It was another memorable SSC, one filled with integration, education great new products and friendships, reinforcing the unique and special bond we have with our franchisees. The atmosphere and the outlook of the franchisees was extremely confident and positive. I've talked to many of them since. And they left pumped. We're ready to hit the road and apply the lessons learned and the icing on the cake, SFC orders were up nicely, increasing over last year by mid-single digits.\nHundreds of new products were on display at the conference, new innovative offerings derived from our new innovating -- new innovative offerings derived from our customer connections. Insight we gain directly in a workplace, faster base products like our S67 150-millimeter stack at forged in the Milwaukee plant. You see a traditional unit can't easily install cylinder head bolts on 6.7-liter power stroke engines used on their -- the range of trucks from F-250 and above. That sophisticated power plant requires a precise 7-step working procedure that reaches nearly 300-foot pounds and here's the problem. A normal socket is quite challenged to handle such force and many have socket has been damaged trying to apply the power needed. On top of which, they're too big to avoid nearby obstacles, completing the job with the standard tools often requires component disassembly to clear the way. So our engineers acting on a customer connection designed a purpose-built socket, increasing the wall fitness by [ 32% ] to withstanding extreme force and reducing the height for a more compact device, creating more access and higher durability in the same package, Snap-on customer connection and innovation, making a difficult task easier, faster and safer. But Milwaukee did more. The plant just released the all new -- Ford hogering flyer. I know. But it's a real time saver, we remove urea oil and upholstery to access sensors, heating or cooling elements and wires located within the vehicle seats. See, we don't always realize -- but complexity is not just under the hood or in the drivetrain and it causes all over the chassis. The new flyers are built to remove and install high retention clips, keeping the seat cover type providing a factory of parents after repair and doing it with increased safety. The new tool makes it difficult, but everyday task quite simple, and I'll tell you, the reception has been -- and in our Alabama plant, the local engineers address the customer connection observed with text using a small number of using small pocket screw drivers to price small component part, separate terminal connectors or remove seals. Well, screw drivers are not meant for those jobs. It's quite unsafe. And can lead to some pretty nasty cuts.\nSo the Snap-on team developed a 3-peas pocket, spybar set, just over 5 inches long, small enough for those post quarter, but first quarter, but tough jobs. The bundle -- this bundle made that common, but difficult work, much easier and safer. It was a while the tech oversubscribed. It was really a brilliant view by the Elkmont guys.\nPowering tools, the Tools Group pivot quick pay back products from all over our American factories, made the group's quarter, big hits, continuing momentum, driving sequential growth and authoring the strong levels of third quarter profitability. We like the Tools Group performance in the quarter and innovative new products force the path.\nNow RS&I. Sales of $464.8 million in the third quarter were up as reported 10% with an organic improvement of 8.9%, 8.9%. Higher activity with OEM dealerships and increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products led the way. Operating earnings for RS&I of $141.2 million in the period included a benefit of $22 million from the legal settlement and compared to the $107.3 million in 2024. The operating margin for the quarter at RS&I was 30.4%, 25.6%, as adjusted to exclude the legal effect, still up 20 basis points from last year and overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency. Snap-on was marked by some strong performances in hardware and software. Sales of diagnostic repair information to repair shop owners and managers rose high single digits.\nThe new Triton handheld had a strong quarter, its brighter screen, enhanced labscope and powerful intelligent diagnostics, powered by billions of repair record make it popular with franchisees and increasingly essential for advanced tech. At the same time, our sales OEM dealerships grew by double digits. Snap-on is fast becoming the partner of choice for assisting automaker programs and at automaker programs aimed at supporting new models of recalls. And that operation turned in a -- what I would call at [ Anbester's ] performance in the quarter. We have great confidence in our RS&I business.\nBut our customers and industry partners share the same belief and was demonstrated as PC Magazine announced its steam 2025 Innovation Awards and People Choice Awards. Our -- was well representative with the represented whether the Apollos FastTrack Intelligent diagnostic platform the sum TAM aligner for every Duty trucks and Mitchell One's job views software, all recognized as winners in both designations.\nRS&I also captured single award for its diagnostic thermal imager, it's a BK-5700 Bristol and for its Pro-Cut X19 cordless rotor matching system as a mouthful. In fact, collectively, the corporation was honored with a total of [ 2510 ] awards across the 56 possible categories. We believe it's a true testament to our competitive advantage and product across the corporation. But back to our RS&I. We're quite positive about RS&I's possibilities with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves and the quarter supports that confidence. I mean 8.9% of organic growth with higher margins -- as and I go -- so those are the highlights of our quarter, progress against big volatility and uncertainty, against seasonality and against the variability of the third quarter.\nC&I, the power of our customized kits punching through cuts, through renaissance in critical industries withstanding the Asia Pacific supply chain disruption. Tools Group, great products, confident franchisees, strong sequential momentum, the pivot continue with traction. Profitability remaining strong. RS&I, organic sales up 8.9% strong gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent repair shops, great new and decorated products, both hardware and software, powered by our proprietary pair and diagnostic data, all enabling technicians to make complex repairs easier, and it showed the numbers. And the overall corporation sales up 3.8% as reported 3% organically. Gross margin, 15.9%, resilient and existent holding firm at times of unprecedented sourcing turbulence, OI percentage 23.4%, 21.5%, excluding the legal benefit, still very strong and among the highest ever for the third quarter. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results for the third quarter are summarized on Slide 6. And Net sales of [ $1.118 ] billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.8% from 2024 levels, reflecting a 3% organic sales gain and $9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sales in our automotive repair markets were up, led by the strength in our Repair Systems & Information Group, which included solid gains in OEM dealership and independent repair shop owners and managers as well as higher sales of diagnostic products for our franchise Amgen.\nWithin the industrial sector, our C&I group, sales to critical industry customers increased in the quarter, but those gains were more than offset by continued weakness in the export activities of our Asia Pacific operations. Consolidated gross margin of 50.9% improved sequentially from 50.5% in the second quarter and compared to 51.2% third quarter last year.\nThe year-over-year decline of 30 basis points primarily reflected 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. While Snap-on is relatively advantaged in the current tariff environment, generally manufacturing products in the markets where they are sold, our costs can be affected by trade policies. In the third quarter, the impact of tariffs was largely offset by the higher sales volumes and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives.\nWith respect to the unfavorable foreign currency effects similar to last quarter, although the lesser degree, Snap-on incurred negative transaction impacts associated with the year-over-year strengthening of the Swedish krona versus the euro and the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, Snap-on as factories in Sweden, serving both the C&I and the RS&I groups that export throughout Europe and into the United States as well as into emerging markets.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.5% compared to 29.2% last year. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included a $22 million benefit from the settlement of a legal matter. The 170 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the 190 basis point benefit from the legal settlement, which was partially offset by higher brand building and promotional investments as we celebrated our 105th anniversary.\nOperating earnings before financial services of $278.5 million in the quarter, including the benefit from the legal settlement compared to $252.4 million in 2024 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.4%, including 190 basis point benefit from the legal settlement, compared to 22% reported last year.\nFinancial services revenue of [ $101 million ] in the third quarter compared to $100.4 million last year, while operating earnings were $68.9 million compared to $71.7 million in 2024. Consolidated operating earnings of $347.4 million, which includes the legal benefit compared to $324.1 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.9%, including the legal settlement compared to 26% in 2024. Our third quarter effective income tax rate was 22.6% in 2025 and 22.9% 2024.\nNet earnings of $265.4 million or $5.02 per diluted share, including a $16.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share after-tax benefit from the legal settlement compared to $251.1 million or $4.70 per diluted share in 2024.\nIn addition to the benefit from the legal settlement, when comparing the quarter's EPS with the third quarter of the prior year, diluted earnings per share also included approximately $0.09 per share of increased year-over-year nonservice net periodic pension expenses, primarily from higher amortization of actuarial losses.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $367.7 million compared to $365.7 million last year, reflecting a 0.8% organic sales decline, which was more than offset by $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes a mid-single-digit reduction in the segment's Asia Pacific business, partially offset by low single-digit gains with customers in critical industries and a specialty torque operations.\nOverall, the organic sales decline largely reflects a reduction in certain cross-border sourcing activities in the current trade situation, which was offset by improving demand from our critical industry customers, including the United States and international aviation as well as technical education.\nSales to the U.S. military were down year-over-year. However, order activity has been increasing despite the uncertain timing of funding for some government-related projects. Gross margin of 40.9% in the third quarter compared to 41.2% in 2024. This decline was due to 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. In the quarter, higher material and other costs were offset by increased sales in the higher gross margin critical industry sectors and by savings from the segment's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.3% in the quarter compared to 24.5% last year, largely reflecting the impact of lower sales in the Asia Pacific business as well as increased personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings for the C&I segment of $57.5 million compared to $61 million in 2024, the operating margin of 15.6%, improved sequentially from 13.5% in the second quarter and compared to 16.7% last year.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $506 million compared to $50.5 million a year ago, reflecting a 1% organic gain and $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase reflects a low single-digit rise in the segment's international operations and slightly higher sales in the U.S. business.\nDuring the quarter, we believe the introduction of new products like the next-generation Triton Diagnostics platform combined with our ongoing pivot to shorter payback items was successful in overcoming the continuing uncertainty and the confidence of technician customers in the current environment. Gross margin declined 50 basis points to 46.8% in the quarter from 47.3% last year, mostly due to a year-over-year shift in product Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points to 25.1% in the quarter from 25.7% in 2024, largely reflecting the higher sales volumes.\nOperating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $109.9 million compared to $108.3 million in 2024. The operating margin of 21.7% improved 10 basis points from last year.\nTurning to the RS&I Group. Shown on Slide 9. Sales of $464.8 million rose $42.1 million compared to 2024 levels reflecting an 8.9% organic sales increase and $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a strong double-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a high single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These gains more than offset a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment including collision repair products.\nGross margin declined 40 basis points to 47% from 47.4% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of lower gross margin products, higher material and other costs, and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.\nOperating expenses for the RS&I Group in the quarter included a $22 million benefit from the previously mentioned legal settlement. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 540 basis points from last year, primarily due to a 480 basis point benefit from the settlement as well as from the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings of $141.2 million, including the $22 million legal benefit compared to $107.3 million last year. The operating margin of 30.4%, including the 480 basis point benefit compared to 25.4% reported in 2024.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $101.1 million compared to $100.4 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $68.9 million compared to $71.7 million in 2024. Financial services expenses of $32.2 million compared to $28.7 million last year. The increase is primarily due to $2.5 million of higher provisions for credit losses as well as a rise in personnel and other costs.\nAs a percentage of the average financial services portfolio, expenses were 1.3% in the third quarter of 2025 and 1.1% in 2024. In the third quarters of both 2025 and 2024, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% and while the average yield on contract receivables was 9.1%.\nTotal loan originations of $274.1 million in the third quarter represented a decrease of $13.9 million or 4.8% and from 2024 levels, including a 4.9% decline in extended credit originations. The reduction in extended credit origination mostly reflects continued lower sales of discretionary big-ticket items such as tool storage units.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables were $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 2% is up 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2024 and also reflects a typical seasonal increase from the rate reported last quarter.\nTrailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $71.4 million represented a 3.59% of outstandings at quarter end. We believe these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $277.9 million in the quarter compared to $274.2 million last year. Net cash used by investing activities of $21 million, mostly reflected capital expenditures of $19.9 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $180.9 million included cash dividends of $111.5 million and the repurchase of 250,000 shares of common stock for $82 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $306 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade another accounts receivable of $925.7 million included $25.1 million of foreign currency translation. [ $17.7 million ] from the legal settlement and a greater mix of sales with longer payment terms. This represented an increase of $110.1 million from 2024 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 71 days compared to 62 days at year-end 2024.\nInventories increased by $81.1 million from 2024 year-end primarily due to $38.9 million of currency translation improving demand trends and some investment intended to mitigate supply chain uncertainties. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2024.\nOur quarter end cash position of $1,534.1 billion compared to $1,360.5 billion at the end of 2024. In -- our existing cash and expected cash flows from operations -- we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. There were no amounts borrowed or outstanding under the credit facilities during the year nor was any commercial paper issued or outstanding in the year.\nThat concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now review a few outlook items for the fourth quarter of 2025. With respect to corporate costs, we currently believe that expenses will approximate $27 million. Additionally, as recognized in the previous 3 quarters of 2025, we expect to incur approximately $6 million pretax in the fourth quarter of increased nonservice pension costs largely due to higher amortization of actuarial losses. These noncash costs are recorded below operating earnings as part of other income introduction expense net on our statement of earnings and we'll have about $0.09 per diluted share negative effect on EPS in the fourth quarter of 2025. We expect that capital expenditures for the year will approximate $100 billion. And following our assessment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act during the third quarter, we continue to anticipate that our full year 2025 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%.\nFinally, in 2025, our fiscal year will contain 53 weeks of operating results with the additional week occurring at the end of the fourth quarter. This occurs every 5 or 6 years, and historically, it has not had a significant effect on our full year or fourth quarter total revenues and net earnings.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aldo. that's our third quarter. It was encouraging and marked with words like resilience, momentum and advantage. It represents meaningful progress -- are those clearly, one, again, some unprecedented turbulence gains captured against the headwinds of seasonality and increases against the variability of the late summer period. As such, we believe we leave the quarter more confident and stronger than when we entered. The Pivoted & Tools Group is building traction. The potential for critical industries and specialty torque is breaking through, our expansion were repair shop owners and managers continues to rise and our advantage in strategy and structure was -- fortifies our resistance to tariffs demonstrates its efficacy. And you can see it reflected in the group's and the numbers.\nC&I year-over-year gains realized and sequential improvements demonstrated fueled by progress in critical industries and precision chart, gross margin holding firm in a time of trial -- another positive quarter, OI margin up building -- holding to strong levels, OI margin up and holding to strong levels. Momentum continued, sequential growth displayed and the pivot to quicker payback items strengthened. RS&I continuing expansion with repair shop owners and managers, 8.9% organic growth, gains in hardware and software and yet another strong performance in OI margins. And it all came together for an encouraging overall performance.\nSales for the corporation was up organically 3% with sequential gains. Gross margins a powerful 50.9%, down 30 basis points, but primarily due to currency OI margins of 23.4% or 21.5% excluding the legal action, the second highest ever third -- second highest third quarter ever and an EPS of $5.02. And $4.71, excluding legal, the highest ever third quarter in a very turbulent time.\nAs we go forward, we proceed with confidence because we believe our markets will remain robust and Snap-on will benefit from our advantages and strategy making in the markets where we sell in structure enabled by the flexibility of our factory and products, we make work easier and more reliable and everybody knows this.\nIn brand, Snap-on really is the outward sign of pride and dignity for working men and women and advantage in people. Our team is skilled, battle tested committed and always aims high. And we believe this combination of advantages will propel our corporation's even stronger performance as we proceed through 2025 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly with our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. We've spoken today of momentum, of performance and of new highs. We know that all of that has been created by your extraordinary effort in the past 3 months. For the success you've achieved this quarter, you have my congratulations. With the energy and skill I see you bring to the corporation every day, you have my admiration. And for your ongoing confidence and dedication to the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.\nAs usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer, as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.\nAny statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's, or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.\nFinally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute, for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual I'll start the call by covering the highlights from our second quarter, and I'll tell you right now, we're encouraged by the results. Resilience and balance against an environment that's been quite turbulent. It's like one long mad minute where the commercial ground keeps shifting. But with the resilience of our markets, the balance of our portfolio, our advantages in product and brand and people, we navigated the roller coaster and exited the quarter stronger than when we entered.\nSo that's my view. And as we proceed today, I'll begin with more color on our financial results, on our markets, the current environment, the progress we made, and I'll give you another take on what I think it all means. Then Aldo will move to a more detailed review of the financials.\nLet's talk about the results. Our sales of [ $1.179.4 billion ] as reported were flat to last year, including $8.6 million in favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were down -- organic sales were down [ 0.7% ], and they were mixed. But overall balanced. Opco operating income for the quarter was $259.1 million, 7.6% below last year, which included $11.2 million from the nonrecurring 2024 legal win. OI margin was 22.0%, lower by 180 basis points versus last year, which included 100 basis points from that legal matter.\nNotably, the gross margin was 50.5%, 10 basis points behind last year, reflecting continued resilience, rapid continuous improvement balance, 50 basis points of unfavorable currency transactions. In effect, our opco OI gap primarily represented our ongoing investment in maintaining and strengthening our advantages of product and brand and people, believing as we did in the pandemic. That it's best to emerge from the disruption at full strength, and we believe we're on course to do just that.\nFor Financial Services, operating earnings of $68.2 million were down 2.8% from last year's $70.2 million. And combined with the opco results, the overall OI margin for the quarter was 25.5%, which compared 27.4% recorded last year, which included the legal benefit. This time worth 90 basis points.\nEPS for the quarter was $4.72, 35% -- $0.35 below last year. $0.16 from last year's legal payment was included in the '24 number, and this year's level included $0.09 -- a $0.09 impact from higher pension amortization costs. In other words, there were $0.25 of headwind in the year-over-year comparison of EPS.\nSo now let's speak about the market. So those are results. But now let's speak about the market. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be favorable. We did see mixed but improved results with the technician. The Tools Group was up low single digits in the U.S. network, while the international vans were flat. And from what we're hearing directly from the franchisees in [ the text ] from the grassroots, I believe vehicle repair emphatically remains a very favorable place to operate. And the industry metrics continue to confirm that view. Miles driven, average vehicle age, household spend on repairs, [ tech town ] and tech wages, they're all up.\nNow the macro environment is still turbulent. But the tech uncertainty has stabilized. And having said that, it remains significant. And all that, however, the Tools Group pivot does appear to be gaining traction and overcoming the and [indiscernible]. You can see it in our second quarter results. We like the way the numbers are moving. It's a positive side.\nOn the other side of auto repair, where repair systems and information, the RS&I group is displaying encouraging progress, expanding Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers with particular strength in OEM dealerships. Things are looking okay. Upgrading facilities and the OEM dealerships upgraded facilities and equipment to match the growing complexity of the new models. Now there are pockets of hesitation on garage projects, with some independent shops thinking that delay in the turbulence is the right move. But in general, the shops know that deeper complexity is rolling and the challenges are coming and they must be ready. So in general, the segment remains strong, and you can see it all over the RS&I results and for the critical industries.\nNow here, we saw uncertainty and hesitation early in the period. Liberation Day and the weeks that followed created a lot of windage in project planning and execution. Many businesses adopted a wait-and-see approach. Waiting to let the trade program develop before pulling the trigger. And we did see postponements. As the quarter progressed, however, the initial shot gave way to what I would call accommodation. Project flow came back, and our order book has grown. So the critical industry has built momentum through the quarter and they remain a very attractive place to operate despite what we believe may have been a shock blip in the quarter.\nSo overall, I describe our markets as continuing to offer opportunities that we believe display momentum. Challenges doing this. There are headwinds, but we're confident with our advantages and strengthening product lines of soft critical tasks, in our extraordinary brand that marks the [ serious ], the critical and the professional, and our very experienced team that's capable, committed and battle tested, we'll prevail against the difficulties and continue moving positively.\nSo now let's move to the segments. The commercial and industrial group was the place most impacted by the shock early in the quarter. It has the largest international presence. And as critical industry division has a substantial slice of project business. So the group's second quarter as reported volume decreased 6.5%, including $4.5 million in favorable foreign currency translation, and an organic sales decline of 7.6%. C&I's operating income was $46.9 million, below 2024 levels by $15.3 million.\nOperating margin was 13.5%, down 320 basis points. But we did see upward motion as the quarter progressed, as the customers accommodate it to the environment. So we're confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position with C&I as we move forward. Observing a task, using insights to create products that make work easier.\nA great example the next generation -- our next generation of -- the next generation. Quarter-inch drive 14.4-volt cordless ratchets, increased power and speed, 40-foot pounds of torque for break and loose stubborn fasteners. And once freed, the tool is 400 RPMs kick in and the fasteners fly off. It's a real time saver. Our merging North Carolina plant just released two models with [ CCR 25 ] of a compact frame in the [ CTRA27 ] when extended neck. Two tools to maximize efficiency, where techs are working a hard-to-reach out-of-the-way applications.\nAnd there are other great features of the tools. The brushless motors provide improved durability in a longer run time. The variable speed trigger gives us tech more control, preventing in this situation that overtightened that can damage components. And our ring of fire creates a 360 degrees of daylight, beaming from 6 LEDs generating 27 lumens, illuminating even a cavernous workplace. All of this serving to make work much easier.\nThe [ CTR 25 and 27 ] contract frame and long neck designs, techs love them. They know they need both of them. And based on a strong recession, it's now clear they're destined for our $1 million hit product list.\nNow the specialty torque business remains red hot. It actually had a strong quarter. Part of the reason is that our lineup continues to expand, moving to meet the increasing and complex challenges of essential bolting the tensioning. And recently, we introduced the new [ CTM 550 ] unit and joined our rolling over of cordless torque multipliers. This tool, 66% lighter, 20% smaller than its big brother, the 1-inch [ CTM-800 ], and it delivers effortlessly delivers torque, all the way from 160-foot pumps to 550-foot pound. It's ideal for tackling a range of tasks and a growing number of heavy-duty applications that require precise torque.\nThe new tool enables much greater efficiency and comfort, and replaces the commonly used impact gun and torque wrench combinations with a single tool, eliminating several cumbersome steps, providing a much safer and more ergonomic path to repair. If the design that combines the efficiency of our extraordinary [indiscernible] gear designs with the brushless motors of our power tools operation, to make problem torque, to make precision torque, at high output a breeze. And the unique Snap-on advanced [indiscernible] there's no pun intended, means the extended use and increased durability.\nThe CTM also has multiple connection options, enabling the accuracy of the procedure to be documented and reviewed and showing that the job was done correctly and that the bus, or semi truck, or bulldozer will operate as designed, and safely, and without failure. Our [ CTM 550 ] sophisticated, powerful versatile with the durability to tackle the harshest environments, servicing the needs of the critical and as you might imagine, it's been well received.\nWell, that's C&I. Absorbing the shock, moving forward. Delivering solutions that make critical work easier, safer and more productive. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 1.6% with low single -- with a low single-digit improvement in the U.S. and the international network flat to last year. The operating income. It was $116.7 million, and that compares with $114.8 million in 2024, with an operating margin of 23.8%, flat to last year. But still one of the group's top margin levels ever achieved against the wind.\nAs I said, technicians are still cash rich for competence core and they're still hesitant to tie themselves to long-term obligations. Originations were down 4.9%. Sales items like large storage boxes decreased in the quarter, but our connection with grassroots customers indicate that the uncertainty is stabilized. And over the period, the Tools Group pivot to faster payback items gained traction against the continuing wars, the rapid fire announcements in the capital, and the [ threat ] of inflation. All through the quarter, we kept working shift in production, refocusing marketing and promotional campaigns, and most important of all, introducing innovative new products that make an immediate impact, offerings that created a short-term payback.\nSo for tech servicing a growing servicing vehicles of growing complexity, access is big. They need help, reaching, squeezing, contorting their way into compact areas, trying to make repairs without dismantling things like parts like -- components like fenders or grills or dashboards. Every day where they're in the garage, observing these tests, developing the solutions that make the work easier and more profitable. It's Snap-on's principal value creating mechanism well in the -- during the quarter, the Tools Group launched a number of new products. Each delivering unparalleled access and matching the customers' preference for faster paybacks.\nOne is the FDA [indiscernible] 102, a 2-piece radiator pick set. Each unit is 7 inches for handle to the tip and offers a unique design. One is hook shaped, ideal for pulling hoses away. And the other is straight, perfect for pushing the cooling lines free. The complete set is built in our [indiscernible], Alabama facility, and it might seem trivial. But I assure you, modern vehicle engine base are jampacked. Hoses are no longer out in the open. And now even basic repairs more often than not require removing fan shrouds or a range of other parts.\nBut with these tools, a tech can extract the hose with ease. Conventional setups have similar geometries, but they require much more space to function, or no picks, give great access and they do save a lot of time in a text of notice.\nAnother quick payback is our [ FKC 72 ]. 3 inch drives, stubby length, hand ratchet, [indiscernible] Tennessee plant. It's our smallest 3 inch [indiscernible] ever. I mean it's tiny About the length of your pinky. And I know there are a lot of narrow passages in the car. Well, this stuff you can go wherever your fingers can reach. But even though it's small, it offers great strength, courtesy of Snap-on's unique [ dual poll ] system, and the 72-tooth design enables 5 degrees -- a 5-degree swing arc, another access enabler. And the sealed [ head ] increases reliability, keeping the debris that can muck up the works from entering the gear mechanism. It's another Snap-on must-have serious checks and it helped drive the pivot in the quarter.\nPerhaps, best of all, just released, the redesigned 15-inch extra long needle [ nose ] flyer set. Cold forged at our Milwaukee plant. Now that's a process that's difficult to master. But if you get it right, and Milwaukee is one of the few who can, it results in greater strength and delivers [ tighter talents ] without additional and more costly machining. The long flier [indiscernible] reaches through restricted openings, creating access and the cold forging process, and the associated shaft strength enabled 85% more gripping power than other models. And that makes this tool real time saver.\nI mean if you drop a part in a recessed area, no need to disassemble the work base. These units will navigate through the confined space and they'll grab the loss component without letting go, making sure of a quick -- making sure and quick retrieval. That's a great and significant advantage.\nEach of these new products make work easier repairs faster. And all three have already achieved what we call our $1 million hit product status. And meeting with -- in the last quarter, we talked about this, about the bottom end of the bigger ticket items. After meeting the -- and meeting the tech's preference for a faster payback tool storage, our plant in Algona, Iowa, released a special offering over entry-level [ KRA2422 ] Classic series [ roll cab ]. [indiscernible] is 55 inches wide, go from one piece welded body, which is with reinforced corners and a 14-gig steel bottom panel that supports a payload of 2,400 pounds over a ton of tools.\nIt's ideal for organizing a tech investments with 2 doors spanning 50 inches wide, one 5-inch deep for deep sockets, at a 3-inch store for store along [indiscernible] and [ extension ]. The box is functional logged and it's relatively economical.\nBut we'll get your attention in this array -- is the array of eye pop and 2-tone paint schemes. One, a black case with extreme green doors and black trim is my personal favorite. I can tell you, it is bright. Any tech would stand out with this beaming box in this space. [ Series ] just came out and it's already had significant demand.\nSo that's the tools book. [ Pivot ]. Gaining on uncertainty back to growth. Exiting the quarter with momentum and great American-made products were the big drivers.\nNow RS&I. Sales in the second quarter were $468.6 million, with an organic gain of 2.2%, a high single-digit advancement in diagnostics information and strong double-digit improvements in our OEM businesses. Operating earnings, or RS&I, were $119.8 million, up $6.2 million, or 5.5%. And the operating margin of 25.6% was 60 basis points better than 2024.\nNow just a little fun fact. The OI margin for RS&I has increased year-over-year for 12 of the last 13 quarters, six straight. That's the rise of software and the power of RCI, boom shakalaka. RS&I shined through the turbulence, leveraging our customer connection and launching innovative products. One example is [indiscernible] born in our San Jose facility, positioned in the middle of our intelligent diagnostics offering. [indiscernible] provides a wireless connection between the car and the handout. Text can move freely around the bay, under the car, under the car inspecting, troubleshooting and testing without restraint. And this is important. It does that without losing the lightning speed that's the hallmark of our wired units.\nAnd [ Trans 2-channel Lasko ] now provides zoom capability, and this is crucial. When a [indiscernible] form glitches happen in a blink of an eye, as they often do. The hard to catch on and stand the units. So [ Triton ] customers can now record, play back the tests, magnify the pattern zero in on the abnormally, and identify intermittent problems. That's right. Its flexibility, speed, zoom capability, 8-hour battery life for extended use and 4x the memory, handling more procedures and data, handling more procedures in data than ever. The launch easily exceeded prior releases. As you might expect, this gang busters platform is powerful in tech hands, and it's a clear winner in the shops.\nRS&I is on a roll. Great diagnostic and it's a powerful database. [indiscernible] demand, repair information, the proprietary power of intelligence diagnostics, effective shop management system, continuing upward progress, driven by great hardware, a significant advantage of the software and a dedication to RCI. We're going to keep driving to expand our RS&I position [ with ] repair shop owners and managers, offering more new products developed by our value creation process, and we're confident it's a winning formula.\nWell, that's our second quarter. Marked by both challenge and advancement. C&I down, impacted by the shock liberation day and about of wait and see, but some recovery is underway as a combination of developers. The Tools Group. [indiscernible] quicker paybacks gaining traction. Sales up 1.6% organically. OI margin, 23.8%, flat to last year, but representing the third highest in the group's history against the wins.\nAnd RS&I, sales up 2.2%, OI margin, 25.6%, up 60 basis points, software rising and RCI delivering again. It all came together for overall sales of [ $1,794 million ], flat gross margins, 5.5%, down 10 basis points, unfavorable currency transaction and the impact of a volatile trade policy balanced by RCI. And OI margins of 22%, down 80 basis points adjusting for last year's legal benefit, primarily reflecting the conviction to keep investing in product and brand and people. The results demonstrating operational strength, all achieved in difficult conditions. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results for the second quarter are summarized on Slide 6.\nNet sales of [ $1.174 billion ] in the quarter were unchanged from last year, reflecting an $8.6 million organic sales decline that was offset by favorable foreign currency translation. Sales in our automotive repair markets were up, with gains both in our franchise van channel and in activity with OEM dealership and independent repair shop owners and managers.\nWithin the industrial sector for our C&I group, sales were down year-over-year, reflecting the economic and geopolitical uncertainty that occurred throughout the period. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5%, compared to 50.6% last year, and included 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from the company's RCI initiatives.\nWhile Snap-on is relatively advantaged in the current tariff environment, generally manufacturing products in the markets where they are sold. Our cost can be affected by trade politics. In the quarter, we mitigated the effect of incremental tariffs, managing material and other costs so that there was no meaningful impact on gross margins.\nWith respect to the unfavorable foreign currency effects in the quarter, much of this was due to transaction impacts of the year-over-year strengthening of the Swedish Krona, versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar, as we have factories in Sweden, serving both the C&I and RS&I groups. In C&I, we manufacture cutting tools for our European and emerging markets, while in the RS&I, our car liner facility produces collision products that are sold globally.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 170 basis points to 28.5%, from 26.8% in 2024, mostly due to a nonrecurring benefit of $11.2 million from legal payments received last year, and increased personnel and other costs, including ongoing brand investments. Operating earnings before financial services of $259.1 million in the quarter, compared to $280.3 million in 2024. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22%, compared to 23.8% reported last year, which included a benefit of 100 basis points from the legal payments.\nFinancial services revenue of $101.7 million in the second quarter, compared to $100.5 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.2 million compared to $70.2 million in 2024. Consolidated operating earnings of $327.3 million, compared to $350.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.5%, compared to 27.4% in 2024, again, including a benefit from the legal [indiscernible].\nOur second quarter effective income tax rate was 22.5% in 2025, and 22.6% in 2024. Net earnings of $250.3 million, compared to $271.2 million in 2024. And net earnings per diluted share of $4.72 in the quarter, compared to $5.07 per diluted share last year.\nWhen comparing the quarter's earnings per share with the second quarter of the prior year, there is $0.25 per share of headwinds on a year-over-year basis. In the second quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share included approximately $0.09 per share of increased year-over-year nonservice and net periodic pension expenses. Primarily from higher amortization of actuarial losses, while the second quarter of 2024 included a $0.16 per share benefit from the legal payments.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $347.8 million, compared to $372 million last year, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales decline, partially offset by $4.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic reduction includes double-digit decreases in the segment's Asia Pacific and European-based [indiscernible] businesses. And a mid-single-digit decline in activity with customers in critical industries, partially offset by a high single-digit rise in the specialty torque operation.\nOverall, the sales decline reflects a reduction in certain cross-border sourcing activities in the current trade situation, and the slowdown of projects by our customers in some industries and geographies, including U.S. aviation and the military. With respect to critical industries, demand was challenged in April but improved as we moved through the quarter. Gross margin of 40% in the second quarter, compared to 41.7% in 2024. This decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 26.5% in the quarter, compared to 25%, largely reflecting the impact of reduced sales volumes, as well as increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $46.9 million, compared to $62.2 million last year. The operating margin of 13.5%, compared to 16.7% in 2024.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group [indiscernible] $491 million, compared to $482 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.6% organic gain, and a $1.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase reflects a low single-digit rise in the United States business, while activity in our international operations was essentially flat.\nDuring the quarter, we believe our ongoing pivot to shorter payback items was successful in overcoming the continuing uncertainty of technician customers in the current environment. Gross margin declined 50 basis points to 48.3% in the quarter, from 48.8% last year, mostly due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 50 basis points to 24.5% in the quarter from 25% in 2024, largely reflecting the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116.7 million, compared to $114.8 million last year. The operating margin of 23.8% was unchanged from 2024.\nTurning to the RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $468.6 million, compared to $154.8 million in 2024, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales increase and $3.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a double-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, and a high single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products, to independent repair shop owners and managers. These gains more than offset a high single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment, including collision repair products.\nGross margin improved 130 basis points to 46.8%, from 45.5% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of higher gross margin products and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher material, freight and other costs as well as 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 70 basis points to 21.2%, and 20.5% in 2024, largely due to increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $119.8 million, compared to $113.6 million last year. The operating margin improved 60 basis points to 25.6% from 25% recorded in 2024.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $101.7 million reflected an increase of $1.2 million from $10.5 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $68.2 million, compared to $70.2 million in 2024. Financial services expenses of $33.5 million, compared to $30.3 million last year. The increase is primarily due to $1.5 million of higher provisions for credit losses, as well as a rise in personnel and other costs.\nAs a percentage of the average financial services portfolio expenses were 1.3% in the second quarter of 2025, and 1.2% in 2024. In the second quarter of 2025 and 2024, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.5% and 17.7%, while the average yield on contract receivables were 9.1% and 8.9% respectively. Total loan originations of $293 million in the second quarter represented a decrease of $15.1 million, or 4.9%, from 2024 levels, including a 5% decline in extended credit originations.\nThe reduction in extended credit originations mostly reflects lower sales of discretionary big-ticket items such as tool storage units, partially offset by higher originations associated with the successful launch of the new [ Triton Diagnostics ] platform during the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables and $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% is up 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2024, but down 20 basis points from the rate reported last quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $69.5 million represented 3.46% of outstanding at quarter end. We believe these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $237.2 million in the quarter, compared to $301.1 million last year. The lower cash flow generation as compared to the second quarter of 2024, largely reflects higher year-over-year increases in working investment and lower net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $46 million, mostly reflected net additions to finance receivables of $26.4 million and capital expenditures of $19.7 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $170.9 million included cash dividends of $111.8 million, and the repurchase of 250,000 shares of common stock for $79 million, under our existing share repurchase program. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $357.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable represented an increase of $26.8 million from 2024 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 65 days were down 1 day sequentially from last quarter, and compared to 62 days at year-end 2024. Inventories increased by $54.3 million from 2024 year-end, primarily due to $37.4 million of currency translation and some investment intended to mitigate supply chain uncertainty. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4, were the same as year-end 2024.\nOur quarter end cash position of [ $1.458 billion ] compared to [ $1.365 billion ] at year-end 2024. In addition to our existing cash, and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. There were no amounts [indiscernible] or outstanding under the credit facilities during the year, nor was any commercial paper issued, or outstanding in the year.\nThat concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now review a few outlook items for the balance of the year. With respect to corporate costs. We currently believe that expenses for the remainder of 2025 will approximate $27 million per quarter. Additionally, during 2025, as previously shared, we recognize and expect to continue to incur approximately $6 million pretax per quarter of increased nonservice pension costs, largely due to higher amortization of actuarial losses. These noncash costs are recorded below operating earnings as part of other income and expense net on our statement of earnings and will have about a $0.09 per diluted share quarterly negative effect on EPS for the balance of 2025.\nWe expect that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million, and we currently anticipate that our full year 2025 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. Our expected range which factors in the U.S. tax bill that was recently passed, is unchanged from previous estimates.\nFinally, in 2025. Our fiscal year will contain 53 weeks of operating results with an additional week occurring at the end of the fourth quarter. This occurs every 5 or 6 years, and historically, it has not had a significant effect on our full year or fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings.\nI'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aldo. Snap-on the second quarter results. Marked by resilience, portfolio balance, shock, accommodation and progress. C&I, International markets and critical industries disrupted by Liberation Day. The shock giving away to accommodation and -- accommodation in the storm -- or to the storm.\nTools Group. Continuing uncertainty. [indiscernible] gaining some traction. Sales up 1.6% organically. U.S. up, international flat, a return to positive. OI margins, 23.8% flat to last year, but among the group's strongest ever. RS&I continuing strength, sales up 2.3% organically. Opco OI margin of 25.6%, up 60 basis points rising again. And it all came together for an overall demonstration of performance against turbulence. Sales of the -- for the corporation were [ $1.1794 billion ], essentially flat and the difficulty. Opco O-I margin 22%, down 80 basis points adjusting for last year's legal benefit, with the gap driven primarily by spending to maintain full strength preserving advantage for when the turbulence abates. And EPS $4.72, against comparisons against 25% -- $0.25 of headwinds.\nWe believe that these results demonstrate our overall strength. They also highlight a relative advantage in the turbulence of the volatile trade policy. Strengths rooted in our strategy of making in the markets where we sell and in our solid structure of broadly based facilities. 36 factories, 15 in the U.S., and in the considerable distributed know-how. We make a version of our products in almost every region, but especially in the U.S. We believe this advantage is clearly on display in our quarter's gross margin of 50.5%, down 10 basis points from last year. But a shortfall more than explained by 50 basis points of unfavorable currency that was offset by RCI.\nYou see, we said we believed we're resistant to tariffs, and we meant it. And we further believe that as we move forward, we have momentum as a shock recedes, and we have advantaged rooted deeply in our products, continually matching the increase in complexity work, making it much easier. Advantage in our brand that really does mark the professional and displays personal and collective pride and dignity. Of course, advantage in our people, dedicated, capable, battle tested and welding the Snap-on value creation processes to improve every day as they demonstrated in the quarter.\nSo we believe that as we move forward using those strengths inherent in our enterprise will prevail against a difficulty, execute on our abundant opportunities and move positively through the last half of 2025 and well beyond.\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our associates and franchisees. I know many are listening. My friends. I know that the encouraging results we just discussed was created by your efforts, past and present. For your progress against the turbulence, you have my congratulations. For the energy, you bring to our enterprise every day, you have my admiration. And for your confident and unwavering commitment to our future, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] Note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.

These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.\nAdditional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the market environment and on our progress. It was considerable. After that, and as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. These are interesting times, filled with uncertainty. But Snap-on is built to prevail even in turbulence. And this isn't our first rodeo, it's our job to confront and to overcome and to proceed with confidence in the resilience of our market, confidence in the strength of our strategic and tactical advantages and confidence in the insight and energy of our consistent and capable people. And all of that echoed in the numbers. So here they are. Overall sales in the quarter were $1,198.7 million, up 0.2% both as reported and organically, returned to positive territory. Profitability was strong with gross margin of 49.7%, a gain of 140 basis points.\nAnd the opco OI margin was 22.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over 2023 and an all-time high for the fourth quarter. Financial Services earnings of $66.7 million in the quarter were lower by $1.2 million, leading to a consolidated margin, including both opco and financial services at 25.5%, an improvement of 30 basis points. Our EPS for the quarter was $4.82, up $0.07 from the $4.75 recorded last year.\nThe results show broad gains overcoming the uncertainty, another period of sequential progress, brought by record performances by both the commercial and industrial, C&I, by the commercial industrial C&I group and by Repair System Information, or the RS&I group, combined with the Tools Group successfully pivoting to match tech preferences and continuing to narrow the gap versus last year. It was an encouraging demonstration of advantage our resilience and of capability.\nBut first, let's speak about the markets. We believe the vehicle repair market is robust, a continuing stream of new tools and data to confront the rising complexity of the modern vehicle. The repair shops today, dealerships or independents must deal with an expanding array of challenges, multiple powertrains, EV, plug-in hybrid, super hybrid, advanced combustion, sophisticated digital system and a wide range of autonomous operations, devices like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, collision avoidance sensors, self-parking features, it goes on and on and on, and the list is getting longer. And technicians have to fix it all, addressing a array of procedures. It's daunting, but this is where Snap-on shines, scanning, diagnosing, guiding and fixing, enabling the techs -- making -- enabling the techs, making the difficult tasks easier and when combined with an aging car park that now averages 12.6 years and includes a multitude of technology generations, all needing to be fixed, driving even more complexity and requiring even more tools and more data.\nIt represents even more opportunity. We love it. Vehicle repair has several slices. So let's start by focusing on shops, the dealerships and the independent shops, adjusting to the complexity often requiring things like new lifting equipment to handle the increased weight of EVs, tire changes that accommodate larger wheel sizes, software suites for managing the shop, for organizing parts data into streamlined catalog, for scheduling repairs and customer interfaces and for guiding the techs to the most sophisticated or complicated of repairs. This is where RS&I operates.\nIt's a target-rich environment for our array of undercar and collision equipment, and it's a growing market for our software and data products. And Snap-on is well positioned with our innovative hardware, but especially with our proprietary comprehensive database, billions of insightful records, advantages that we believe -- there are advantages that we believe make Snap-on the data king in vehicle repair, a position that I think you'll see was reinforced again [ by our quarter ] by our rising gains in that arena.\nNow let's shift to the techs. The individuals working in a base, under the hood, twirling the wrenches, hitting the touchscreen, applying their skill and making -- and actually making the repair. Again, this quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of franchisees and their customers. And they all expressed their enthusiasm for the strength of vehicle repair and external data confirms that view. Miles driven up. The car park age, hospital spending on auto -- household spending on auto repair is higher, hours were increasing. And best of all, tech wages rising. I was recently in a garage and the service manager emphatically proclaimed to me that the work just keeps rolling in. We need more techs makes sense, expanding complexity means more time spent on each repair and more trained professionals needed to meet the demand and keep the shops prospering.\nSo it's clear the techs are in a good position, but that doesn't make them immune to the macro uncertainty around the ongoing wars, immigration disputes, lingering inflation. And although the election's in the rear mirror and the new team may be more focused on business expansion, there's a rapid fire of new initiatives, tariff bonds, on and off again actions, impending shakeups and foreign ventures of many varieties up to now, it's hard not to be uncertain about what's up.\nSo the franchisees, they echo that uncertainty. And in the turbulence, the technicians continue to prefer quick payback items. Ones that make work easier and cut labor times right away, items like hand tools and [indiscernible] diagnostics that can be paid off in shorter cycles. And they remain cool on big ticket, longer payback items like tool storage. So the Tools Group is continuing its pivot, focusing its engineering, it's manufacturing and it's selling to match the shift in those customer preferences.\nSo despite some challenges in automotive, so despite some challenges, automotive repair does remain strong, and we believe we're pivoting successfully to take greater advantage. Now let's talk about critical industries, where C&I take Snap-on out of the garage, solving consequent that require precision durability, reliability and repeatability all performed in some of the most demanding [indiscernible] environment, from clean rooms to mine pits to assembly lines to building spacecraft in this market. I can tell you, it's very promising.\nOur activity in critical industries continued rising across multiple sectors aviation, natural resources and general industry were all up nicely. The arena also represents our most significant international presence. And those markets were mixed. In Europe, U.K. and Southern Europe up; Germany, down; and Asia Pacific, China weaker, but gains in Japan and South Asia, despite -- in Southeast Asia, despite unfavorable currency. And gains in South Korea as well. I'll add that to that situation, despite unfavorable currency. So C&I does have its challenges across the geographies and the segments, but we have made significant advantages -- advancements and do see substantial opportunities for tomorrow, leveraging our advantages in product, in our brand, in our people.\nAnd I think when you see the results, you realize, it's working. So both the auto repair and critical industries market remain positive, and we're ready and well positioned to advance on those, I don't know, very wide runways. At the same time, it's clear, it's clear to us, and I hope it's clear to you that we have more potential along our runways for improvement. And as we proceed, we're fortified by our Snap-on value creation process, safety, quality, customer protection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement or RCI, they've never been more important, helping overcome the turbulence and [ authoring ] our resilience. Especially important is customer connection and innovation. That's our unique advantage standing next to working men and women observing each task, matching the insights gained with technology master developing new and innovative products that makes work easier.\nAnd it's a considerable strength, and our team is committed to continue to wheel it with determination. Now let's talk about the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $379.2 million was an all-time high, represented an increase of $15.3 million versus last year and included $2.1 million in acquisition-related sales, $1 million in unfavorable foreign currency and our organic rise of 3.9%, driven by gains with customers in critical industries. Strong sales of our customized kits led the way, meeting the rising demand for solutions that match specific tasks. Our Specialty Torque division was also a clear positive. Precision is becoming more essential every day and our broad torque offering put C&I right on target, and you can see it clearly in the numbers.\nOI for C&I was $63.5 million in the quarter, up $9.4 million or 17.4% from 2023 and the group gross margin, it was up 180 basis points, and the operating margin was 16.7%. That was also up 180 basis points. C&I just keeps getting better. It's a great indication of our ability to roll out of the garage. The specialty torque business of C&I is really making strides. Torque is hot now. And Snap-on is at the party with a growing array of new products like our heavy-duty cordless torque multiplier, we call it the CTMA 100 delivering torque from 160-foot pounds all the way up to 800-foot pounds, just what's needed to meet the broad challenge of across mining, in oil and gas and rail and heavy duty. It's a tool that anyhow -- it was a tool that was made possible by our expansion in torque.\nCombining the efficiencies of a Norbar gear design with the compact operation of a Snap-on power tool, authoring the wide range, making the delivery of high torque levels easy and safe. So enabling easy access to tight spots. The new units also equipped with a specially designed transducer control for applying just the precise force, a breakthrough. And it benefits from our advanced power tool cooling system that makes it much more durable. The CTM 800 torque packs a lot into one compact tool, improvement in versatility, safety, access, durability and precision. It has it all and where the tasks are critical. It's already a big hit.\nC&I, sales up, customized kits and precision torque, rising to new levels, all with record profitability, a high point profitability, with much more room to grow and improve. Now on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $506.6 million, down but representing progress and narrowing the gap versus 2023. The progress is evident, but uncertainty still lingers. And OI for the Tools Group was $106.9 million, $4.1 million below 2023 with an operating margin of 21.1%. But despite the turbulence, we remain steadfast in supporting our van network, keeping it strong, spending on it. And that profitability was regionally acknowledged by multiple publications. The Franchise Business Review recognized us and its latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listing Snap-on as a top 50 franchise for the 18th consecutive year.\nWe renamed #1 among all franchisees in Entrepreneur Magazine's 2024 list of top franchises for veterans. And Snap-on was ranked by the U.K. Elite Franchise Magazine as the #1 franchise in that country, a distinction we've held for 3 consecutive years. Now these types of rankings confirm the fundamental strengths of our franchisees individually and of our van business in general. And I can tell you that this would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of new products developed through our strong customer connections, insight and experience transformed an innovation for a significant advantage in the rapidly changing world that's vehicle repair. One of the latest of those additions is our Milwaukee-manufactured special Hex driver, specifically designed for modern vehicles equipped with advanced driver assist systems like adaptive cruise control in the base standing side-by-side with the techs making the actual repairs, we saw the difficulty in aligning the radar centers that enable that autonomous control, enable the adaptive cruise control.\nAnd the work was difficult. Techs are removing the bumpers in the grills, dismantling the front end of the car just to reach the workplace, a very time-consuming and non-value-added exercise that risks damage to nearby -- that also risks damage to nearby parts and components, all just to clear the pathway for the eventual repair. And that observation drove the design of our new [ NDDM 35 ], a 3.5-millimeter hex driver featuring an extra long 5.75 inch shaft, an enhanced reach that bypasses the obstructions with ease, allowing the necessary adjustments without dismantling anything. And that newly launched tool also includes our Snap-on instinct ergonomic handle design, providing superior control, making it easier to execute the work with the precision required for the very sensitive radar brackets.\nOur new NDD35--M35 makes repairs faster, easier and more profitable and the techs have noticed it. Also in the quarter, we launched a new lineup of hand tools based on another customer connection. We're seeing the difficulty of applying leverage to the opening of a standard combination wrench, the box end of the tool was great for engaging a fastener in a crowded engine bay, just slide it right in there. But when extreme force was needed and a grip at the opposite far end was necessary, the task was extremely uncomfortable because the open end of the wrench digs into your hand.\nTo solve the problem, our engineers designed our new XDSGM, a series that combines a box in, low profile ahead with a soft grip ratchet handle, providing the access technicians need but enabling the maximum force to be applied comfortably with the ergonomically and contoured cushion grip handle, breaking bolts free without wincing in pain or slipping off under load. The new XD SGM, I talk about it here because it's a prime example of a fast payback item, a simple but powerful innovation that makes work safer, faster and easier and the techs have loved it, making the wrench one of our million dollar hit products just since it launched a few months ago.\nWell, that's the Tools Group. Customer connection, producing innovative products, operations continuing to pivot meeting the customers' perseverance for fast payback items and making progress and narrowing of the gap, all while keeping the network strong in the turbulence.\nNow for RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $456.6 million, up organically, 1.6%. gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shop owners for diagnostic platforms and repair information products, partially offset by lower activity in undercar equipment. RS&I operating earnings in the quarter were of $121.4 million represented an increase of $8.1 million or 7.1%. Gross margins were up 200 basis points, and the operating margin, the operating margin was a strong 26.6%, up 150 basis points from last year from the prior year, the highest ever, a record -- and the record reflects a rise in software, but it's also evidence of -- the rising software is a great thing, but it's also evidence of strong and broad [ RSI ] with the great majority of RSI businesses, software and hardware, increasing margins by well over 100 basis points .\nWe really love that kind of thing because it makes our profitability soar. And our Mitchell 1 specialty -- speaking of profitability, our Mitchell 1 specialty software division provides software to independent shops, continue [indiscernible] success expanding its database, Big data, reaching 3 billion repair records and 500 million data points, a powerful and proprietary advantage that fuels our intelligent diagnostics platform, communicating directly with vehicles, translating to [ trouble codes ], supplying complex inductive weldings, complex inductive models, identifying the problem and guiding technicians through the repair process, all with unprecedented speed, productivity and profitability.\nNow we can't talk about that without talking about the APOLLO+, the newest member of the intelligent diagnostics lineup, released in the late third quarter, and it continues to shine, surpassing previous generations and very importantly, expanding the number of software subscriptions. It's easy, fast and smart. And for this day and age, at this time, it represents a tech's quickest payback access to the power of Snap-on Intelligent Diagnostics. We expected it to be a winner, and it is.\nAlso in the quarter, Undercar Equipment division released the new V4400 Commander wheel alignment machine. It's a game changer for shops because of its unique flexibility. A lot of shops don't have space and they don't do alignments at all. They send them out. Garages today need new equipment for matching the equipment of that kind, for matching the rising complexity. For example, alignment has never been more important. But where do you fit the new units without a costly expansion.\nAnd in many cases, the buildings are already land locked. And shop owners can't sacrifice an everyday repair base for periodic, but necessary profitable and profitable alignment procedures. So the answer is the V4400, a versatile smart and modular system. It's got an innovative design with a control center housed in a small toolbox that wirelessly connects with the 2 twin independent mobile towers that holds sophisticated force camera -- that hold a sophisticated force camera setup.\nThose sections can easily be stored out of the way while not in action and can be assembled anywhere in the shop quickly, delivering an alignment capability as needed and on command regardless of the layout, whether you shop is short or wide or deeper narrow, it doesn't matter. And our proprietary software with our -- based on our 4-camera systems, enables a very quick setup. So therefore, setting it up is pretty easy and quick. And no shop is perfect. So our system also automatically eliminate imperfections like unlevel lifts or uneven floors, ensuring an accurate, straight as an arrow alignment, the V4400 aligner is nimble, versatile, quick and smart and it makes profitable alignment possible and many more shops. It's a great product.\nWe keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more new products, all developed by our value creation processes, and we're confident it's a winning formula. And the Q4 results say it so. Well, that's the quarter. Sales up, 0.2% back to level. opco operating margin of 22.1%, up 50 basis points, a new all-time high for the fourth quarter. The Tools Group down, but narrowing the gap. The pivot is working. RS&I operating margin, 26.6%, up 150 basis points, another profit high for an already high-margin group. C&I operating margins up -- operating earnings, up 17.4%; operating margin, 16.7%, up 180 basis points, also at a high resilience, balance, advantage and results. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results for the fourth quarter are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,198.7 million in the quarter were slightly above the $1.196.6 million reported last year, reflecting an organic sales increase of $2 million. Continued strength in sales to customers in critical industries as well as gains with repair shop owners and managers, offset the marginally lower sales of our franchise van network. Consolidated gross margin improved 140 basis points to 49.7% from 48.3% last year, reflecting increased sales and higher gross margin businesses as well as benefits from the company's RCI initiatives.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 90 basis points to 27.6% from 26.7% in 2023, primarily due to increased corporate and other operating costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $265.2 million in the quarter compared to $257.9 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22.1% represented an improvement of 50 basis points from the 21.6% reported last year. Financial services revenue of $100.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $97.2 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.7 million compared to $67.9 million in 2023.\nConsolidated operating earnings of $331.9 million compared to $325.8 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin increased 30 basis points to 25.5% in 2024. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.5% compared to 21.4% last year. Net earnings of $258.1 million compared to $255.3 million in 2023 and net earnings per diluted share of $4.82 in the quarter, compared to $4.75 per diluted share last year.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I on Slide 7. Sales of $379.2 million compared to $363.9 million last year, reflecting a 3.9% organic sales gain and $2.1 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic improvement is largely due to gain in sales to customers serving critical industries, including a high single-digit increase in specialty torque.\nWith respect to critical industries, in addition to higher torque product sales, activities in aviation and general industries were encouraging during the period. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 41% in the fourth quarter from 39.2% in 2023. This is largely due to increased sales volumes and higher gross margin, critical industry sectors and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24.3% in the quarter was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $63.5 million compared to $54.1 million last year. The operating margin improved 180 basis points to 16.7% from 14.9% in 2023.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $506.6 million compared to $513.3 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.4% organic sales decline and $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a low single-digit decline in the United States business, partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations. Again, this quarter, we believe that continued attenuation and a relatively modest year-over-year sales decline in the U.S. mobile network favorably demonstrates the resilience of this business given the still uncertain environment.\nGross margin declined 60 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter from 45.2% last year, mostly due to the decreased volumes and the effects of increased sales of lower gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter from 23.6% in 2023. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $106.9 million compared to $111 million last year. The operating margin of 21.1% compared to 21.6% in 2023.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $456.6 million compared to $450.8 million in 2023, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a mid-single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, and a low single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.\nThe latter aided by the introduction of our new APOLLO+ handheld diagnostic platform. These gains more than offset a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 47% from 45% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of higher gross margin products, including a more favorable mix of software and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 50 basis points to 20.4% from 19.9% in 2023, largely due to increased personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings for the RS&I Group of $121.4 million compared to $113.3 million last year, the operating margin improved 150 basis points to 26.6% from the 25.1% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $3.3 million or 3.4% to $100.5 million from $97.2 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $66.7 million compared to $67.9 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $4.5 million from 2023 levels, including $4.4 million of higher provisions for credit losses.\nAs a percentage of the average services portfolio, the financial services portfolio, expenses were 1.3% in the quarter as compared to 1.2% last year. In the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.8%, while the average yield on contract receivables were 9.1% and 8.9%, respectively. Total loan originations of $285.1 million in the fourth quarter represented a decrease of $18 million or 5.9% from 2023 levels, including a 5.8% decline in extended credit originations.\nThe decrease in extended credit originations mostly reflects lower sales of big-ticket longer payback items. Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion coming from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 2% is up 20 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023. The Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $66.3 million represented a 3.32% of outstandings at year-end.\nWhile delinquencies and net losses have been trending upward, we believe that these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment. Now turning to Slide 12 for the quarter. Cash increased by $47.2 million as compared to an increase of $42.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Cash provided by operating activities of $293.5 million in the quarter represented 11% of net earnings.\nNet cash used by investing activities of $40.2 million, mostly reflected net additions to finance receivables of $26.2 million and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $201.5 million included cash dividends of $112.3 million and the repurchase of 315,000 shares of common stock for $112.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $429.4 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $24.3 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 60 days at year-end 2023. Inventories decreased $62.5 million from 2023 year-end and on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our year-end cash position of $1,360.5 million compared to $1,001.5 million at the end of 2023. In addition to our existing cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities, and there were no amounts borrowed or outstanding under the credit facility during the year, nor was any commercial paper issued or outstanding in the year.\nThat concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2025. With respect to corporate cost, we currently believe that the expenses in each quarter of 2025 will be relatively in line with those incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024 or about $27 million per quarter. Additionally, during 2025, we expect to incur approximately $6 million pretax per quarter of increased nonservice pension costs, largely due to higher amortization of actuarial losses.\nThese noncash costs will be recorded below operating earnings as part of other income and expense net on our statement of earnings. We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2025 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. Finally, in 2025, our fiscal year will contain 53 weeks of operating results with the additional week occurring at the end of the fourth quarter. This occurs every 5 or 6 years. And historically, it has not had a significant effect on our full year or fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings. I'll now call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Aldo. Well, our fourth quarter progressed against uncertainty. The markets remain robust, repair spending up, the number of techs up, wages up, car park aging and the vehicle complexity rising. But the uncertainty remains created by the unpredictable macro environment, but we did make progress against the wind. Resilience was on display in the Tools Group. The pivot is succeeding and the gap shrinking. And the balance and breadth of our operations was evident in the performance of C&I and RS&I, both turning in solid quarters with gangbusters profitability, resilience, balance and progress written across the results. .\nThe Tools Group. Organic sales down 1.4%, but making continuing progress and maintaining the strength of the network. C&I sales up 3.9% organically. OI margins of 16.7%, up 180 basis points at another high, significant sales and profit gains in custom kits and precision torque, confirming that we can roll out the Snap-on brand out of the garage successfully and very profitably.\nAnd finally, RS&I, sales up 1.6%. OI margins of 26.6%, a rise of 150 basis points, representing another record, all driven by the promising and powerful quarters of software and committed RCI. It all came together for sales of $1,198.7 million, an increase of 0.2%, return to positive territory. The overall gross margin was up 140 basis points to 49.7% and the OI margin was 22.1%, up 50 basis points, yet another record.\nWe are encouraged by the quarter and by our prospects going forward. Notwithstanding continuing uncertainty. We believe our markets will remain resilient and robust, reflecting the essential nature of the critical tasks that define them. We believe we've not only maintained but have expanded our considerable advantages in product and brand and in people, even as we proceeded through the turbulence. We believe our Snap-on Value Creation processes do deliver value every day, day in and day out. We believe our capable team really is a difference maker, battle tested, enabled to wheel advantage to consistently create positive outcomes, overcoming obstacles. It's happened over and over, and we have all been witnesses.\nAnd we believe that all these positives will keep our enterprise moving forward, extending and continuing its positive trajectory throughout 2025 and for many years beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'm going to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. I've spoken today on the special nature of our enterprise, resilient, capable, determined, wringing progress from challenge, you are the principal authors of all that. For your success in moving our company forward, prevailing in turbulence and proceeding with confidence, you have my congratulations. For the capability and scale you marshal every day, on behalf of our team, you have my admiration. And for your unwavering dedication too and strong belief in the future of our corporation, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our second quarter, and I'll provide my perspectives on the results on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter -- of course, there were challenges uncertainty remain prominent among our technician customers but our Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, with repair shop owners and managers and our commercial and industrial or C&I group, enabling critical tasks outside the vehicle shop.\nThey both progressed very nicely, taking full advantage of their opportunities and balancing the tech turbulence and tools. So our results in the second quarter are clear and unmistakable demonstration that Snap-on's principal value creating mechanism, observing work right in the workplace, using the insights learned to create products that make critical tests easier and more efficient, that works across many industries in many environments. It highlights that our enterprise is not dependent on a particular customer base.\nWe believe, it shows that as we move forward, reaching higher we do so with greater resilience and with expanding possibilities and with an enterprise that's broader and stronger than ever before. Like most quarters, we did have headwinds, we had opportunities with disparities from group to group and geography to geography, North America remained mixed with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were varied but reflected overall positive. Europe showed some signs of recovery among the scattered economic disruptions from region to region and the Asia Pacific markets registered progress overcoming the delayed recovery in China.\nSo now let's talk about the results. Second quarter sales of [ $1.1794 billion ] was slightly down from the [ $1.1913 billion ] of last year. on an organic basis, excluding $5.7 million an unfavorable foreign currency and $7.3 million from acquisitions, our sales were lower by 1.1%. The OpCo operating income or OI margin for the full quarter was 23.8%, up 50 basis points.\nNow with that said, that level included the benefit of a final payment from our recent legal win, excluding that addition, the OI margin was 22.8%, down from 2023, but still among our very best to pass the only by the recent -- by the record-setting second quarter of last year. For financial services, the OI grew to $70.2 million from the $66.9 million recorded in 2023. A number that when combined with our OpCo results, raised the consolidated OI margin to 27.4%, up 60 basis points over the 26.8% of 2023 and EPS, it was $5.07, which included a benefit from the legal payment of $0.16. Again, excluding that legal item, EPS was $4.91 still above last year and representing a new Snap-on level for any quarter, strength and progress against the wind.\nSo those are the overall numbers. Now for a view of the market. The second quarter once again highlighted that the opportunities in automotive repair, they continue to be favorable, marked by the ever-expanding complexity of design, new and diverse powertrains. More interlocking systems to advance driving autonomy, arrays of drive by wire sensors, new body materials and an aging car park now averaging 12.6 years. The opportunity in vehicle repair exists industry-wide and they appear to be unwavering. The vehicle OEMs, the dealerships and the independent shops recognizes the positive trend, and they continue to invest in tools and equipment that will expand their capabilities to support the influx of new models and the ever rising complexity of repair. And in the quarter, our RS&I Group expanded our reach into OEM dealership -- into OEM dealership programs and strengthened our position in independent [ correct ] with our payer management software packages and with great new hardware products.\nSo the possibility, with repair shop owners and managers are strong, the outlook looking forward is quite positive and Snap-on is well positioned to seize the opportunities. Now let's shift to the technicians. These are the folks who turn the wrenches to make the diagnosis and execute through again this quarter, I had multiple occasions to meet with the franchisee garage owners and the tech and it reconfirmed that the shops and the technicians are prospering. The micro data says it's true, repair hours are up. Tech wages are healthy. The demand for tax is strong and the number of techs are increasing. The number of tax is increasing. It makes sense, new systems, the rising complexity, the aging car park makes what the tests do more difficult and more valuable.\nSo the economic trajectory of vehicle repair is quite positive. It's an attractive place to be. But it's also clear that while the techs are busy and have cash, their confidence in the way forward is still poor. Every day, there's bad news. Two wars with [indiscernible] site. The border unsettled. The shipping lanes erupted, tit for tat with China, lingering inflation and the election, the election seems to get more on to do with every morning news cycle that hits just keep on coming for bad news for Bristol. It's almost like the grand sweet technicians have a fear of what may happen. And paraphrasing the movie done fear is the outlook pillar.\nThe franchisees also confirmed to us that with general uncertainty, the techs are leaning toward purchases that provide quick paybacks, while making the work easier right away. They're kind of cool on longer-term bigger ticket items. Knowing that, the Tools Group continues to focus on near-term product development, manufacturing changes and selling efforts that match those preferences. So now let's talk about the critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of garage, solving tasks of significant consequence. This is where the C&I group operates. And it's our most significant international presence. The area where we're most subject to global headwinds, but the news was still reasonably encouraging. For the sectors, the critical industries kept rising in the period, the military, aviation and education segments led the way.\nFor geographies, Europe was mixed. Several countries in recession and the ongoing impacts of the Ukraine war. Asia Pacific will also remain mixed. China was weak, driven by delayed financial recovery and Southeast Asia, again, had its difficulties. But -- both regions for C&I and for the corporation in total, were positive in the quarter despite the variations. Now speaking more than, now I'd like to speak more about the critical industries, the demand for customized solutions to drive reliability and productivity keeps rising. And C&I continues to show significant and broader advantage in that arena, and we believe there's more common. So that's the market, vehicle tech cash-rich but confidence poor. Preferring quick payback products. Repair shelf owners and managers moving upward to match the car park and the critical industry is booming outside the garage.\nIn C&I, so let's cover the groups now. In C&I, sales were $372 million representing an organic sales gain of 1.2%, excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of an unfavorable foreign currency. Higher activity with customers based in those critical industries and the gains in Asia -- and a gain in Asia that defines the turbulence more than offset clients in our power tool and European-based hand tool operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I OI of $62.2 million include $4.1 million or 7.1% above last year, and the OI margin, it was 16.7%, up 70 basis points representing a new record for that group [indiscernible], gangbusters for those guys. And the big driver was our International division. Continuing its upward trajectory with a double-digit rise and varied strong profitability. About 18 months ago, we expanded our capability to make more easier outside the garage by adding another building for the industrial -- for indugrial custom kitting, serving a range of critical segments, and it's paid off, it's paid off big.\nSince then, that business has been on a tear, [indiscernible] cranking out more and more bespoke product bundles, sophisticated solutions like our automated tool control units that have become the standard for a range of industries. Custom kit offerings aimed at specific applications and at making the critical work easier and more reliable. It's driven some nice gains all around the world. And we believe we see many more possibilities in that arena. So we continue to invest in critical industries, expanding capabilities like in our custom to machine in Kenosha, producing low volume, high reward items, for the most essential tasks.\nFor example, using an oil drilling site. We saw that adding a section of pipe on the rigs requires technicians to move around the circumference constantly repositioning the turning tool. It's a slow and clumsy and imprecise effort. Our custom team tackled the problem designing both a new bespoke -- a new bespoke ranch, both designing a new bespoke branch, specifically for the task and enabled by our new [indiscernible] machine shop configured a special machining process to produce it, and it all worked.\nThe special oil rig pipe wrench, greatly reduced the rework associated with misalignment and substantially decreased the past time, getting the job done more efficiently and more reliably and along the way, expanding the Snap-on reputation in the critical oil and gas sector. Also in the quarter, we introduced a new line of 14.4-volt micropower drills aimed specifically at diverse applications in aviation and general manufacturing. Test in all sectors vary from inserting wood screws, the drilling accurate holds and airframe, to high volumes on production lines. To span the each tool in the new line and is a range of them is set to a different RPM range, enabling the tech to fit the speed to the job, substantially reducing rework or irreversible damages -- damage. The drill -- it's also designed for 2 operating states, the first slower. Allowing the tools to bite into the materials, securing a position for the serious drilling and the second stage, performing that serious drilling at the predetermined RPM, making a quick and clear cut.\nOur new industrial micro drills, 2-stage design, matched to the past, bringing new levels with accuracy, consistency and reliability to the work. It's a superior tool for the very path of those sectors, and the customers have noticed C&I in the quarter, launching customized solutions, maintaining its strong momentum in the critical industry, extending out of the garage and reaching new heights in profitability.\nNow for the Tools Group. Sales in the second quarter are $482 million included an organic decrease of 7.7%. The group's OI margin in the period was 23.8%, down 250 basis points due to the lower volumes. But gross margins held down 20 basis points, almost flat, the benefits of new product manufacturing efficiencies and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, is written all over those numbers. And during the quarter, we continue to focus our product development, redirect our plans and guide our selling programs toward innovative quick payback solutions that drive productivity.\nA cornerstone for the pivot is really in customer in our customer time side-by-side with the technicians observing the work, witnessing the difficulties, a modern and complex repair and using the insights and to create a tool that makes especially difficult tasks much easier. In the second quarter, those insights lead the tool group to design a new torque adapter for use on Ford E-Series commercial vans. The standard procedure for basic brake repair on that model, requires the recaliber boats, we torque at over 160-foot pounds, not so easy.\nAnd the task made doubly difficult because the bolt is obstructed, making it impossible to access the area with standard tooling without removing a parts, a big time year. So we've specifically configured a 21-millimeter, 12.6 inch flat adapter with a half inch drive to make the work easier and specification. The device nestles perfectly. Between the particular obstructions on the model, engaging fastener, turning a time-consuming task into 1 of just sectors and freeing the tech up to tackle the next repair order. It's made in our Elizabeth and Tennessee plant, and it brings great value to the techs working on the E-Series.\nAnd you know there's a lot of them. Another example is the still observed when we observed when removing a canister tap that houses the fuel filter on 4 Super Duty trucks. Access to the 32-millimeter hectare on top of cap is impeded by other components. Standard part or sockets are out. Seeing the problem. Our team created a special low-profile socket, tapered, gradually, just the slide into position under the blocking hoses and then using a standard ration and extension, easily moving [indiscernible]. Complete the repair and complete the repair, a complicated job made much easier. Produced in our Milwaukee plant, it's another quick buyback item that makes a substantial difference and the text a lot of it.\nA final example comes from observing technicians walking to and from the workpiece, Back and forth to achieve standard flyers for basic test. A compact design seemed to be the solution. So we expanded our triple joint flyer line to develope a small 4.5-inch fire set with 3 models, a combination along those in a flank drive slip joint version for versatility and they were all pocket size to be always at the ready, call it out of your pocket and you're ready to go. And all designed to allow immediate access to remove low torque in place to pull through users, to adjust hoses.\nOr provide some additional gripping leverage for basic repairs or just inspections. The new units save steps and make work easier in tight spaces and they're offered in 2 handle models. A cushion grip addition to reduce hand fatigue and for the first time, our bare metal diamond plate texture that provides a superior grid even with sweaty or oily hands. Cold forge in the U.S., the new pliers a game changer. And the rollout was a huge hit, making our million-dollar hit product status just during the initial launch. Well, that's the Tools Group.\nPivoting to technicians preferences, producing innovative, quick paybacks, making work easier, New tools matched to the task and guided by customer connection, bringing quick value to the text, and you can see the value play out in the gross margins, bringing quick value to the tech. And you can see that play out in the gross margins, almost flat in the downturn. You can also see, I think, our unwavering support for the franchisees and the operating expense. It was about flat even in the turbulence, even in the downturn, even with the lower sales. We'll maintain our training, our programs and our efforts in the field.\nEven in this turbulence. You see, we believe the uncertainty will recede, and we want the network to be strong and fully loaded when that occurs. Now for RS&I. Group sales of $458.8 million in the quarter, representing a $4.3 million or 1% organic increase that was partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Those gains reflected higher activity with OEM dealerships attenuated by lower sales in the diagnostics division, BOI margin, it was an even 25%, rising 60 basis points and among the group's best. The numbers reflect the strength of RS&I products and programs for repair shareholders and managers as we help them match the evolving challenges of the [ Merin ] car park.\nSpeaking of the product evolutions and our progress with OEM pores. The traditional method of lifting vehicles is becoming more complex with the onset of new hybrid and EV platforms. The batteries require changes in lift points to adjust for the different center of gravity on EVs. And to complicate the matter. Each model design presents a different problem. In response, we designed steel floor plates matched to particular models that service guides and positioning the vehicle in the exact location that puts the lift arms in the proper place for that vehicle, enabling a safe procedure and an easy lift.\nThe OEMs and the shops, they enthusiastically seen the innovation as another a long line of the modifications needed to match the evolving car park. They need to facilitate to match that change, and we're helping them do it. Another successful and I release was the [ ProCaX1HD ] on vehicle breakage, specifically for heavy-duty planar like buses fire engine and semi truck, delayed cuts away in perfections and abrasion on a brake -- imperfections abrasions on a brake rotor surface that always arise during regular operations.\nThe result is a fully restored component that supports optimized brake performance without the need of a replacement. The previous choice for heavy-duty break repair work was the disassemble of break assembly or and either order new parts or smooth the road or on a stand-alone [indiscernible]. In either case, a laborious process. The new ProCut design avoids both the time and the effort to lift the heavy cones off the vehicle and it eliminates the cost of new parts.\nWe believe it's another changer. Garage owners have seen the value, and we project that the ProCut will become the industry standard. Also in RS&I, C&I, a car aligner serves the vehicle collision market serves the vehicle collision market. Serves the vehicle fusion market with a number of heavy-duty items. A good example during the quarter is the release of our low profile frame bench innovatively designed holding the workpiece at at an optimal height, making it easier for technicians to interact with the damaged vehicle.\nThe bench is rugged for heavy collision work and integrates with our existing policy solutions that stretch and can torque the chassis back in position. The ability to raise and lower the benches in multiple positions while still engaging with the vehicle reduces fatigue with the user and makes the process much easier. The collision space is quite robust. By the changing vehicles. And Carline has been on -- and as such, Carline has been on a continuing positive trajectory. And the new bench makes our advantage of that market even stronger. RS&I expanding its res, which shop owners and managers, confronting the increased complexity, focusing on developing innovations that simplify the difficult and help shops prosper along the way. Well, those are the -- for along the way. Well, those -- the RS&I quarter was quite strong.\nWell, those are the second quarter results, Tools Group down impacted by uncertainty, pivoting to customer preference, launching new product, holding the gross margins and maintaining the network. C&I and RS&I providing the multi-sector power of customer connection and new product recording strong profitability, balancing the headwinds of technician uncertainty and the overall corporation. Launching a broad range of products from tapered sockets to industrial power tools to collision benches, sales about flat, OI margin, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal benefits, one of our highest and EPS $5.07, $4.91 excluding the legal item setting a new high. performance achieved against the wind. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo.\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of [ $1.1794 billion ] in the quarter compared to [ $1.1913 billion ] last year. Reflecting a 1.1% organic sales decline and $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales activity was similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be dampened by afflicted technician confidence, our sales of repair shop owners and managers, again increased year-over-year.\nEncouragingly, activity with customers serving the critical industries remained robust. Consolidated gross margin of 50.6% compared to 50.7% last year, reflecting the lower sales volumes largely offset by savings from the company's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 26.8% compared to 27.4% laser. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.2 million benefit for the final payments received associated with the legal matter.\nThe 60 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payments, partially offset by the effects of lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $280.3 million in the quarter included a benefit from the lead payments compared to $277 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.8%, including a 100 basis point benefit in the legal payments compared to 23.3% last year.\nFinancial services revenue of $105 million in the second quarter of [ 2024 ] compared to $93.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $350.5 million, which includes a legal benefit compared to $343.9 million last year.\nAs a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 27.4%, including the legal payments, compared to 26.8% in 2023. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6% compared to 22.9% last year. Net earnings of $271.2 million or $5.07 per diluted share, including an $8.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payments compared to $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $372 million compared to $364.2 million last year, reflecting a 1.2% organic sales gain and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit reduction in the power tools operation, the latter mostly associated with lower intersegment sales.\nWith respect to critical industries, defense-related sales are strong as it was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.7% in the second quarter from 39.5% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 150 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 60 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $62.2 million compared to $58.1 million last year.\nThe operating margin of 16.7% compared to 16% in 2023 and and represented a new milestone of achievement for the segment. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $482 million compared to [ $523.1 million ] a year ago. reflecting a 7.7% organic sales decline and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. And now [indiscernible] last quarter, the organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin of 48.8% in the quarter declined 20 basis points from 49% last year, and that's primarily due to sales -- lower sales volumes. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 230 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 22.7% in 2023, largely due to the effects of lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $114.8 million compared to $137.7 million last year, the operating margin of 23.8% compared to 26.3% in 2023.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $454.8 million compared to $452 million in 2023, reflecting a 1% organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.\nGross margin improved 50 basis points to 45.5% from 45% last year. primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.5% improve 10 basis points from 20.6% last year. And the operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $113.6 million compared to $110.4 million last year. The operating margin of 25% compared to 24.4% reported last year.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.1 million or 7.6% to $100.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.8 million from 2023 levels including $3.5 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses was lower by $1.3 million. In the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the second quarter of '24 and '23, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively.\nTotal loan originations of $308. 1 million in the second quarter represented a decrease of $18.2 million or 5.6% and from 2023 levels, primarily reflecting a high single-digit decline in extended credit originations, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables. Consistent with the sales activity in the Snap-on Tools Group, extended credit origination to the U.S. declined and were only partially offset by growth in originations internationally.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% is up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2023, but down 20 basis points sequentially from the 1.8% reported last quarter. Turn 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $58.6 million represented [ 2.9.4% ] of outstandings at quarter end.\nConsidering the current environment, we believe the delinquency in portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable and are consistent with pre-COVID experience.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.1 million in the quarter represented 108% of net earnings compared to $270.3 million last year. The increase as compared to the second quarter of 2023 largely reflects decreases in working investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $60.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $41.2 million and capital expenditures of $23.2 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $127.9 million included cash dividends of $98 million and the repurchase of 174,000 shares of common stock for $47.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $271.1 million of common stock under our existing authorization.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $7.8 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days were unchanged from year-end. Inventories decreased $40.9 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of [ $1.2327 billion ] compared to [ $1.15 billion ] at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing out. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aldo. Wow. That's our second quarter. A period of continuing turbulence borne out of the uncertainty in the grassroots detect, uncertainty on the near-term environment. Customers tech that are cash rich and confidence poor. But it was also a period where our value-creating mechanism observing past right in the workplace, connecting with customers and translating the insights in an innovation that can make critical tasks easier where that core of our business model demonstrated that if efficacy stretches well beyond our traditional customer -- technician customer base and it does so quite profitably.\n[indiscernible] It was an interlude in which our Snap-on value creation processes showed its ongoing strength, particularly visible in the Tools Group, where it drove product value and operating efficiency that buttressed gross margins that stayed close to flat despite the lower volumes. And you can see that written all across the quarter. The [ Bols ] Group, an uncertainty driven decline in volume, continuing and continuing and unreduced support for its franchise network. But with profitable quick with profitable quick payback products keeping gross margins at reasonable levels, offsetting some of the volume impact. RS&I, seizing the opportunity to help shop owners and managers, matching the rising vehicle repair complexity and doing it very profitably, achieving an OI margin of 25% one of its best C&I rolling out of the garage to -- in critical industries overcoming the recessions in Europe and the turbulence to grow in each theater, continuing the upward trajectory of its customized kitting business driving expansion in critical industries and achieving an OI margin of 16.7%, up 70 basis points, its highest ever.\nAnd it all came together for a positive performance for the overall enterprise. Sales about flat against the uncertainty. OI margins, [ 23.8% ] -- 22.8%, excluding the legal payment, one of our very strongest and EPS, $5.07. And $4.91 without the legal payment, the highest for any Snap-on quarter. It was an encouraging period. And we believe that with the strength of our business model, with the opportunities inherent in our broad markets and with the considerable and harm experience of our team, Snap-on will remain resilient in the turbulence, making the most of it is the abundant possibility to markets and we'll continue to advance making progress through 2024 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know a lot of you are listening. The strength Snap-on has demonstrated in the turbulence and the associated advantages we carry into the days ahead have been created by all of you. the considerable capabilities you bring to bear every hour to have my admiration. For the significant success you've achieved in the quarter and for many periods before, you have my congratulations. And for the unwavering belief you hold in the future of our team, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nWe have on the call, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Although will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.\nAny statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.\nFinally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. We believe that our first quarter once again demonstrated Snap-on's ability to maintain its strength to engage headwinds, to manage challenges and to leverage the multiple opportunities of our markets.\nLooking at the results in total, we are encouraged. Like most quarters, we had turbulence from geography to geography and from operation to operation. North America was mixed, but with significant gains in critical industries Internationally, our consolidated results were also mixed, but yielding overall positives as our operations in Europe and Asia overcame the effects of recessions in Europe and the delayed recovery in China.\nNow the results. First quarter sales were [indiscernible] about flat to last year. On an organic basis, excluding $6.7 million from acquisitions and $2.5 million from favorable foreign currency our sales were lower by 0.8%. OpCo OI was $270.9 million, an increase of $11.1 million and the Opco operating margin for the quarter was 22.9%, up 90 basis points. Now both those numbers benefited from the legal payment referenced in our release. But with or without that legal flow our first quarter Opco OI and the margin were among our best. It's a strong statement given the turbulence of the day.\nFinancial Services. Operating income grew to $68.3 million from last year's $66.3 million, and the results combined with Opco to raise our consolidated operating margin to 26.5%, up over the 25.6% recorded last year. And EPS, it was $4.91, including a per share benefit from a legal payment of $0.16, but up $0.31 or 6.7% from last year. So those are the numbers.\nNow let's turn to the markets and the trends we're seeing as we connect with our customers. From an overall perspective, we believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. Vehicle OEM and dealerships continue investing in tools and equipment, preparing for the tie to new models, bringing the latest technology and drivetrains to the market. And in the quarter, our Repair Systems & Information Group, or RS&I, as we call it, expanded our reach into OEM programs and took advantage of the opportunities throughout its global footprint. And as we look forward, we see further prospects for RS&I capitalizing on that trend supplying dealerships and independent garages with just the products they need to confront the wave of modern platforms that are coming. So the shops are strong.\nNow let's speak of a technician. The guys in gals the ranch has punched the keys or tap the screens. This quarter, I have multiple occasions to visit with franchisees. And the report was generally that shops are humming, the bays are running at full capacity, and all that mirrors what the macro data says naturally. The car park is continuing to age. Now at an average of 12.5 years, and I think moving up. technician wages are rising and their hours worked, they're increasing. We believe it all signals ongoing and robust demand for repair.\nAnd you know what's true. The activity is strong, but there is a difference between the industry overview and the technician outlook for the future and by extension, their purchasing sentiment. The barrage of bad news, inflation, towards the border, the Red Sea, the election, the Iran bomb*ng for the people who work, the fear of what's coming around the corner impacts the outlook and paraphrasing the characterism of doom, fear is the outlook killer.\nIt erodes confidence. Techs are well positioned, and they continue to invest but it's a quick payback items that will make a difference right away but don't require a long-term payment stream. And in response, we're continuing to redirect -- we continue to redirect the Tools Group focus in our design efforts and our facility capacity and our selling and marketing efforts, working to match the current customer preference. So that's the auto repair.\nNow our commercial and industrial group or what we call C&I, serving critical industries in the most international of all our groups. And in the quarter, C&I manages the difficult challenge of balancing multiple economies that are in economic turbulence. Europe now has more than half a dozen countries in technical recession. And then China -- in the China environment, including the nearby countries, depending on it, they continue to struggle. India on the other hand, it's booming. Modi has the train running. So that's a positive in Asia amidst some very difficult economies. So that's the geographies.\nNow let's focus on the sectors. Areas like aviation continue to be strong. You don't have to read the paper very long to realize there's a significant focus on aerospace production and repair where the price for failure is high, and that arena is increasing demand for our precision tort products and for our asset control solutions to improve safety and productivity.\nIn addition, in that sort of critical arena, custom kits, matching a set of items to a particular task. It may it's an important business, especially for the military, both domestically and internationally. And with that, Critical industries is a substantial opportunity, and we are investing, expanding capacity, adding new products either organically or through the acquisitions we made over the last few years worth fortifying our runways for growth, extending outside the garage, and we know it's paying off.\nSo overall, the quarter was favorable despite the headwinds, Tools Group, pivoting, RS&I expanding with OEMs, C&I extending beyond the garage solving the critical. And the Opco OI percentage demonstrated once again the power Snap-on's value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection and innovation and rapid continuous improvement, developing innovative solutions that are born out of insight and observations right in the workplace. This understanding melded with RCI, helps snap on to once again hold fast in the turbulence of the day.\nWell, that's the macro overview. Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I group, sales were $359.9 million, representing a decrease of $3.9 million or 1.1%, and that includes $6.7 million in acquisitions, acquisition-related sales, $1.4 million in unfavorable foreign currency and an organic decline of 2.5%. It all reflects higher activity with customers in critical industries, more than offset by weakness in Asia Pacific and in our power tools.\nFrom an earnings perspective, C&I Operating income was $55.4 million. That was about the same as last year. The operating margin was 15.4%, up 10 basis points, and that was despite 30 basis points of headwind from currency and the acquisitions. Within the quarter, the demand for custom kits, addressing critical tasks remain nicely robust with increased demand for control solutions like our automatic tool control products.\nIt was a nice bright spot in C&I. On the other hand, power tools was down in the quarter, but help is on the way. Tuning power tool models born out of customer connection were recently introduced, each fulfilling specific needs for each fulfilling specific needs. For repair garages, we launched the PH3045B AirHamer. This is a tool that replicates the effect of swinging a hammer and hitting a sizzle except the device, hurdles the hammer 3,500 times a minute. Vehicles are filled with components like ball joints, wheel bearing, suspension bushings that are packed in tight fit for maximum efficiency.\nThis assembly can be a We know this from being in the garage. While with our new air hammer, the easy-to-use retainer securely holds a chisel in place while the piston sledge hammers away. It's powerful. But at the same time, the compact 2-inch barrel the 2-inch barrel enables the access in tight spaces, delivering tremendous power, speed and energy with unlimited run time. It's a real productivity enhancer, but the essential feature born out of watching the technicians in the shop is the best-in-class vibration reduction, created by special elastomer shocks, allowing Mechanic to pound away at these suspension components without fatigue or paying, no more store arms from Hammer work.\nThe new hammer was introduced late in the quarter and techs have already noticed. Also on power tools, our cordless portfolio expanded with the introduction of a new 18-volt nimbler designed for collision repair and metal fabrication. It's a big time saver. It speeds up work that once involve hand shears or other devices, help technicians cut any free-form shake conceivable, a lot of tough sheet metal. Again, the design resulted from customer connection from watching the tech struggle with shears. Our new nimbler makes a big difference when cutting in defenders extracting a damaged panel or cutting a ceiling of a car accommodating installation of a sunroof or creating a place anywhere in the vehicle for placing emergency lighting, shining away for first responders.\nI have to tell you, I have to tell you, we're encouraged by these innovative new products. And by all the others we're planning to introduce as the days go forward. We know work and they all will make a difference right away. C&I, a quarter confronted with international headwinds, strong momentum in domestic markets, led by critical industries, extending out of the garage with growing strength. Now let's talk about the Tools Group. The first quarter for the Tools Group was below our standard.\nHowever, we do remain confident, and we do see a pivot to focus on quick payback items registering a positive momentum and movement. Sales in the quarter were $500.1 million, including reflected an organic decrease, including an organic decrease or reflecting an organic decrease of 7%. The group's operating income margin was 23.5%, down 100 basis points. Notably, gross margin in the quarter rose 90 basis points, reaching 48.2%. You see shorter payback margins aren't shorter on profitability.\nDuring the quarter, we worked to redirect our plants, guide our franchisees to innovate solutions that drive productivity, and we kept engaging our customer connection, observing the task executed in the bay and using the insights to design and deploy innovative and focused products offerings that are dedicated to making work easier, like 2 new products, just engineers, just engineered to address time-consuming tasks where simple repairs are made complex by limited access made complex by limited accessibility or by size components that slow the work to a snails pace. You can see it in the garage.\nFor instance, on General Motors, 6L80 and 8L90 transmissions, the valve body bolts are obstructed by the exhaust set up, making it very taxing to do this job with a standard ratchet recycle combination. We were in some -- we were in some of those GM garages and observed the problem firsthand, classic customer connection. And the innovation that followed in our quarter-inch drive torques plus EPL-10 low-profile inverted socket. That's a mouthful. That innovation was released in the first quarter, and it does make GM transmission work easier.\nThe new Cushing design precisely the new custom design precisely maneuvers between the exhaust assembly and the transmission engaging the fastener in such a way that provides enough clearance for a ratcheting box or a box and ranch, hand ratches access the bolts for easy removal with no exhaust require saving more than 45 minutes per repair right away. Techs working on GM transmissions can complete more work with this device and make more money. They can do that right away, quick payback.\nAnother example we saw another example of that was we saw that removing the brake caliber pins on Toyota trucks and sports utilities was very difficult. Depends on 4 runners, Tacoma and tuners are exposed to harsh road environments, often causing the parts to become immovable regularly requiring like heat or excessive force to free the restricted fasteners. And each of those methods requires time and it raises the risk of damage to nearby components often elevating the complexity of the repair, taking a lot more time, watching the work.\nOur engineers produced a unique punch like bit that precisely aligned to an air hammer with the dimensions of the pin, maximizing the extraction force without endangering the surrounding systems. Once again, simplifying the task and freeing the tech to move on to other jobs. It's another quick payback item that's now available in popular.\nFinally in the quarter, we expanded our only -- the only U.S.-made locking flyer lineup by releasing 2 new models the [indiscernible] constructed with a tapered nose. It's ideal for additional reach inside compliance space to easily access narrow workpieces. And the new LP5WC delivering a reliable gripping power is difficult to engage round objects like hoses.\nBeyond the special features of those 2 models, the full line offers our sub 6-inch plyer line offers increased accessibility and -- because it's small enabling text to maneuver and crowded engine compartments and under the dash. The design also provides unmatched clamping forces, that locking pliers, unmatched clamping forces that will not slip under load with the locking mechanism. The plyers also serve as a second pair of hands. They're going to lock them up locking up, holding materials, securely in place, freeing up the technician's hands to complete another step in the repair. Each unit -- each of those locking plyer units is forged and produced our Elkmont, Alabama plant, and they're the only locking models made in the U.S.\nWell, that is the Tools Group, pivoting to match the technician's current preferences and needs wielding our customer connections, deploying solutions that improve efficiency by making tasks easier.\nNow RS&I. The RS&I Group's results confirmed, I think, what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, both dealers and the vast networks of independent shops. And in that regard, RS&I sales in the quarter were $463.8 million, up $17.2 million or 3.9% versus last year with an organic sales increase of 3.3%. Operating earnings for the group reached $112.9 million, reflecting an increase of $8.3 million or 7.9% versus last year.\nThe operating income margin was 24.3%, rising by 90 basis points, a powerful performance driven by OEM-related activity and sales in undercar helping shops prepare for new technologies. In terms of OEM-related activity and sales in undercar helping shops prepare for new technologies and enabling system upgrades in the growing collision market. We continue to seek to clearly see abundant runways for growth in RS&I, and we're working to take advantage One example of that is the launch of our new heavy-duty repair information software.\nThis package combines the vehicle interface capabilities of our heavy-duty diagnostic units with the horsepower of our Mitchell information database. It's an innovative solution for repair and heavy-duty industry, which over the past decade has seen an explosion of new technologies relating to sophisticated emission control along with advanced computer and electrical and at networks that all combines to present heavy mechanics with complex and complicated repair fast.\nNow the solutions now with solutions all located in 1 spot, tests can search by VIN number and access operating specification, troubleshooting tips and interactive wiring diagrams all be specific to the particular vehicle, all big time savers existing price was deployed in the quarter, and it's a groundbreaking integrated platform. The combined diagnostic capability together with vehicle information, it's very powerful.\nAnd I can tell you, the heavy-duty industry has noticed. You can see it in the RS&I numbers. And in the quarter, our Diagnostics division also released its latest 24.2 software upgrade, expanding our broad range of vehicle coverage and test procedures throughout all our existing hardware. The new upgrade strengthens our already market-leading data positions. Technicians get access to our SureTrack vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replaced parts, all derived from our proprietary database of 2.7 billion repair actions and 355 billion data records unmatched insight, not only to interpret what the vehicle trouble codes are saying but to uniquely use the information to determine the exact problem, analyzing millions of data lines per car, predicting the most likely repair.\nSnap-on uniquely provides this capability. And in this latest update, we continue adding new models and functionalities, making our proprietary software position even more effective and more powerful. We're confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers to make -- by making work easier with more and more great new products.\nWell, that's Snap-on's first quarter, sales flat, overcoming the significant headwinds, critical industries advancing, again, the tools group pivoting, matching the preference for quick payback products. OEM undercar repair information markets are remaining robust. The Opco OI margin, 22.9%, up 90 basis points and an EPS of $4.91, strong results that overcame the headwinds and benefited from a legal outcome. All demonstrating the strength in the midst of turbulence. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.12 billion in the quarter compared to $1.183 billion last year, reflecting an 0.8% organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\nActivity in our automotive repair markets was mixed gains in sales to OEM and independent shop owners and managers were more than offset by lower sales to technicians through our franchise van channel. Within the industrial sector for our C&I group, Sales to customers in critical industries were up mid-single digits in the quarter as compared to last year. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points from 49.8% last year, primarily reflecting benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.6% compared to 27.8% last year. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.3 million benefit for payments received associated with the legal matter. The 20 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payment partially offset by increased personnel and other costs, which includes a 20 basis point impact from acquisitions.\nOperating earnings before financial services of $270.9 million in the quarter, including the benefit from the legal payment compared to $259.8 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22.9% compared to 22% last year. Financial services revenue of $99.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $92.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023.\nConsolidated operating earnings of $339.2 million, which included the legal benefit compared to $326.1 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.5% compared to 25.6% in 2023. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 22.2% compared to 23.1% last year. Net earnings of $263.5 million or $4.91 per diluted share, including an $8.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payment compared to $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $359.9 million compared to $363.8 million last year, reflecting a 2.5% organic sales decline and a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to a double-digit reduction in the power tools business and a high single-digit decline in the segment's Asia Pacific operations mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. These declines were partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries.\nWith respect to critical industries, military and defense related sales were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 40.8% in the first quarter from 38.8% in 2023. This is largely due to increased volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector. Lower material costs and other cost savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from the benefit of acquisitions.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 25.4% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023 primarily due to the effects of lower sales volumes, investments in personnel and other costs and a 70 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.4 million compared to $55.8 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 15.3% in 2023.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.1 million compared to $537 million 1 year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales decline, partially offset by $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations.\nGross margin improved 90 basis points to 48.2% in the quarter from 47.3% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 24.7% in the quarter from 22.8% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $117.3 million compared to $131.7 million last year.\nThe operating margin of 23.5% compared to 24.5% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $463.8 million compared to $44.6 million in 2023 reflecting a 3.3% organic sales gain and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a low single-digit gain in sales of undercar equip.\nGross margin improved 150 basis points to 45% from 43.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 20.7% from 20.1% last year primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $112.9 million compared to $104.6 million last year, the operating margin of 24.3% compared to 23.4% reported last year.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million or 7.6% to $99.6 million from $92.6 million last year, primarily reflecting growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $5 million from 2023 levels, including $4.3 million of higher provisions for credit losses.\nIn the first quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the average yield on contract receivables were 9% and 8.7%, respectively. Total loan originations of $301.7 million in the first quarter represented an increase of $800,000 or 0.3% from 2023 levels. Increased originations of contract receivables were mostly offset by a low single-digit decline in extended credit originations.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables, with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% is up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2023, but unchanged from the rate reported last quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $54.1 million, representing 2.75% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up 16 basis points from the end of last quarter. Considering the current environment and despite these slight upward trends, we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $348.7 million in the quarter represented 129% of net earnings and compared to $301.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the first quarter of 2023 largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory during the quarter as well as higher net earnings.\nNet cash used by investing activities of $63.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $40.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $164.2 million included cash dividends of $98.2 million and the repurchase of 248,000 shares of common stock for $70.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs.\nAs of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $290.6 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.2 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 63 days compared to 60 days as of year-end and to 62 days as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nInventories decreased $35.4 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1.12 billion compared to [indiscernible] billion at year-end 2023. Our net debt to capital ratio of 1.5% compared to 3.8% at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance.\nI'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. With respect to corporate expenses, in the second quarter, we believe we could benefit from a legal payment similar to that received in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in a range of $100 million to $110 million, and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Well, that's the first quarter. Strength in the midst of colors. Even with a part of the enterprise below standard, you see Snap-on is a business that reaches varied customers in different industries and in various geographies united in a coherence that is the criticality of work, the essential nature of what we do.\nAnd we have the opportunity and advantage -- we have opportunity and advantage in virtually all of those arenas. And as a consequence, even when the largest of our entities is not a standard, we find a way in other areas to maintain overall strength. It's that coherent strategic breadth and the experience and capability of our team to execute that has made Snap-on so resilient, moving consistently upwards for all these years, and this quarter was another demonstration of that resilience.\nC&I, engaging economic challenges across geographies, extending to critical industries, proving that Snap-on can roll out of the garage, exploiting a considerable opportunity and do it profitably. The Tools Group acting to adapt, committing to accommodate the tech's certain outlook and their preference for quick payback products and doing it with still enviable margins. In fact, with gross margins up 90 basis points showing the promise of their pivot.\nRS&I seeing opportunities with repair shop owners and managers and making the most of it despite the challenges in Europe, volume and margins growing in a very imperfect environment and the credit company, working against the grain of short payback preferences and still raising profit. And it all came together to keep activity flat despite the difficulty to register an Opco operating margin of 22.9%, up 90 basis points and to record an EPS of $4.91, numbers that are among our strongest ever results with or without the legal benefit.\nAnd as such, we look ahead with confidence, fortified by our inherent advantages in our product, deep, wide and growing, solving more critical tasks every day, advantages in our brand. Snap-on is the outward side pride, working men and women taking their jobs and advantage in our people, committed, capable turbulence tested many times a team that knows how to ring the positive out of the difficult and fueled by those advantages, we believe Snap-on will maintain its strength, moving positively throughout the 2024 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates worldwide. The first quarter was a resilient and robust demonstration of Snap-on strength against challenge. And it all reflects your extraordinary effort to make it sold. For your contributions to the results, you have my congratulations. For the special capabilities you bring to bear on behalf of our team every day, you have my admiration.\nAnd for the unshakable belief you consistently display in our future, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter and our full year, and I'll provide my perspective on the results in our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. The results for our fourth quarter represented that we believe, another period of forward progress. Again, we had opportunities and countered headwinds and the shape of the variated landscape changed as it regularly does. But in the end, we once again took advantage of the opportunities and overcame the turbulence.\nSales in the quarter were $1,196,600 or $1.2 billion, sounds better that way, up 3.5% as reported from last year, excluding $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency and $5.5 million from the recent Mount acquisition. Organic sales increased 2.2%. The results represent a positive trend of some significance, demonstrating Snap-on's ability to adapt and to overcome market disruptions.\nFrom an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter was $257.9 million, and the OI margin for the quarter was $21.6 million up 10 basis points compared to last year. For Financial Services, operating earnings were $67.9 million, rising from the $63.9 million recorded last year. And the combination of the results from opco and from Financial Services offered an overall consolidated margin of 25.2%, also up 10 basis points. And the overall EPS was $4.75, a rise of 7.5% from the $4.42 that was registered a year ago.\nNow I talked about margins, let's turn to those markets and the trends we're seeing, based on our customer connections. We're with customers all the time. We believe automotive repair continues to be clearly favorable. Vehicle OEMs continue to see the need for upgrading dealer repair shops and enabling the shops and servicing the blizzard of new miles and technologies making the way to the market. And preparing for that future, OEM continue requiring dealership investments in new undercar equipment and essential tools to meet the challenge.\nIt's a considerable opportunity at which Snap-on is clearly taking advantage. Activity in the independent shops is also robust. You can see it in the vehicle and repair macros, car parks. The car park is growing and getting older. Now over 12 years old on here. Cars are getting more complex and more difficult to fix and reflecting all of that, service hours are up. household spending on repair is growing. Wages are rising. The number of technicians is moving upward fast and shopowners keep shouting, they want more technicians, even louder than they have over the past years.\nSo the underlying repair business is strong. It's prospering. It was a reality that kept the text positive even as the financial was champing over the past years and months, the recession is coming, the recession is coming. But cash isn't everything. Cash is in everything for the people of work. Personal confidence is a balance between your current environment, the garage we see and the way you see the world evolving in some time and sometime in the mid fall of last year, our franchisees sense that balance shifting negatively.\nIn recent weeks, I've been around, I visited franchisees all over the country; in Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, and they all said about the same thing. The techs are cash rich but because of the external bad news of getting for breakfast almost every day, the impact in the Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the dysfunction at the border and the uncertainty of the upcoming election, the weight of it all appears to be turning the tech's confidence poor. And when this happens, based on what we've seen in other times, we've seen it happen before, our customers keep purchasing, but they gravitate towards shorter payback items.\nAnd so it appeared to be as the quarter progressed. You saw that from mid to the end of the quarter. And so repair is strong, but the techs are worrying about the way forward, still cash rich, but they appear to be wavering in their confidence. This is a big change.\nNow let's move forward to critical industries. That's, of course, a bit different color. Confidence seems to be abundance across that business. This is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I plays. We continue to see progress. And again, the results in the quarter reflect that trend. It's a complex segment. A lot of you know this already, but I'm going to say the context, it's a complex segment embedded with essential techs where the penalty for failure is high. It's an arena that demands precision, functionality and repeatability, all under the most grueling environments, covering a vast range of applications from the sensitive micro world of chip manufacturing to giant rugged earthmoving equipment to performance critical aviation, things even up to spaceships.\nThe underlying need for customization -- but in that segment, the underlying need for customization and precision, both Snap-on strength is clearly growing all across those sectors. C&I is also the most geographically dispersed operations. And there's significant variations from country to country and created by the uncertainties in the economic political policies. As such, we see mixed results in Europe and a continuing but slow recovery in Asia. We also see differences from sector to sector with education, aviation and the military and general industries all showing nice improvements where natural resources and heavy-duty are off.\nBut shining through all that variability is our expanding strength in those critical industries. The advantage Snap-on holds in product and brand and in people. And in the quarter, those drivers were on display. So across our corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, turbulent from period to period and from sector to sector, but filled with ongoing opportunity. And we believe we're well positioned to face the challenges of today, though at the end of today and those that may arise in the future.\nWe remain confident that we have the continuing potential along -- we have continuing potential long-run run rates for growth, and we see significant power to overcome rooted in our Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer action innovation and rapid continuous improvement, especially customer connection. One of our substantial competitive advantages is being right where the actual paths are being pursued and in engineering the products to make the work easier by matching those insights, the insights gained with technology applied.\nWe've seen that over time, we've seen that innovative offerings create the path to advance and to overcome any turbulence. And in the quarter and in the year, our product line continued to advance, just kept getting stronger. And we continue to invest in Snap-on value creation to make that possible. We believe, in fact, that our product line has never been stronger. And despite the turbulence, we had more million dollar hit products in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2023 than ever before. and we believe we'll move higher again in 2024.\nNow let's talk about the full year, the 2023 performance. Sales of $4.7302 billion represented an increase of 5.3% as reported and arrived at 5.6% organically. Opco alone exceeded $1 billion. I'd say that again, $1 billion for the first time reaching $1.399 billion and our opco on margin of 22%, 22% represented an average increase, an increase of 110 basis points at gangbusters. We've never been at 22 and 110 is a great increase. And when we include financial services earnings of $270.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation year was 25.7%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share with the year were $18.76, rising $1.94 or 11.5%. We believe these are good numbers.\nNow for an individual -- for the individual operation. Now for the individual operating group. So let's start with C&I. Reported sales for the C&I group in the quarter were $363.9 million, up $20.7 million or 6%. That includes $5.5 million from the [indiscernible] acquisition, $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency and our organic sales increase of $11.6 million or 3.3%. They all reflecting the strength in critical industries, partially offset by a slide in automotive power tools. C&I's operating income for the period was $54.1 million. It was up 12.9% and the OI margin was 14.9%, rising 90 basis points and overcoming 50 basis points of headwind associated with negative currency.\nAgain, again, in this case, the advance was driven by strong expansion in critical industries. And our increased kitting capacity for complex orders continue to play a large role in that progress, but significant advances also spur as a regular is by new product. Innovations like our recently launched automated tool control or ATC portal, it's the latest addition to our unique Snap-on ATC tool control product lineup. It's manufactured at our AutoCrib operations that was recently acquired in California, and the portal significantly extends the reach of our ATC systems. It enables efficient control over a much wider range of device shapes and sizes. In effect, this portal's a doorway, in line with radio frequency identification or RFID antenna, and it's typically a place that the enters to tool.\nSignificant assets like hydraulic pumps, portable generators and valuable diagnostic equipment are often stored in common areas in factories or other places and enter a catalog by fixing an RFID tag. As technicians scan the badge is entering with the portal, the system documents the devices will be in and out of the secured stores, keeping close track of these critical items, just like the base ATC system keeps track of hand and power tools moving in and out of the tool storage box, but over a much wider set of areas. We anticipate that the new portal will be a big boost and a great opportunity for C&I in the growing area of tool control, a very important area for us. And in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that potential come to bear. So C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds but clear and overall advancement, great momentum enabled by capacity expansion and by growing product power.\nNow to the Tools Group. The Tools Group quarter, not at our standard. But we do see a path forward adjusting to the changing environment. As you may remember, this is where we sell to the text. Those who toil the wrenches, punch the touchscreen and those who appear to be wavering in macro confidence and those customers who under these conditions shift to lower payback or quicker payback items. While the fourth quarter reflects our franchisees and the Tools Group pivoting to match that movement, that customer movement. Sales in the quarter were $513.3 million included in our -- and they included an organic decrease of 5.7% compared to last year.\nNow more to our standard, group OI margins were 21.6%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 10 basis points of negative currency and the gross margin percentage rose to 200 basis points. Nice gains. As the quarter played out, the franchisee sense the change and redirected their ordering and selling focus to match the customer shifts to lower -- to faster payback items. And Snap-on is doing the same, defining a way forward, redirecting factory capacity, adopting smaller ticket marketing focus and launching innovative or quicker payback products that fit the environment. State-of-the-art designs, like our new ratchet for a manufacturer to Elizabeth, Tennessee factory. This next evolution in our ratchet line is 102 design. We've named the Synergy series. We believe it's a game changer for technicians, a significant improvement that helps make repair work much easier.\nThe Synergy is a short payback item that will make a clear difference right away, a 15% thinner head, an inch longer handle a 3.5-inch degree swing area, 20% more compact, all for easier access and quicker work in tight corners that they also come up like chassis areas in modern vehicles. Synergy's internal mechanisms were reengineered to engage the primary drag with 10 contact points versus the seventh in the previous design, greatly reducing the chance of slippage, improving the tools reliability and quality even while under maximum loads. Technicians may be uncertain about the way forward, but they're confident about the synergies. They know with the Synergy. They know it will provide a quick payback. It's thinner, longer, stronger. And going forward, we'll expand that new technology -- the new 102 technology throughout the Snap-on lineup, and we believe it will quickly become a must-have all across the industry.\nAlso in the quarter, our Algona, Iowa manufacturing facility to reach the new quick payback, KRSC2430, a 36-inch deluxe shop cart with its with smooth mobility and a substantial payload. It offers a technician economic an attractive way to start the tools but it also allows them to position their instruments adjacent to the workplace, increasing productivity, eliminating the time walking to and from the job. As a particularly special feature, the versal lid on this cart serves as a durable workbench when open separates into 2 sections, showing full and easy -- allowing full and easy access to the deep 8-inch top compartment that's underneath. The unit also includes a complete power strip where technicians charge their cordless tools, diagnostic platforms, lights and other electronic devices.\nThe innovative cards also configured with 2 additional jaws. There's kind of 2 additional drawers underneath the sliding top, providing quick accessibility for essential and small items preventing lost times from treasure hunting and large drawers or small-scale items. And it's a common problem with other units. And so this will really save time for the text. And like our top-of-the-line tool storage boxes, technicians can customize their cart, selecting from an array of colors and trims and so they can project their own personal identity throughout the shop. The KRSC2430 economical storage, attractive features convenient mobility, we expect it will have strong and continuing to appeal in this uncertain environment.\nAnd shifting the product focus also requires some repositioning in the factory. -- expanding the capacity to match customer preference, we're doing just that, moving to currently popular items, more dedication to short payback to products like our [ plexin ] swivel sockets and the new long nose pliers in Milwaukee, additional cart welding, breaking bottlenecks for our economical storage cart options in Algona and doubling down on synergy production in Elizabeth, Tennessee.\nFinally, our sales teams are being deployed to help franchisees, giving them added energy and more time in selling shorter payback items off their truck. Well, that's the Tools Group. Shifting tech preferences, pivoting operations to ensure the way forward, adapting products, capacity and sales focus, making the most of our strengths in the turbulence.\nNow for RS&I. The group results confirmed what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, dealers and independents and keeping pace with the growing complexity of the car park. RS&I sales in the quarter were $450.8 million, up $12.9 million versus last year, including an organic sales rise of $8.8 million that was authored by volume with vehicle OEM programs for new models and platforms and by strong progress in undercar for both dealerships and independent shops, gains that served to offset the decrease in the big-ticket diagnostic items. RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $113.3 million, and the operating margin was a still strong 25.1% but down 20 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to lower-margin under car and OEM facing and the OEM-facing activities.\nBut just like other segments, RSI advances are driven by new products. And even the aging car park is filled with diverse and ever-changing models. Light-duty trucks and full-size SUVs are bigger than ever requiring a range of wheel configurations and sizes somewhere over 100 pounds. And at the recent repair industry, SEMA show in Las Vegas, we had one of our answers to that challenge on prominent display. Our new automated armored wheeler series wheel balancers, specifically designed for high-volume shops that require precision and reliability made from robust steel for enhanced and rugged durability.\nEven a small compact footprint, the balancers intelligent operating system uses sonar technologies to automatically measure both the wheel and RIM, eliminating the need for manual intervention, a great time saver in the shop. And for improved safety, the unit also includes heavy-duty pneumatic for us that physicians cumbersome tires on the spindle, making it unnecessary, protects and physically lift or manipulate the heavy assembly, substantially avoiding is the strain. The balancer also includes the high resolution touch screen and an intuitive interface and an effective ergonomic design. It's a powerful combination of accuracy, speed, durability and safety and the SEMA crowd clearly noticed.\nSo that's RS&. Shop repair remains robust. Vehicle complexity continues to advance abundant opportunities for a great future. The group has abundant opportunities for a great future and our RSI team has the products to take advantage. Well, that's our quarter and our year. For the quarter, sales up 3.5% as reported, 2.2% organically. OI margin reached 21.6%, up 10 basis points, and the EPS was $4.75, rising 7.5% and against the turbulence.\nThe period was marked by extraordinary positives in the critical industry -- in the critical industries that are C&I. The Tools Group not reaching our standard, but displaying margin gains and pivoting to match the technician shifting focus and RS&I, enabling both dealerships and independent shops to meet the challenges of higher complexity in new technologies and the full year 2023 sales of $4.7302 billion, up 5.6% organically, an OI of over $1 billion rising 10.5% and OI margin of 22%, an increase of 110 basis points, 110 basis points like that. And EPS of $18.76, up $1.94 or 11.5%. It was another encouraging year.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.196.6 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.5% from 2022 levels reflecting a 2.2% organic sales gain, $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales were strong in our businesses serving critical industries this quarter while activity in our automotive repair market was mixed. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 48.5% last year.\nBenefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by the effects of a higher mix of lower sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points to 26.7% from 27% last year, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and benefits from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased investment in personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings before financial services of $257.9 million in the quarter compared to $248 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 21.5% last year. Financial services revenue of $97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $88.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $325.8 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.2% compared to 25.1% in 2022.\nOur fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to 22% last year, while our full year 2023 tax rate of 22.5% compared to 22.8% last year. Net earnings of $255.3 million or $4.75 per diluted share reflected an increase of $16.4 million or $0.33 per share from '22 levels and represented a 7.5% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $363.9 million increased from $343.2 million last year, reflecting an $11.6 million or 3.3% and organic sales gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries partially offset by a double-digit decline in sales of power tools.\nWith respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. As previously announced, during the quarter, Snap-on acquired Mountz Inc., a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of high-precision torque tools. The acquisition complements and expands Snap-on's torque offering for a variety of critical industry applications. The operating results of Mountz are reported within the C&I group.\nGross margin improved 150 basis points to 39.2% in the fourth quarter from 37.7% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector pricing actions, savings from RCI initiatives and the 30 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 24.3% in the quarter from 23.7% in 2022, primarily due to a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions as well as from investments in personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings for the C&I segment of $54.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $47.9 million last year. The operating margin of 14.9%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $513.3 million compared to $542.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline partially offset by $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in the U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations.\nGross margin improved 200 basis points to 45.2% in the quarter from 43.2% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products which includes lower sales of items where the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products made by our C&I and RS&I groups. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 180 basis points to 23.6% in the quarter from 21.8% in 2022, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $111 million compared to $116.1 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 21.4% in 2022.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $450.8 million compared to $437.9 million in 2022, reflecting a 2% organic sales gain and $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. These gains were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.\nGross margin was unchanged from last year with benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives, offset by increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 20 basis points to 19.9% from 19.7% last year. primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $113.3 million compared to $10.6 million last year. The operating margin of 25.1% and compared to 25.3% reported last year.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $8.9 million to $97.2 million from $88.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services and operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. The Financial services expenses were up $4.9 million from 2022 levels, including $3.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision.\nFor reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 8.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% and 17.6%. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $3.4 million or 1.1% from 2022 levels.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit was up from 1.6% in 2022, but was the same as in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 30 basis points, reflecting the seasonal uptick we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million represented 2.59% of outstandings at quarter end, which compares to 2.51% as reported at the end of last quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $296.9 million in the quarter represented 114% of net earnings and compared to $210.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory in 2023 as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million included $42.6 million for acquisitions, net additions to finance receivables of $42.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.1 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $149 million included cash dividends of $98 million and the repurchase of 217,000 shares of common stock for $60.9 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of year-end, we had approximately $22.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations available for repurchase.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $29.6 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $27.2 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our year-end cash position of $1.15 billion compared to $757.2 million a year in 2022.\nOur net debt to capital ratio of 3.8% compared to 9% a at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance, and I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. We expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Al. The Snap-on fourth quarter and full year. Geographic variation, shifting customer perspective, growing macro uncertainties, all overcome by Snap-on's ability to wield disadvantages making the most of opportunities, continuing its positive and upward trend now demonstrated over multiple quarters and a significant number of years.\nThe quarter did see the change in technicians perspective. And in pivoting with just the Tools Group volume did not meet our standards, but the tools team did blunt the difficulty with favorable mix and RCI driving improvement of OI margins up 20 basis points with the gross margin rising 200 basis points. The story with repair shop owners and managers was somewhat different. They recognize the need to upgrade and RS increase this rise in participation in OEM programs and extended its gains in undercar equipment, particularly in the expanding collision space.\nAnd finally, we saw C&I register another quarter of increasing importance to the corporation with the critical industries rising double digits and achieving another leap in margin reaching new margins, reaching new and significant levels. And it all resulted in a fourth quarter advancement against some substantial headwinds Sales were up 3.5% as reported 2.2% organically. OI margins of 21.6% increased 10 basis points and an EPS of $4.75 rising 7.5%, all representing progress and a time when all was not where we'd like it to be.\nBut I believe the bright-line story in this period is the full year sales for the corporation increased 5.6% organically. Opco margin rose 110 basis points, another significant advance and a long line of game reaching 22% for the first time, and the EPS was $18.76 up versus all comparisons. And it was all offered by some noteworthy performance of the Tools Group, not encountering the smoothest sailing but still achieving an OI margin of 23.6%, an increase of 150 basis points. RS&I, sales up 6.7% organically and an OI margin of 24.3%, up 70 basis points off a strong base.\nAnd C&I, facing a landscape of challenges. We're growing 4.2% as reported 5% organically with an OI margin of 15.5%, up 140 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. And perhaps the biggest story of all is the emergence of the critical industry business, growing strong double digits in all 4 quarters demonstrating that we really can roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage at considerable margins. We see the quarter in the year as demonstrating that Snap-on does have multiple run rates for progress. And if one of our segments is challenged, we can still move forward achieving clear and continuing advancement driven by the other parts of the enterprise.\nAnd as such, we're encouraged by our presence and by our future. We believe that with our advantages in product, everyone recognizes we know work and we do make tasks easier. In brand, everywhere you go, among the -- everywhere you go in the people of work, the Snap-on sign is displayed and spoken up with great pride. And in our people, a team, battle tested, who find the way forward and upwards despite the challenges, the results of 2023 say it so. And we believe, enabled by those advantages, Snap-on will overcome, we'll achieve and will advance continuing the positive trend throughout 2024 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll address our franchisees and associates. I know they're all listening. I've spoken today with belief and confidence on our current situation on our way forward. I do so principally, but I do so principally because I know the capability and the quality demonstrated over and over by all of you. For your contributions and authoring our achievements, you have my congratulations. For the skills and energy you bring to our corporation every day, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you consistently display for the future of our mutual enterprise, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions]. Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sarah Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aco, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a [indiscernible] series of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.\nAdditional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start by covering the highlights of the quarter, and then I'll provide an update on the general environment and the trends we see. Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. Speaking about the last 3 months, I can say without question or qualification, we are once again encouraged fortified by the progress along our runways for both growth and improvement. We encountered headwinds and we engaged challenges in a number of geographies. Still, we capitalized on our opportunities, wielding our advantage and overcame the potential for disruption. The franchisee network remained resilient, generating positive gains. So we're broad and sharp rises in critical industries, expanding what is now a consistent upward trajectory enabled by the confluence of a robust market, a growing product line and an effective expansion capacity in that business. And that progress was pretty evident in our numbers. They speak for themselves. Reported sales were $1.159 billion, up 5.2% from last year, a 4.7% organic rise and $4.4 million in favorable foreign currency effects with growth in every segment.\nThis represents our 13th quarter well above pre-pandemic levels. [ OpCo ] operating income OI before financial services was up 9.7%, reaching $245.2 million. OpCo operating margin rose 90 basis points to 21.2% with higher sales volumes, the benefits of great new products and the ongoing efficiencies of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, more than offsetting up 50 basis points of bad news from unfavorable foreign currency effects, 21.2% and 90 basis points, nice. The operating income for our financial services operation grew $69.4 million from the $66.4 million last year, a 4.5% improvement. And the result -- and that result combined with the OpCo performance to raise our consolidated operating margins to 25.1%, a 70 basis point rise from 2022. And EPS was $4.51, reflecting a -- or 8.9% increase above last year. Strong Well, those are the numbers. Once again, strong signifying our corporation's continuing events. You see, we again believe that Snap-on is stronger now than at any time in our history and the results, they say itself.\nNow let's review the markets. In vehicle repair, the key metrics continue to be [ fatal ], the average age of vehicles on the road, continuing to rise. And in turn, the number of techs in the garage -- in the garage is growing high to mid-single digits, maintaining a consistently positive trend period-period-over period. That's clearly upward. A technician wages are robust and continuing to climb. So the market is favorable and the metrics back it up. But more than the quantitative evidence, you get the feeling of optimism potential when you speak with technicians. Recently, I had the chance to visit with our customers, franchisees mechanics in New York. And I'm here to tell you the enthusiasm they displayed in the industry and the confidence they expressed in their future was something else. It was contagious. Even in this time of turbulence. The message was clear. They see opportunity and they're looking for more innovative solutions that will increase productivity and take advantage of that potential and their confidence on the way forward is palpable, and we believe they see Snap-on products, brands and people as the best way to ensure that positive future.\nVehicle repair is a strong market. We see this confirmed throughout the franchisee network in North America and in our international operations. It's one of the reasons we've expanded capacity. We believe our franchisees and our technicians have never been more prosperous. It all makes sense. The car park is increasingly requires more repairs or greater complexity. And our customers, the tax are major participants in that reality. They need -- and they need new tools to follow the opportunity. Snap-on is positioned to take full advantage of that possibility. Another important sector for us is the vehicle repair shop owners and managers. Standard -- these are people who stand right next to the text, but they buy at different cadences. This is where repair systems and information group or RS&I operates every day with Advantage. The vehicle park is changing. The shops have to keep adjusting model by model, new challenges -- new challenges that they have to navigate electronics to support more features, automotive systems that enhance driver safety, new body materials to increase durability and reduce weight, net worth of sensors to anticipate trapped and road conditions, new powertrains, enhanced internal combustion engines, EVs and plug-in hybrids to conserve energy and on and on and on.\nEach of these trends creates opportunity for garages and they know it. But they also know it requires new and more sophisticated equipment, the opportunity -- that opportunity we see shines right through political uncertainty or economic turbulence. We see through that and their needs every day when we call on the garages, new software to guide repairs or manage the shop, essential programs to accommodate [ edesyncrasies ] of new vehicles calibration protocols and advanced systems for sensor arrays, advanced undercar equipment to accommodate the precision that supports efficient driving. And we see the shop owners and managers eager to take advantage of those trends Snap-on has the hardware and software to enable that pursuit, bringing prosperity of the shops and the results in RS&I are confirming the strength of that market and our strong position in it. Finally, let's discuss the critical industries. This is where we extend outside the garage, solving tests that really matter. This is where commercial industrial or C&I lives and where much of our international activity happens.\nThis is the arena of critical applications, space declarations, wind tower maintenance, subsea mining, smelting that exceeds 2,300 degrees fahrenheit for aright the mobilization of first responders, all critical environments where the penalty for failure is high and the need for repeatability and reliability often requires custom tools engineered for a single purpose. In other words, task that require a Snap-on solution. Just like in previous quarters, the market is booming. Momentum in multiple sectors like the military, general industry, aerospace, heavy-duty and aviation. Of course, we do see variations from geography to geography. This is an international business. areas impacted by external factors that create disruptions in Europe with the uncertainty associated with the Ukraine war in Asia, where the remnants of the pandemic are still pretty apparent, there's turbulence in China, and the weakening of the currencies are these days are impacting particular countries.\nBut overall, the critical industries are robust. Offering us significant potential for taking advantage and making significant gains. And in the quarter, we did just that. So our markets are resilient and are on a positive trajectory, and we believe that our run rate for growth will present clear and abundant opportunities as we move forward, enhancing the franchise network, expanding repair shop owners and managers extending to those critical industries and building in emerging markets. Rising and going forward, by leveraging our broadening product line, welding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of the Snap-on team. That's the market. Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group, third quarter sales reached $366.4 million, up $9.6 million, which includes $1.6 million in unfavorable currency effects an organic sales growth of 3.2% above last year. From an earnings perspective, C&I's operating income was $58.1 million, up 11.1%, double-digit including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. And the operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 120 basis points overcoming 70 basis points of negative currency.\nWe did have some variation across the group -- across the group business units with the substantial gains in Industrial Division, offsetting declines in the Asia operations. But as usual, the C&I rise showed the power of our Snap-on value creation, particularly in customer connection and innovation, authoring great new products, solutions that make critical tasks easier, like our are CT 9038 power tool. We talked about this to the last quarter, saying that the franchisees were waiting for its launch, well, it was worth the wait. It's a special tool, a 3H-intrive, 18-volt impact unit that offers compact housing, measuring only 5 inches long. That's why we call it the stub. The unique silhouette is made possible by engineering the overall housing mechanism to stabilize the electric motor rather than the standard approach of adding a whole independent structure to support the drive components. It's an innovation that reduces overall body dimensions, allowing users to navigate really tight spaces. And believe me, that's an attractive advantage for engine and suspension work on newer vehicles. And it does that while still delivering 520-foot piles of bulk breakaway torque. Power capable of besting loose, even the most stubborn and seized fasteners -- it's what you would expect from Snap-on. It's ergonomically balanced greatly reducing user fatigue. It's equipped with a super bright LED light to clearly illuminate the workplace. It also offers three torque settings and forward and reverse and includes a variable speed trigger enabling text to apply just that necessary force avoiding the fastener damage that often can happen in tight spaces.\nSeptember was a big. Way oversubscribed. Clear testimony to the depreciation of the [ Stubb's ] Compact Power, and it's still showing great momentum. The orders remain very strong. It was worth waiting. C&I product is encouraging, but there's another story in the group. Our Industrial division, extending the Snap-on brand to the critical industries. We've said in the past that the opportunity was there, always needed was more capability to deliver. While it played out just that way. We did at capacity for kidding and it drove result expansion came in the fall of last year. And this past period was the third straight quarter of clear double-digit growth in the critical industry. And that was with strong margins. gangbusters, gangbusters margins, gangbusters growing. It overcame the C&I challenging in Eastern Europe and Asia. And we believe we have much more room to in the critical industries are. So we're adding more capability in that business right now to take full advantage. Well, that's C&I, substantial challenges overcome by strong products and expanded capacity to drive upward in the critical industries, and there's more to come.\nNow on to the Tools Group. Sales line was up organically 3.7% over last year, reaching $515.4 million in the quarter that finished with great -- in a quarter that finished with great momentum. And the group's operating income continue to move strongly upward to $113.4 million, an 11% increase, double-digit increase over 2022 levels, another in a series of those double-digit increases for the Tools Group. And the operating margin, well, it was 22% up 140 basis points from last year, and that rise -- and a considerable rise was achieved overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency, [ potful ] a great quarter for them profit. profitability and growth. Now the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, what we call it the SFC. This year, that was a natural with 9,000 people attend franchisees, guests and of course, Snap-on team, all participating in a weekend of special -- in a great weekend. It was a weekend of special training, hands-on with our massive product line and for some front -- for some fun -- special Snap-on celebrations were really good. The attendees had the opportunity to spend time ordering directly from the Expo Floor, and happy to say orders were up again this year. Which -- and that expo span the space of over 3 football fields where our entire portfolio of products was on display but it had a wide array of demonstrations that was specially designed to showcase the Snap-on performance advantage.\nThe conference also provided a number of training sessions. Helping franchisees expand their business seminars and special breakout highlighting our product features and unique advantages in critical categories like power tools and diagnostics, and we topped off that multi-day event. These are a celebration [indiscernible] coach buses, transporting the team to Downtown Nashville for unique Snap-on evening, Boom chakalaka was the word of the day. It was another memorable SSC, insightful education, great new products and a special fellowship, a special fellowship that reinforces our unique bond with our franchisees. From my perspective, our van drivers at Nashville spoke enthusiastically about their current businesses and radiated firm confidence in their future with Snap-on. And if you were there, you would have seen it too. During the tool Expo, franchisees were able to spend time interacting with some of the new innovative products derived from our customer connections. Insight gained directly in the workplace. Hand tools were big at the SFC in the quarter, and the demand was driven by specialty new products like our 12-millimeter, [ 6.6-liter ] DuraMax Globe plug socket. This product was inspired by a franchisee observing the technicians removing blocking components one by one, from a diesel vehicle fender well, special intake lines and steering shifts. These items create access fares, increasing the difficulty of executing the very basic repair of just changing diesel glow plugs, a routine task that was made difficult because of a crowded engine compartment designed with minimal regard for servicing.\nWe listened to the franchisee feedback, went to work in and designed a new socket, longer than the standard to reach the global from a distance. And with the flex mechanism to guide around the blockers making it unnecessary to remove them. Technicians immediately recognize the considerable time savings that -- and it made the new socket very popular. It's another customer connection that transformed the laborious process making work easier, freeing up time and increasing tech capacity and therefore, tech income. Also on display was another example of customer connection, the new FHC 72MPRR these product terminations are mouthful. Triple -- but it's -- we call it a triple function ratchet. Three tools in on, again, borne out of customer connection directly in the worst place. First, the ratchet head can be secured parallel to the handle serving as a traditional ratchet. Next, the head can be adjusted to take any one of 16 available positions, 240 degrees around the handle central line, enabling the tool to work while reaching around obstacles. Finally, the unit can be placed in a free spin mode, providing the tech with 360 degrees of continuous rotation, greatly reducing work time in low torque situations.\nOur customers, the technicians, again saw the great benefit of that improved productivity. And that recognition made the triple function ratchet, $1 million hit product in just the first month of selling. It was another win for customer connection and a driver for the Tools Group. The Tools Group Group's third quarter achievement and momentum, fueled by customer connection, innovative insight, anchoring great new products. And with the group's continuous dedication of Snap-on value creation, we believe the hits in the progress will just keep on coming. Turning to RS&I. Sales of $431.8 million in the third quarter were up as reported by 4.2% with an organic improvement of 3.1%. Expansions in the undercar equipment and our diagnostics and information portfolio continued to offset the OEM businesses where -- which finished down slightly in a traditionally lumpy arena. OI for RS&I was $104.9 million, up 10%, again, double digits from 2022. And the operating margin was 24.3%, which represented an improvement of 130 basis points, again against basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. We have great confidence in our SI business. Our customers and industry partners feel the same. And that confidence was demonstrated in the latest public recognition.\nRecently, Motor Magazine chose our ZEUS+ track Intelligent diagnostic platform as a top tool in 2023. Our premium handheld unit was recognized for simplifying the repairs, guiding technicians through the troubleshooting procedures, avoiding unnecessary steps along the way and improving solution accuracy and most importantly, reducing the time to identify the proper fit. The ZEUS+ is the top of the line for vehicle repair and the publications know it. Recognizing our handhelds new prominent bright screen increasing the ease of use in direct sunlight. It's faster processor with more onboard memory, enabling greater task efficiency. And it's improved labscope, making component testing much more accurate. And when professional tools and equipment news, I ask these readers to choose the best new tools as a recipient of that publications People's Choice Awards, the tech selected 7 Snap-on products led by the ZEUS+. The ZEUS+ top of the line and fees, hardware, software, shaped by customer tension, another in a long line of decisive RS&I products driving the group upward and onward.\nWe're quite positive about RS&I's possibilities with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves and the quarter supports that confidence. So those are the highlights of the quarter. Continued strong progress, the 13th straight quarter above prepandemic levels. C&I, margins up year-over-year volume growth and strong, strong OI margins. The Tools Group, great products, common franchisees and strong momentum. RS&I, undercar repair formation activity, leading the charge, enabling the repair shops and the challenges of today's vehicles and the overall corporation. Sales up 5.2% as reported 4.7% organically. OpCo operating margin 21.2%, up 90 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds and an EPS of $4.51, rising 8.9% versus last year. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.159.3 million in the quarter represented an increase of 5.2% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 4.7% organic sales gain and $4.4 million of favorable for currency translation. Organic sales growth was balanced across all three of our operating segments. And from a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year gains in North and South America as well as Europe. Asia continued to be attenuated by weakness in China and Japan, the latter hampered at depreciating in. Consolidated gross margin improved 160 basis points to 49.9% from 48.3% last year. As gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments. Contributions from increased sales volume and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RC&I initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 70 basis points to 28.7% from 28% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings before financial services of $245.2 million in the quarter compared to $223.5 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.2%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects reflects an expansion of 90 basis points over last year. Financial services revenue of $94.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $87.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $314.6 million in the quarter compared to $289.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1%, reflects an improvement of 70 basis points from 2022. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6% compared to 21.6% last year. Net earnings of $243.1 million or $4.51 per diluted share, including an $0.08 per share impact from unfavorable foreign currency, reflected an increase of $19.2 million or $0.37 per share from 2022 levels represented an 8.9% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $366.4 million increased from $356.8 million last year, reflecting an $11.2 million or 3.2% organic sales gain which was partially offset by $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries partially offset by a double-digit decline in the segment's Asia Pacific operations. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Overall, C&I organic sales to external customers were up 7.1% for the quarter. Gross margin improved 210 basis points to 39% in the third quarter from 36.9% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 90 basis points to 23.1% in the quarter from 22.2% in 2022, primarily due to increased sales and higher expense businesses and investments in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $52.3 million last year. The operating margin of 15.9%, including 70 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14.7% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 120 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $515.4 million compared to $496.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $500,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our international operations and a low single-digit increase in our U.S. business. Gross margin improved 140 basis points to 46.3% in the quarter from 44.9% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales was unchanged from last year with benefits from higher volumes offset by increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $113.4 million, including $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $102.2 million last year. The operating margin of 22% includes 50 basis points of unfavorable currency compared to 20.6% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 140 basis points. Turning to the RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $431.8 million compared to $414 million in 2022 reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a high single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. These gains were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in activity with OEM dealerships where we often see variability in essential programs from period to period.\nGross margin improved 260 basis points to 45.5% from 42.9% last year mostly due to lower material and other costs, increased sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 130 basis points to 21.2% from 19.9% last year, primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $104.9 million compared to $95.4 million last year. The operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.3% from 23% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.6 million to $94.9 million from $87.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $4.6 million from 2022 levels, including $4 million of higher provision for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision.\nSequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.3% year-over-year. And we believe the delinquency in portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022. The respective average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, average yield on contract receivables were 8.8% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $305.2 million in the third quarter represented an increase of $5 million or 1.7% from 2022 levels, including a 4% increase in originations of finance receivables. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit is the same as it was in this period last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the third quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $47.9 million represented 2.51% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up slightly from the 2.45% and reported at the end of last quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $285.4 million in the quarter represented 115% of net earnings and compared to $129.9 million last year. The improvement as compared to the third quarter of 2022 largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35.1 million and capital expenditures of $25.1 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $135.3 million included cash dividends of $85.6 million and the repurchase of 194,000 shares of common stock for $51.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $34.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $15.1 million from 2022 year-end. Net sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $200,000 from 2022 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turned to 2.4% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $959.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 4.8% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we entered into a 5-year, $900 million multicurrency revolving credit facility on September 12 and which amends and restates our previous $800 million facility.\nAs of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will approximate 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aldo. Well, that's our third quarter. I always say that third quarter could be somewhat squirly not always indicative of trends. And that's because of the SFC and the vacation seasons around the world. But having said that, the last 3 months have been encouraging. We took on some significant headwinds, the war in Ukraine and uncertainty in China, both politically and economically. We engage those challenges and came through it all with clear progress. New heights across the board, continuing our -- it all continue our upward trajectory, the upward trajectory, we've been on for some time. We've spoken quite a bit about capacity constraints. First in the industrial business and later in the Tools Group, one of the increasing demand for our solutions. And in this quarter, we can clearly see the power of such expansions wielded by a capable experienced team enabled by decisive advantages in product and brand and applied in markets that are critical and resilient even amidst the challenges.\nThe Industrial division is performing as we said with clear double-digit growth and strong profitability now demonstrated for three straight quarters as its new capacity come online. And the Tools Group starting to see the very early effects of that capacity propulsion, closing out the quarter with great momentum and with significant rise in overall profitability. At RS&I, not capacity bound, but establishing a strong and profitable position in the repair shop with software strength like our Mitchell1 system, diagnostic ascendants like our decorated ZEUS+ handheld and by clear answers to challenges of repair complexity up and down the undercar equipment line, continuing the steep upward trend in that broad product arena. This was an encouraging quarter. You can see it in the results. C&I sales, up 3.2% organically. [indiscernible] sales, particularly robust, significant gains in critical industries overcoming the uncertainty of Europe and Asia. OI margin of 15.9%, up 120 basis points to get 70, again, 70 basis points of unfavorable currency.\nThe Tools Group sales up organically, 3.7% close to target, exiting the quarter with momentum as the expansion start to help and an OI margin of 22%, up 140 basis points. Again, overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds. And RS&I, sales rising 3.1%, OI rising 10% and the OI margins reaching 24.3%, an uplift of 130 points. And all drove the corporation higher. Sales were up 4.7% organically. Overall, OpCo operating margins were 21.2%, a gain of 90 basis points 90 basis points against 50 basis points of bad currency. And all of that drove an EPS of $4.51, up versus every comparison. And we believe that with our decisive and widening advantages in product, the Snap-on Value Creation process, customer connection and innovation, keep -- we'll keep rolling out powerful new products day after day. Our advantages in brand, Snap-on remains the outward sign of pride and dignity that working men and women taking their profession. Everybody knows it's true. And advantages in people, our battle-tested and capable team, people that expect to rise even against difficulty.\nWith those advantages amplified by capacity investments and apply to resilient in critical markets, we believe that our enterprise will rise on a clear and continuing positive trajectory through the remainder of the year on into 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. My friends. This was an encouraging quarter. It was hard one against significant turbulence, and it was driven by your constant dedication and effort. For the success in our third quarter, delivered by your hands, you have my congratulations. For the extraordinary capability, you bring to bear every day in every situation, you have my admiration. And for the unwavering confidence you consistently express and clearly demonstrating the future of our enterprise and our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator.

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start the call by -- as usual, by covering the highlights of the second quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on the environment and the trends we're seeing. A long way we'll cover the markets. They're encouraging actually. And I'll take you through the segments and the advancements we've made. Then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. We see the second quarter as a period of significance. Sometimes you see a performance where our breakthrough to new heights. And this is one of those times. I'm going to tell you why we believe that to be true. In some ways, though, it was similar. This period was similar to many periods we've seen over time as we continue to have significant headwinds. And there's always turbulence variation from market to market. But we believe it's our job to confront and overcome these obstacles, and we did just that in the second quarter by [ wielding ] the strength of our advantages, executing on our strategic runways for growth, making the most of our runways for improvement and by relying on the skills and dedication of our people. And once again, it paid off the numbers screen it's sold but here they are.\nAs reported, second quarter sales of $1,191.3 billion were up 4.8% from 2022, including the impact of $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic activity was up 5.6%. The 12 straight quarter of year-over-year expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. That's a trend that demonstrates that we believe it is a solid consistency during pretty uncertain times. Now let's talk about the earnings. Earnings.\nOpco operating income for the quarter, including the effects of unfavorable foreign currency was $277 million, up 12.3% and our opco operating margin, the operating margin -- it was 23.3%, up 160 basis points from last year, BAFO. When I said new levels, I mean it. For Financial Services, the OI of $66.9 million represented an increase of $1.6 million, and it all combined to author an overall consolidated operating margin of 26.8% up 130 basis points from last year.\nAnd the second quarter EPS, it was $4.89, up $0.62 or 14.5% from last year's $4.27 . I think I'll say it again, $4.89, up 14.5%. The productivity and profitability of Snap-on operations shining through as the supply chain viscosity diminished. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than ever before, and the quarter's profitability makes that crystal clear. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's speak to the market, auto repair. Again, this quarter, it's favorable. Miles driven are up. Spending on vehicle maintenance, up. Technician count, up. Technician wages, up. Consistently positive year-over-year, consistently positive year-over-year trajectory across all the central categories. Drivers in vehicle repair are fairly understood car parks growing getting older every year, and every year, the tests involved in maintaining and repair the vehicle park get increasingly complex, requiring more hours, great scale, increased wages and more sophisticated tools, hands or power or data-driven tools. There's a significant need for more technicians and greater capabilities. The competition for that talent is growing, and it's being reflected in the rising wages at an everyday level.\nI think you can see this demand when you're trying to schedule a maintenance appointment or just by visually seeing one of the cars and trucks in the repair base or parked outside, crowded around the shops waiting for their turn to get in. And in fact, just this month with a group of franchisees and customers in Bristol, Tennessee, the NHRA Thunder nationals, the drag races, and they energetically expressed their enthusiasm during our conversations. You can feel their optimism of resonating with an appreciation for our products, our solutions and how we make work easier. So we expect that the trajectory of vehicle repair is solid. And we'll continue through the quarters and on into the years ahead, we expect that vehicle repair is the -- we believe that vehicle repair is a great place to operate and the repair information -- our repair information group and our Tools Group are well positioned to take advantage of that.\nNow on to the critical industries or our commercial industrial over, C&I takes our business out of the garage and solves to have a consequence where the penalty for failure is high in a wide range of sectors, where custom tools are often required to get the job done. This is also the segment where we have a most significant international presence and the attended variations from country to country with many versions of economic and social headwinds. In the U.S., the landscape actually is pretty positive. We see progress across a number of sectors. Aerospace is strong. Increased demand in commercial aviation and momentum within space exploration. The military business was another strong quarter of growth now better matching actual needs. Natural resources continue to advance in oil and gas and wind after the uncertainty of the last fall, energy repair is a positive place to be. Also begin the period with Industrial Transportation. Supply chain turbulence, I think, has raised the attention on rail and heavy-duty fleets, society now more than ever see the essential need to keep commercial supply moving and it's accruing positively for us.\nNow there are tepid spots across the globe. Place is traumatized by the Ukraine or we see that weakness in some of the agent Pacific operations. But one of the clear and large positives in the period is the general rise of critical industries. And our Industrial division is well positioned and it's taking advantage with this capability to customize products to a large number of applications, and it's working. Our critical industry teams are on an upward trajectory utilizing their capability and the enhanced capacity to capture -- the enhanced capacity to capture significant gains.\nOverall, the story of Snap-on outside the garage looks quite promising. And as we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on an abundant potential. And as part of that, we'll keep engaging Snap-on, customer connection and innovating, developing profitable, new profitable, new products and solutions delivered by the insights and knowledge gains standing next to the customers right in the work place and will drive RCI all over the enterprise, including in the Tools Group. We will keep working to increase our franchisee selling capacity with efficient processes with advanced training programs with social media and digital content and expanded manufacturing capacity to meet the rising demand, all combining to take full advantage of the opportunities and continue the positive trends we've seen into the future. Well, that's a market overview.\nNow let's move to the segments. For the C&I group, as reported sales rose 1.4%, including $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic volume was up by 3%. A quite strong performance in the Industrial division was attenuated by shortfalls in some of our more challenged areas. Power tools had smaller volumes as customers anticipated the arrival of new products in the third quarter, our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, but our Asia Pacific operations demonstrated growth in several markets, but softness in Eastern Europe and currency pressure in Japan and the yen was weak was some offset.\nBut our industrial vision isn't just growing in volume. The margins are strong and rising. Customized product is a wonderful thing. So C&I OI was $68.1 million, a 12.4% increase over last year. And the operating margin was 16% , one of the highest ever for the group, representing a gain of 160 basis points over the second quarter last year. The Industrial division wielding the capacity provided by our new building and [ Conoco ] registered significant sales progress. In April, we discussed the recovery of the military business in the military segment. In this quarter, we continued that momentum, capturing significant long-term contracts, our product line, wide and effective. produced in the U.S. made the difference. So we believe things look promising for the military business and for all our industrial segments.\nBeyond the Industrial division in C&I, our specialty tools operation continue to advance, meeting the need for precision with new torque products, covering a vast spectrum of clamping forces for challenging applications. Torq accuracy is rising in importance and Snap-on is ready to capitalize. We are confident and committed to extending in critical industries, and that conviction is anchored by the ongoing expansion of our lineup of innovative products, explicitly designed for particular tasks, offerings like our automated tool control or ATC enabled by proprietary digital imaging technology that scans toolbox, drawers, recording in real time, which tools are required are removed to replace. It's an increasingly crucial feature for aerospace for industrial manufacturing and for commercial transportation operations.\nImagine working out plan or a locomotive engine and unknowingly leaving a tool behind in the workplace. Not good, not good. This is a mistake that could result in a failure in any tight tolerance mechanism, one small item can be a huge problem. Well, ATC has an answer, keeping track of the tools. identifying missing items, tracing, who signed them out and where are they to be used and giving the all clear when everything is returned. So the plans can take off. Snap-on critical industries are on the rise and ATC is part of the reason. And in the quarter, we released our next generation of ATC, a larger touchscreen to improve the shop productivity and upgraded processes with the latest technology for seamless integration with any central IT system. And as you might expect, our customers were enthusiastic, sophisticated products for complex products. It's a winning combination for C&I, and you can see it in the quarter's results.\nNow on to the Tools Group. Organic sales grew 1.1%, which includes 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Growth in the international markets and a slight improvement in the U.S. network. Based on our franchisees and customer feedback, like I said already, vehicle repair is robust. But in the period, our record demand met capacity constraints before our plant expansion, so we're fully operational, limiting some of the potential possibilities and somewhat attenuating the volumes. But for operating earnings, payrolls in the quarter by $13.3 million or 10.7%, reaching $137.7 million. That's almost double the pre-pandemic level. The operating margin was 26.3%, a rise of 240 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. Let me say that again, Tools Group OI margin was 26.3%. [ Boomshakalaka! ] This is an eye-popping number.\nSo the Tools Group had another positive quarter with substantial profitability. We are confident in the strength of our van network and I believe is borne out of quantitative evidence, franchisee health metrics. We monitor them regularly every quarter. And again, this quarter, they remained strong. So what are you talking about talking to the franchisees at Thunder Valley or looking at the numbers, Vehicle repair does appear robust and continues to be so.\nNow when you think of the Tools Group, which is a pretty important subject this time, you think about hand tools, that high-margin lineup was -- they were -- that was up in the period. And new products led the way. One example of successful innovation that came from another customer -- customer connection was a number of franchisees observed that diesel technicians struggling to access sensors on Class 8 semi trucks that were struggling to do so to change the part without risking damage. The path had to be cleared by removing several other blocking components. Believe me, that's a time-consuming process. And so armed with customer connection insights, those customer connection insights. Our engineers developed an innovative design quickly produced a 3D prototype and confirm that it solved the problem. And that tool, the SWR 5 90-degree special crow foot [ trench ] is being made right now at our Elizabeth and Tennessee plant, and it's getting a lot of attention. It really does make proper easier. The techs love it, and we kind of like the margins.\nProfitable customer connection is one of the drivers behind the Tools Group success. And another example of this quarter is our 2-piece horizontal pushing adapter set. The BGP1BKS2, these names are something, text at a Subaru dealership where they were taking a lot of time to remove and store control arm bushings from suspension setups on the newer models. Our team assessed the procedure and designed 2 new adapters to integrate with our existing ball joint press, and that enabled the fit for the new -- a good bit for the new sub suspension and say 2 hours in repair time per procedure, that's a big savings in the garage generated by customer connection and innovation SNL a while ago, SNL's [indiscernible] said, it's always something. And it's true. There are always new repair challenges, whether the powertrain is internal combustion, plug-in hybrids or EV platforms. Vehicle architecture is getting tighter, packed with more devices, creating additional accessibility constraints, it's all music to our ears.\nOur franchisees and engineers observe the work, identify complications and simplify the complex and multifaceted tasks to raise efficiency and keep the world moving, and the attendant value is considerable. You can see that in the Tools Group profits. Now one of the highlights of the quarter was the continuing growth of our big ticket sales, a sign of technician confidence in the vehicle repair shop driving some of that trend. The latest tool storage unit, the KMP-1023ZLT7, a 72-inch master series roll can paining with a unique apparent scheme we call green envy, a break green body paired with black trim. It stands out and makes a statement in any repair shop beyond the eye-popping optics. The box is also a productivity enhancing powerhouse equipment 14 drawers, including 3 spanning the full width of the unit putting the most important tools of any size right in hand. It also offers our popular power drawer and dedicated space, equipment. You have 5 power outlets and 2 USB ports for charging a full array of core accessories. And for the hard to manage small parts, our 2-inch speed door, it makes for easy organization with green and color-coordinated dividers, custom slots for components of various sizes. The box is already one of our hit products. It really energized franchisees and was well received by our customers. And as I said, it helped keep the big ticket train moving. Well, that's the Tools Group, strong profitability, built on solid foundations of innovative products and franchisee success mixed with a considerable portion of RCI gain.\nNow visible as supply that RCI gain is now clearly visible as a supply chain turbulence receives. And the -- now , let's go on to RS&I. Sales as reported reached $452 million that represented a $35.2 million or 8.4% increase. Gains in the equipment and OEM essential programs paired with gains in equipment and OEM paired with our successful rollout of our new handheld diagnostic platform. The OI in the period was $110.4 million, up 14.7% or 15.4%. Up $14.7 million or 15.4%, and the operating margin was 24.4%, a rise of 140 basis points. Nice. Nice. As we said, the vehicle repair environment is strong, offering significant opportunity and the second quarter results for C&I says it's so. And the recent launch of our new [ Solus ], gone solars diagnostic platform was a big key to that success. Great new features. including a 2-second boot up, the fastest in the industry and an 8-inch colored touch free with 60% higher resolution, making it much easier for technicians to view in brighter lighting. It supports the latest communication protocols, and it offers access to SureTrack. That's our library of vehicle-specific real fixes repair tips and commonly replace parts that wheels our proprietary database of 2.5 billion repair records and 325 billion vehicle events, SOLUS, the franchisees have been positive, the customers have been excited and the sales have been robust.\nNew powertrains are driving the need for extending product lines, including vehicle lifts, enabling independent shops and dealerships to accommodate the new models. So -- and in meeting this opportunity with Advantage, part of RS&I success has been our undercar equipment division. It's one of the drivers between our -- behind RS&I's strong growth. Take our Challenger Lift Operation in Louisville. The plant offers thousands of SKUs matched a separate lifting desk and the numbers have been growing to meet the specific challenges of EV lifting. And in the quarter, that facility hosted Chief Executive Magazine's Smart Manufacturing Summit, and the event underlines the power of product customization and driving expansion and the extraordinary ability of RCI to render that low-volume production quite profitable. It's that approach that drove RCI's gains. OI up 140 basis points in the quarter and we expect that it will keep doing just that as we go forward throughout the group and all across Snap-on.\nImproving position with repair shop owners and managers, growing OEM relationships, expanding the product offerings, welding RCI everywhere, and it all combined to deliver substantial growth and strong profitability. The Snap-on second quarter, continued opportunities in vehicle repair and critical industries, progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, overall sales increasing organically 5.6%, margins strong every segment. Opco OI margin, 23.3%, up 160 basis points overcoming unfavorable currency and EPS $4.89, up versus all comparisons. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.191 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 4.8 from 2022 levels, reflecting a 5.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.3 million or 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. From a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year organic sales growth in North and South America as well as Europe, while sales in Asia Pacific were down low single digits, mostly due to weakness in the yen contributing to less activity in Japan. Consolidated gross margin improved 200 basis points at 50.7% from 48.7% last year as gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments, contributions from increased sales volumes and pricing actions lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.4% compared to 27% last year. The increase of 40 basis points is primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $277 million in the quarter compared to $246.6 million in 2022 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.3%, including 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, reflects an expansion of 160 basis points over last year.\nFinancial services revenue of $93.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $86.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.9 million compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $343.9 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.8% reflects an improvement of 130 basis points from 2022. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 23.8% last year. Net earnings of $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share, including $0.09 share impact from unfavorable foreign currency reflected an increase of $32.5 million or $0.62 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 14.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter.\nStarting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.2 million increased from $359.1 million last year, reflecting a $10.7 million or 3% organic sales gain which was partially offset by $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by declines in power tool volumes. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation and heavy-duty sectors. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 39.5% in the second quarter from 37.3% in 2022.\nThis is largely due to increased volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter, from 22.9% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses.\nOperating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 million compared to $51.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 160 basis points to 16% from 14.4% last year. Turning now to Slide 8.\nSales of Snap-on Tools Group of $523.1 million compared to $520.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.1% organic sales gain partially offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations and slightly higher sales in our U.S. business. Higher sales of hand tools and big ticket items in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales of Power Tools. Gross margin improved 300 basis points to 49% in the quarter from 46% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Material costs benefited from reduced expenses for various steel types used in our product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 60 basis points to 22.7% from 22.1% last year primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $137.7 million, including $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $124.4 million last year. The operating margin of 26.3%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 23.9% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 240 basis points.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $452 million compared to $416.8 million in 2022 reflecting an 8.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is comprised of a double-digit gain in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 45% from 43.2% last year, primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 40 basis points to 20.6% from 20.2% last year, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs.\nOperating earnings for the RS&I group of $110.4 million compared to $95.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 140 basis points to 24.4% from 23% reported last year.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million to $93.4 million from $86.4 million last year, reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $66.9 million, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $5.4 million from 2022 levels, including $4.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, Provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $13.7 million as compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter last year.\nIn the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, Provisions for losses were $11.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In addition, our gross worldwide extended credit of finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.1% year-over-year and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.5%. In the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively.\nTotal loan originations of $326.3 million in the second quarter represented an increase of $18.7 million or 6.1% from 2022 levels reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8.3% increase in originations of contract receivables. Gains in extended credit originations in the U.S. were led by franchisee sales of diagnostic products, including our recently launched SOLUS and ZEUS platforms.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.3% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.4% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $46.4 million represented 2.45% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.46% reported at the end of last quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $270.3 million in the quarter compared to $140.8 million last year. The improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working capital investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $94.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $68.6 million and capital expenditures of $25.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.5 million included cash dividends of $85.9 million and the repurchase of 359,000 shares of common stock for $94.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $336.7 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $25.1 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days was the same as 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $13 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4x compared to 2.5x at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $871.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 6.5% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aldo. Well, that's the quarter. RCI shining through as the supply sky is clear to show the new levels of performance. Vehicle repair continuing its strength, critical industry is accelerating RS&I growth, both in growth in both dealerships and in shops, advances in helping customize shops to new vehicles, OI margin, 24.4%, up 140 basis points. Tools Group growth attenuated. But strong new products, solving specific problems, creating extraordinary value and an OI of $137.7 million, almost double pre-pandemic levels and OI margins of 26.3%, up 240 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency. C&I extending in the critical industries. We're opening new capacity, achieving broad growth and an OI margin of 16%.\n160 basis points over last year, also overcoming unfavorable currency and Snap-on credit, profits up, originations rising indicating broad confidence in vehicle repair, and it came together for an attention getting overall performance. Snap-on organic sales rising 5.6%, an OI margin of 23.3%, up 160 basis points and an EPS of $4.89, new levels indeed. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe that these results, representing new heights highlight the opportunities in our markets. They're essential, demonstrate the power of our approach. It creates extraordinary value solving the critical. And most of all, confirms the strength and reliability of our team, capable and battle-tested reliability of that team to wield our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, all to overcome challenges and drive the corporation higher.\nAnd we expect that our decisively advantages -- those sets of advantages and opportunities and approach. And then people will author a continuing upward trajectory even beyond these levels throughout the remainder of this year, and on into 2024. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on team.\nI know many of you are listening. These results do represent new heights. But more than that, there are ringing testimony to your unwavering focus on moving our enterprise forward. Your extraordinary achievements, hard one.

Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sara. As usual -- good morning, everybody. Good morning. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of the first quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on what it all means. And then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. Along the way, we'll cover the markets. The robust gangbusters. We'll also give you a view of our momentum. It's been unbroken and vibrant.\nOnce again, the story of our quarter is continued resilience. Our ability to navigate the complex while knowing that with the flip of a calendar -- with the flip of the calendar will bring new challenges. You could pick up any significant publication or listen or watch any business show and you will encounter a variety of concerns, the measures of adversity and contraction. What we know, we can resist the difficulties. And so we have for the past 3 months and for quarter after quarter.\nYou see, we're armed with significant advantages. Our markets, displaying resilience born out of criticality, our brand standing above delivering quality and reinforcing personal pride, our products. They clearly move the world forward by making the critical easier. And finally, our people, our team, experienced, capable and confident. We are encouraged by this quarter, and I'll tell you why.\nOur reported sales in the period were $1.183 billion, up versus last year by $85.2 million or 7.8%, including $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales, they were up 10.2%, increases in every group, our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating expansion. Our opco operating income for the quarter was $259.8 million, including $7.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increasing by 16.5%. And the operating margin, it was 22%, rising 170 basis points over last year.\nFor financial services, operating income of $66.3 million compared to last year's $70.4 million. And that complies with opco -- and that combined with opco resulted in a consolidated operating margin of 25.6%, an 80 basis point improvement. In the first quarter's EPS, $4.60, up $0.60 or 15% from last year's $4. So we believe our confidence and our ongoing optimism is clearly justified by the numbers.\nNow let's look closer at our markets. The automotive repair environment remains hot. Demand across all disciplines. We continue investing in new products and accommodating the repair challenges of newer models, matching the increased complexity. As platforms change, the modification requires new tools to accomplish the task, and we're keeping pace, whether it's an internal combustion engine or an electric vehicles, the techs need an assist and we're ready to bring it.\nThe updates create a range of challenges, new challenges, from accessibility issues associated with combined spaces requiring new designs of varying geometries. The tighter engineering talent fueling the need for precision torque instrument to the increasing number of fasteners and listing our power tools to remove and install parts efficiently to the rise of drive by wire, more electronics. The more the electronics, the greater the need for handheld diagnostics and special software that can communicate with and manage the neural network of computers and sensors.\nWe're seeing strength in OEM dealerships. As new models break down to the market, new arrays of essential tools, equipment and diagnostics are needed to service the different and unique characteristics of each vehicle. For independent repair shops, business is booming. You're taking your vehicle in for service recently, you've witnessed this first hand, the bays are full and the parking lots are chockablock. And when I speak with our franchisees, they are enthusiastic, saying demand is robust. It's written all over the numbers. Garages are scheduled further out for shops of all types. Owners see the growth. They know they need technicians. And as you might expect, the rise in the tech count is substantial and the wages are moving up. And then of course, this is all music to our ears.\nWe believe that with the new vehicle models, the rise of automation, the growing need for precision and the increasing vehicle complexity, we may be entering the golden age of vehicle repair and our numbers say it may be so. So people repair. It's a great place to operate for our Tools Group and for our Repair Systems and Information Group, RS&I. And we believe it's only getting better.\nNow let's talk about the critical industries where commercial and industrial, C&I, take Snap-on out of the garage, solving tasks of consequences, representing our most significant international presence. It's an area where we're -- I suppose, most subject to global headwinds, but the news is still reasonably encouraging. The critical industries kept rising across sectors, aviation, education, heavy-duty fleets, general industry and natural resources, all up. And the military, once down, is now rebounding with high demand.\nAnd for geographies, North America was strong. Europe was improved, even in the face of ongoing -- of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the revenue disruption of the Brexit and Asia Pacific remained mixed, variation across the landscape. But overall, the critical industry markets of C&I showed significant and broad positives every sector. The first quarter is marked by substantial strides in that arena, and we see more opportunity on the horizon.\nWe believe there's abundant and ongoing potential all along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, leveraging our extensive product line, welding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the tasks, connecting to the customer, standing face-to-face in the workplace where the tasks are performed, observing the work, turning that insight into an innovative new products and some in the future for professionals. And we amplify that endeavor by applying a generous helping a rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, driving our productivity and our margin upwards. So that's our view of the market.\nNow let's turn to the groups. In the C&I group, sales of $363.8 million, including $12.5 million unfavorable foreign currency, increased 7% to last year. Organic sales were up 11.1% with double-digit gains in critical industries and specialty torque that precision leading the way. C&I's operating income of $55.8 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, represents an increase of 22.1% over last year, and the operating margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points from the 2022 level, promising numbers, right?\nC&I demonstrated considerable growth despite the ongoing uncertainty across geographies. One of the factors that's been attenuating C&I in the recent past was the impact of supply turbulence. The customize -- you heard me say it on the go, the customized kits with many different products are vulnerable to availability disruption. And one of the drivers behind the C&I rise were the improvements along the supply chain. During the period, we started to clean the log jams and reduce the impacts. The first quarter is evidence of that progress.\nFor some time, we've said that the demand in critical initiatives have been strong. It continued in the first quarter. And that positive is rooted in innovative products designed specifically for making a difference in critical paths. One example is our new ATech 1/4-inch Drive Flex-Head TechAngle Micro Torque Wrench, through a mouthful, but it's a great product. It's aimed directly at the aircraft repair where -- at aircraft repair with a necessity for torque precision is rising. The need for power is increasing and repair in tight spaces is becoming more common.\nOur new unit works on all 3 fronts. The new wrench is almost 1 foot long, but less than an inch in diameter. Configured to facilitate access deep inside engine compartments. It's also equipped with a 15-degree Flex-Head design, allowing it to avoid obstacles. And it uses our durable 72-tooth gear mechanism, enabling the tool to operate with small rotations when the barriers restrict motion, making it tough wrench. The new ATech has power, significant power, reaching 300-inch. It's expanding the range by 20% and increasing the number of applications that tool can cover. Consolidating tasks from multiple devices into one convenient unit and eliminating change over time, providing -- that's providing a nice productivity gain.\nThe unit has 4 alert modes, LCD, LED, vibratory and audible. Renting it -- those 4 prevent over torquing. Even when the visibility is low and the space is constrained. And when combined with the units accuracy plus or minus 2%, the feature serv to keep the fastening right on spec. The ATech accessibility, power and accuracy protects throughout the aviation sector, it's another hit product that helped drive C&I upward in this quarter. Well, that's C&I, on the rise, higher sales, stronger profits, powerful products and more to come.\nNow on to the Tools Group. Sales of $537.0 million, up $24.9 million, including $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency, registering a 6.3% organic gain with high single-digit increases in the U.S. and a low single-digit rise in the international network and the operating margin was 24.5%, up by 180 basis points against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. Boomshakalaka! This was a great number for us. We're really optimistic and encouraged by this. The vehicle repair markets are strong and resilient and it trades an ongoing path of abundant opportunity. And once again, the tools numbers back it up.\nBut beyond the quantitative evidence, I was just with some of our driver -- our van drivers last week. And their view was unconditionally positive. That's the only word I can use without equivocation or without question, they say shops are busy. All the product -- all our product lines are in high demand and their technician customers are brimming with confidence. It seems like the people of vehicle repair from top to bottom have great expectations for the way forward. And that positivity is evident in the continuing enthusiasm for big tickets, longer payback items, diagnostics and tool storage boxes. They continue to be major contributors to our results. You can see it in the success of the top of the line ZEUS+handheld diagnostic units. You can find it in the reception of our latest addition to the EPIQ tool storage lineup.\nThe 68-inch EPIQ limited edition box, toolbox. We call it the Neon Stinger. It's generated considerable excitement with its eye-catching look, a gloss black body with the newest color in tool storage trim, beyond how this -- I mean this baby pops, even at a less than bright light and say, the corner of a shop, of a tool store or a repair shop, it stands out to any place given the techs a chance to make a statement. And it's not just the glow. It also offers a range of powerful functionality. The speed drawer providing customizable organizations. A power drawer with securable charging space, and LED power top spanning the entire length of the box, fully illuminating the drawers and the tools making them shine like the jewels they are.\nThe Stinger, it also offers a 15 power outlets and 6 USB ports, all to ensure the tech -- cordless tools, lights and accessories are always charged and ready to go. I'll tell you, demand was strong and the Stinger was a Snap-on million-dollar hit product in a blink of an eye. So the Tools Group, robust demand in all product segments and the momentum train just kept running throughout the quarter.\nNow let's speak of RS&I. Sales reached $446.6 million, up $48.4 million or 12.2%, including $6 million in unfavorable foreign currency. Organic activity advanced 13.9% with double-digit increases in undercar equipment and OEM business is driving the game. 2 big contributors. RS&I operating earnings were $104.6 million, rising 14.2% over last year, and the operating margin was 23.4%, up 40 basis points. Again -- once again, this quarter, software products and subscriptions were a significant plus. Along those lines, our Mitchell 1 division responsible for providing repair information software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation by bringing great new improvements to shop efficiency.\nAnd this year -- an example is at this year's meeting of the heavy-duty technology and maintenance council in Orlando, which Mitchell 1 introduced our powerful wiring navigation features, specifically for trucks. It was immediately clear to large truck professionals that are new software would make it much easier and quicker for technicians to navigate the challenges of electrical issues on debate ever more complex vehicles, whether powered by internal combustion or battery cells. The feature makes a real difference. It's a significant aid to truck repair -- to the truck repair world, enabling quick transition from one wiring diagram to another following the wire without interruption between views. This is a significant time saver for the tech across the industry and the shops are noticing.\nMitchell 1 just released another great product. It's automated work package function for its collision repair software. The new system gathers into one screen, all the relevant information needed for collision jobs, overhaul procedures, illustrations and diagrams. All retrieved with the click of a button -- with one click of the button. One of the difficulties in collision repair is that the multifaceted nature of the task, you need part details, repair procedures, system diagrams, but that information is usually found in separate places in varying categories within the vehicle's documentation.\nOur new system combines the data into a single work package that guides the technician progressively through the effective repair. It sounds really simple. But in fact, the consolidated and comprehensive information eliminates the 20 to 90 minutes that's ordinarily needed to repair and effective guide for collision repair task. We believe the new software will be a big contributor to Mitchell 1 growth. It's a clear savings in an area that's rising in modern vehicle repair. With the increase of vehicle automation and the associated growth in sensor networks, [indiscernible] repairs increasingly more important, and our new feature is right on target to ease the way.\nWe keep expanding in RS&I. We keep expanding our RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more and more solutions for the day-to-day challenges, welding customer connection and innovation, to essential components of Snap-on value creation, processes to drive winning new software and hardware. We're confident. It's a successful formula and RS&I results reinforce that view.\nSo those are the highlights of our quarter. Continued momentum. Our 11th straight period of year-over-year operating growth. C&I is showing strength, gaining against the supply turbulence of the day. RS&I, remaining robust, rising with software and hardware. The Tools Group, a healthy and enhanced van network, aiming for more. Organic sales in the quarter, up 10.2%. Opco operating margin, 22% and EPS $4.60, up 15% over last year, a significant increase. It all adds up. It all serves to provide clear evidence and powerful testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the great withering on the COVID, stronger than when it entered and the enterprise is continuing that upward trend with capability and conviction. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo.\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Finance, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.183 billion in the quarter, increased 7.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 10.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter includes broad-based gains across all of the segments.\nFrom a geographic perspective, we experienced double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in North America and low single-digit organic gains in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 110 basis points from 48.7% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset the effects of higher material and other costs as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.\nWhile the supply chain environment has somewhat improved, we believe the corporation continued to navigate effectively costs and other challenges associated with the ongoing conditions. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.8%, improved 60 basis points from 28.4% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $259.8 million in the quarter compared to $223.1 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% improved 170 basis points from last year's first quarter.\nFinancial Services revenue of $92.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 5.6% compared to $87.7 million last year. Operating earnings of $66.3 million, decreased $4.1 million from 2022 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings was $326.1 million in the quarter compared to $293.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.6% improved 80 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.1% compared to 23.7% last year. Net earnings of $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share including $0.12 of unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency, increased $31.3 million or $0.60 per share from 2022 levels, representing a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I on Slide 7. Sales of $363.8 million increased from $340.1 million last year, reflecting a $36.2 million or 11.1% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in the segment specialty torque business as well as low single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business.\nWith respect to critical industries, the sales gains were wide ranging in the quarter. In addition to higher activity across general industry, sales to the military were robust as were sales to technical education, aviation and natural resources. Gross margin of 38.8% improved 240 basis points from 36.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This is primarily due to higher sales volumes including increased activity and the higher gross margin critical industries, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of higher material and other costs.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.5% in the quarter increased 50 basis points from 23% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.8 million increased 22.1% from $45.7 million last year. The operating margin of 15.3%, improved 190 basis points from 13.4% last year.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $537 million compared to $512.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 6.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. Sales in the quarter were up year-over-year in all product lines. Gross margin of 47.3% in the quarter improved 180 basis points from 45.5% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% were unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $131.7 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $15.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 24.5%, including 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, improved 180 basis points from 22.7% in 2022.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $446.6 million increased 12.2% from $398.2 million in 2022, reflecting a 13.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment and in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 43.5% declined 110 basis points from 44.6% last year, primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and the effects of higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from our C&I initiatives as well as 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 21.6% last year primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $104.6 million compared to $91.6 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 23% reported a year ago.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $92.6 million increased from $87.7 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $66.3 million, including $700,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.4 million in 2022. Financial services expenses of $26.3 million were up $9 million from 2022 levels, including $8.1 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision.\nFor reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the quarter were $14.2 million, as compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter last year. In the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, provisions for losses were $12.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. In addition, the gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 7.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to [ 0.8% ] last year.\nIn the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $300.9 million in the first quarter increased $55.3 million or 22.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 25.1% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.2% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable origination reflects the continued strong demand for big ticket products sold by our franchisees during the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.6% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 10 basis points reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the fourth and first quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.1 million represented 2.46% of outstandings at the end of the first quarter. While this was up 12 basis points from a year ago, it is 45 basis points lower than year-end 2019.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.6 million in the quarter compared to $193.9 million last year. The increase from the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, improved net earnings and lower cash tax and compensation payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $72.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $49.6 million and capital expenditures of $23 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $152.1 million included cash dividends of $86.1 million and the repurchase of 356,000 shares of common stock for $87.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $20.7 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 61 days at 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $16 million from 2022 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns 2.4% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products as well as critical industry projects. Additionally, to better assure availability given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts components and raw materials are up as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods.\nOur quarter end cash position of $833.8 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there are no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Snap-On, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aldo, for that detailed financial review. Look, well, that's Snap-on's first quarter. It is an encouraging performance, demonstrating clearly the breadth, the depth and the length of our extraordinary advance. The breadth, progress across each of the operating groups. C&I, gaining on the challenge of customized kits amidst supply turbulence and rising above the difficulties of geographic reach in troubled times.\nTools Group, continuing its upward trend, taking full advantage of the hot resilient vehicle repair market, reaching yet another margin high. RS&I, riding the wave of vehicle complexity and new model introductions, registering another quarter of powerful growth. The period was positive all across our enterprise. Our quarter also had depth. The record was strong from top to bottom, up and down the P&L. C&I, 11.1% organic growth and the OI margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points. RS&I, organic sales rising, 13.9% and OI margin, a strong 23.4%, 40 points over last year.\nThe Tools Group organic activity increasing 6.3% more in the U.S., high single digits. And we spoke of the eye-catching brilliance of the Stinger toolbox. Remember, I admit, it really pops, well, something else that pops is the Tools OI margin. It's something that catch attention. It pops like a neon sign, 24.5%, up 180 basis points, directly against 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. All that added up to strength across the corporation. Organic sales advancing 10.2%, up big, even in the uncertainty. OI margin, 22% -- 22%, representing a rise of 170 basis points.\nAnd the final tally of it all, EPS, it was $4.60, up by a clear distance over any comparison. And finally, our performance is marked by length, by the extended positive trend. It was the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating gain. The world is evolving as we thought it would. New equipment and software being needed to follow the acceleration of model change and new technologies. The vehicle repair market is looking like it's approaching a golden age, more technicians, wages rising, collective and individual optimism across the sector. And we sought our momentum extending in the quarter, a positive view that was confirmed by the voice of the franchisees. And moving forward, we believe that the momentum will continue. And we are confident -- we're confident that we're positioned to make the most of the abundant opportunities, growing and improving. We've done it period after period, and we did it again in the first quarter.\nYou see, we do have device advantages in our product, authored by customer connection and innovation, easing the way for critical path, making a clear difference with professionals. We have an advantage in our brand, marking the serious and the professional, bringing pride and dignity, like no other name. And we have an advantage in our people, our team. Challenge, tested and fully dedicated, and we believe the resilient markets and these considerable advantages will enable Snap-on to maintain its momentum and continue its rise into the second quarter throughout 2023 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I speak to our franchisees and associates, our team. I know many of you are listening. This quarter is encouraging, but those who would ask why or how, we only look all of you. For the considerable part you played in this performance, you have my congratulations. For the extraordinary commitment you've given to our team, you have my admiration. And for the unfailing confidence you hold in Snap-on future, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVP of IR, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThank you, Cole, and good morning, everyone.

Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Wow, it's been some year and quite a quarter. China knee jerking from zero-COVID and strict lockdowns to living with COVID in unprecedented virus explosion, diminished but still continuing spikes in the supply chain, the ongoing Ukraine war, the emergence of -- the reemergence of Brexit and now the rising shadow of the recession, echoing in almost daily public pronouncements. And thru it all, Snap-on delivered another in a long line of encouraging performances.\nWe'll go through it. Starting with the highlights of the quarter and the year, I'll give you my perspective on the results, the market environment and our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into -- as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.\nThe fourth quarter was encouraging. We believe it emphatically demonstrates the continuing resilience of our markets and the capability of our operations to achieve in the face of difficulty, wielding the power of our product, our brand, our people and our strategic position. It all combines to serve as clear evidence of what we already know. Snap-on is a unique and extraordinary operation. The results for the fourth quarter serve as more testimony to that fact, and they are an unmistakable demonstration of our continuing momentum. Of course, we did with the differences from group to group and within the operations, but we believe the overall results are compelling.\nFourth quarter sales of $1,155.9 million as reported, up 4.3% from 2021 included a substantial impact from unfavorable foreign currency of $37.7 million a 370 basis point headwind, and an organic sales increase of 8% over last year, and that represented a 22.7% rise over 2019. This now represents the corporation's tenth consecutive quarter above pre-pandemic levels. It's a trend of, I think, some significance in uncertain times like these.\nFrom an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter, including the impact from unfavorable foreign currency was $248 million, up 6.8% compared to 2021 and 44.7% above the 2019 pre-pandemic level. The OI margin for the quarter, it was 21.5%, improving by 50 basis points over last year and 360 basis points over 2019. It's the same resiliency that's been demonstrated over the years as we paid dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single interruption or reduction. In fact, in November, our dividend was raised by 14.1%, marking the 13th straight year of increases. It's more a testimony of Snap-on's consistent performance through varying environments. This is just another one of them.\nFor Financial Services, operating income of $63.9 million was down from 67 point -- $63.9 million was down from the $67.2 million in 2021. That decrease reflected the forecasted -- our forecast to return to more historical provision levels, but all the while keeping delinquencies flat to last year. And our overall quarterly EPS reached $4.42, $0.32 or 7.8% above 2021 and up 43.5% compared with 2019. Well, those are the numbers.\nNow to the markets. We believe that automotive repair remains very favorable. It makes sense. The average age of vehicles continue to increase. The complexity of repairs is rising steeply as new platforms enter the vehicle park, and enter they have, starting in dealerships. And we have seen a resurgence in dealership projects despite a still recovering supply chain. Changes in internal combustion, the rise of electric vehicles and the expansion of vehicle autonomy have made dealerships ego eager for new equipment to support complex repair test of the evolving vehicle park, and we see it.\nProjects in powertrains aside, dealerships continue to see healthy demand in repair and maintenance and in warranty, driving the need for shop expansion and more technicians. You can see it in the macros. Repair spending, technician numbers, technician wages, all up. Our dealership segment is expanding. And for independent repair shops, confidence remains sky high across the board. Shop owners and managers confirm that demand for repairs for technicians over complex skills are all rising, and our sales growth in that sector mirrors that enthusiasm. We believe we're moving into what we can be called the golden age of vehicle repair, and our Tools Group and RS&I Group are uniquely positioned with the product, the brand and the people to take full advantage, even in the midst of turbulence. You can see it.\nNow for the critical industries, where our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I operates. We continue to see progress but the group spans wide jurisdictions. And as such, various headwinds across the geographies and the industries have attenuated some of those gains. For geographies, Europe with the war and the reemergence of Brexit and China impacted by the COVID chaos were a stark contrast to relatively strong North American markets, a lot of variation. And the range in variability among sectors also continue to be a challenge. Natural resources, heavy-duty fleets, general industries and international aviations were robust, but the military area remain challenged. Overall, however, order demand for most of the critical industries has been strong, and we believe that's a great signal for C&I's future. So C&I does have challenges across geographies and the segments, but we have made advancements, and we see opportunities for tomorrow.\nGoing forward, we believe we'll keep moving down our runways for growth, our wide runways for growth. And as we proceed, we're also fortified, as all of you have heard before, by our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, RCI. They're the core processes that drive our ongoing progress, especially customer connection and innovation, growing our product line. You see, our franchisees and our direct sales force puts us in a strategic advantage, standing face-to-face with professional techs, understanding their individual challenges, showcasing the solutions created by our powerful product and demonstrating their use.\nOur resilient markets do represent a significant opportunity, and we are there to take advantage up close and personal, like no one else, right where the jobs are done. And it's working. 2022 was a year of substantial headwinds, but our team prevailed with the year achieving new heights. Sales of $4,492.8 million, up 5.7%, reflecting an organic gain of 8.7% compared to 2021 and a 20.2% organic increase versus 2019. The opco OI margin for the year was 20.9%, up 90 basis points from '21 and exceeding the pre-pandemic -- the pandemic margins by 170 basis points. As reported, earnings per share for the year were $16.82, up 12.7% from '21 and represented a rise of 35.5% from 2019. It's all evidence of the decisive and ongoing momentum that marked the year and the quarter.\nNow the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $343.2 million for the group were down $15.5 million versus last year, including $21.2 million in unfavorable currency and a 1.7% organic gain. Our Specialty Tools division was a clear positive with double-digit gains. Precision is becoming essential every day, and our torque products are putting us right in the middle of that rise. Our critical industries also showed strength, especially in North America, propelled by growth in natural resources, general and heavy duty, partially attenuated by lower military activity.\nOutside North America, it was a different story. SNA Europe was down and China was diminished. OI for C&I was $47.9 million, down $2.2 million primarily from the $2.3 million in unfavorable foreign currency. The group's operating margin was 14%. It was flat to last year, but still represented an advance of 120 basis points over the pre-pandemic level in 2019, and that was against 50 basis points of negative currency and acquisition dilution.\nThe specialty torque business within C&I really is making significant strides. Torque is hot, and Snap-on is a widening array of new offerings to prominently participate in that trend. Products like our new series of digital torque checkers. It's from our Norbar engineering team. You might remember we acquired Norbar a few years ago. Our Norbar engineering team in England, more compact and easier to use, it helps technicians validate the accuracy of torque instruments close to the workplace, saving a lot of time.\nOur new checkers accommodate torque measurements from 5-inch pounds to 1,500 foot pounds and rent is from a quarter inch to 1-inch covering jobs from precision fasteners and a jet cockpit to a heavy-duty bolt on a giant oil rig, a wide range of applications. And it's compact steel how they easily mount in a variety -- this is compact steel housing easily mounts in a variety of convenient locations at the point of issuing or in the pathway of the workflow, like tool cribs, aviation hangars and manufacturing cells, making torque checking an easy exercise.\nWith an accuracy of plus or minus 1%, our new checker increases process quality without work interruption, raises consistency in assembly activity and, with a streamlined documentation feature, greatly improves the management of fastening in any application. The initial launch was well received by any operation relies on precision torque, and there are a lot of them. And as you can imagine, the new checker is right on track to be a Snap-on hit product with sales of $1 million in the first year. So it looks like it's a pretty strong product for us. C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds, but it did have significant areas of improvement paving the way for future growth.\nNow on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $542.7 million, up $37.9 million, including 9.5% in unfavorable currency and a 9.6% organic increase, gains in the U.S. operation and continued expansion in the international networks. And it was all led by big-ticket items, tool storage and diagnostics both with [bagful] double-digit gains. Operating earnings for the Tools Group were $116.1 million in the quarter, $5.6 million above 2021, and that included $4.5 million in unfavorable currency. The operating margin was 21.4%, 50 basis points below last year, but that was impacted by currency and by product mix, but it was still a result of considerable strength.\nTools Group again represents the ongoing power and market leadership of our van network. It's written across the financials. And that positivity is clearly [and] boldly echoed in the voices of our franchisees. I can tell you, I was just at one of our annual kickoff. It's unmistakable that they're pumped enthusiastic and confidence. They know they are growing. And they firmly believe there's more to be had. And our franchisee health metrics confirm all of that to be true. The quantitative trajectory delays in that data supports every bit of the positivity -- of the positive attitude.\nAnd the franchisees expressed their excitement in more formal ways. During the quarter, we were recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which surveys franchisee satisfaction. And it's the latest ranking that publication, once again, latest annual ranking -- that publication once again listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 16th consecutive year we received that award. And internationally, Snap-on was ranked #1, #1 in Elite Franchisees Magazine's Top U.K. Franchises for 2023, finishing not only above the U.K.-only franchise systems, but also coming in ahead of the very popular global brand -- a number of very popular global brands. Now that type of recognition reflects, I think, fundamental strength of our brand business, and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products.\nAs part of that, Snap-on continues to lead the industry with great tool storage innovations designed to improve productivity and allow techs to personalize their workspace. We're the first to market with the LED power top, brightly lighting the greening Snap-on tools like special jewels as each store is accessed. It's quite a sight. It enables the techs to show the pride in their work.\nAnd building on that feature, in December, we started shipping the first of our new IRIS tool storage units. It's a 68-inch special edition epic Roll Cab, which allows the technician to adjust the draw lighting with an infinite array of color selections. It is an eye-catcher coated and [storm] great paint paired with red trim, and it also features -- besides its appearance, it also features for the first time a specially lit Snap-on logo nameplate. It's innovative, striking. And as for all epic boxes, all of them, it streams functionality. The power top and the power door provides 10 electrical outlets and 4 USB ports throughout the roll cab that ensures that all the cordless tools, the lights, the accessories are charged and at the ready.\nIt also features our unique speed drawer for smart customizable tool organization. It's a very popular and productive feature in the shops. Convenience, productivity and distinction, the IRIS received an overwhelming reception, helping to drive the landmark tool storage we had just in the fourth quarter -- landmark full storage quarter we had just recently. It shows that pride really is a powerful salesman. You show that every day. Well, that's our Tools Group, booming in the U.S. progressing internationally, continuing the stream of new products, building the brand, enhancing the brand channel and moving forward with momentum.\nNow for RS&I. In the fourth quarter, our RS&I Group results confirmed what we've been saying all along. Snap-on is well positioned for the ongoing rise in vehicle repair. RS&I sales in the quarter of $437.9 million increased 11.6%, including $9.5 million in unfavorable currency and a 14.3% organic gain, 14.3%, boom shakalaka. That rise was authored by -- it was a great performance, and that rise was authored by double-digit increase in OEM dealerships as manufacturers continue to release new models, invest in new equipment and then implement essential tool programs. But our business in the independent garages also expanded nicely with double-digit growth in our undercar equipment and in our diagnostics and repair information products, twin pillars of strength. Shop owners need upgrades to follow the changing car park, and they now have confidence regarding their futures to act on that imperative and Snap-on is ready to help.\nRS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $110.6 million, up 13.8%. And again, and the operating margin, it was 25.3%, rising 50 basis points over 2021, exhibiting our team's ability to navigate the turbulence, welding Snap-on value creation, connecting with customers, launching innovation executing RCI and doing what they're expected to do: keep raising profitability.\nOne example is our diagnostic business, double-digit growth, led by new products. Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our game-changing handheld diligent diagnostic unit, the ZEUS+. Well, it's selling at a record pace. It's hard -- in hardware and in software subscriptions. It's a great unit that again raises the bar for an advanced repair, providing technicians with a powerful health and troubleshooting and diagnostic the most complex of vehicle repairs. ZEUS+ makes those special challenges take up so much shop time appear quick and easy, and the techs are noticing. RS&I, the repair shops are confident seeing a great future, and RS&I has the products to pave their way.\nWell, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 8%, 10 quarters of consecutive growth from pre-pandemic levels. Tools Group, demonstrating strength. Organic sales up 9.6% over last year, rising 33.2% from pre-pandemic levels. RS&I products to meet the needs of the vehicles of today and of tomorrow, activity up 14.3% organically, gains in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, C&I showing potential for growth despite international headwinds, strong momentum in the critical industries with much more to go. And it all drove a 21.5% operating margin for the overall enterprise, rising 50 basis points from last year and an EPS of $4.42 up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,155.9 million in the quarter increased 4.3% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, partially offset by $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter reflects double-digit gains in the Repair Systems & Information Group, high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group and low single-digit gains in the Commercial and Industrial Group.\nFrom a geographic perspective, double-digit sales growth in both North and South America more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.5% improved 40 basis points from 48.1% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 10 basis points from 27.1% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $248 million in the quarter compared to $232.2 million in 2021 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.5% improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter.\nFinancial services revenue of $88.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $63.9 million decreased to $3.3 million from 2021 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million in the quarter compared to $299.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings margin of 25.1% was unchanged from last year.\nOur fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 22.3% last year. Net earnings of $238.9 million or $4.42 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.32 per share from last year levels, representing a 7.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $343.2 million decreased from $358.7 million last year, reflecting a $5.7 million or 1.7% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $21.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, gains in sales to heavy-duty fleets, mining and general industry more than offset lower activity with the military.\nGross margin of 37.7% improved 120 basis points from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, benefits from RCI initiatives and 20 basis point of favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher material and other input costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% in the quarter increased 120 basis points from 22.5% in 2021, mostly due to reduced sales and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $47.9 million compared to $50.1 million last year. The operating margin of 14% was unchanged from last year.\nTurning to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $542.7 million compared to $504.8 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. The quarter benefited from robust demand for our recently launched ZEUS+ diagnostic platform as well as our tool storage product line.\nGross margin of 43.2% in the quarter declined 70 basis points from 43.9% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of lower gross margin products and higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volume and pricing actions. As a reminder, the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products such as diagnostics, which is made by our RS&I Group.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.8% improved 20 basis points from 22% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116.1 million compared to $110.5 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 21.9% in 2021.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $437.9 million increased 11.6% from $392.5 million in 2021, reflecting a 14.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment in activity with OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, including those diagnostic sales affected by the Snap-on Tools Group.\nGross margin of 45% declined 110 basis points from 46.1% last year, primarily due to a higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 80 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.7% improved 160 basis points from 21.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $110.6 million compared to $97.2 million last year. The operating margin of 25.3% improved 50 basis points from 24.8% reported a year ago.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $88.3 million, including a $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $63.9 million, including $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $67.2 million in 2021. Financial Services expenses of $24.4 million were up $4.7 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $4.8 million of higher provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that the loan portfolio trends remain stable.\nFor reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $12.8 million as compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter last year, yet lower than the $14.1 million and the $16 million recorded in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.1% and 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.7%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year.\nTotal loan originations of $299.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $43.4 million or 16.9% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 17% increase in originations of finance receivables, a 16.7% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable originations reflects the continued strong sales of big-ticket items by our franchisees during the work.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The total global gross portfolio is up 3.4% year-over-year. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit was the same as in 2021 and compared to 1.8% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.8 million represented 2.44% of outstandings at year-end. While this was up 6 basis points from a year ago, it is 47 basis points lower than year-end 2019.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $210.6 million in the quarter compared to $222.7 million last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a 36.5% -- $36.5 million increase in working investment, partially offset by improved net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $67.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $47.3 million and capital expenditures of $22.7 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $145.8 million included cash dividends of $86 million and the repurchase of 284,000 shares of common stock for $65.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $362.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $79.4 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end and to 67 days as of the pre-pandemic year end of 2019. Inventories increased $229.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and the 2.6 turns as of year-end 2019. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products. Additionally, given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts, components and raw materials are up, as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods.\nOur year-end cash position of $757.2 million compared to $780 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 9% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter and our year. I would say we can characterize particularly the fourth quarter as a period where the hits just kept on coming: sporadic supply shortages, war, Brexit, lockdowns, virus explosion and a constant drumbeat of recession warnings that served up bad news for breakfast every day. You can also describe the recent path of the time when Snap-on clearly just demonstrated the resilience of its markets and the power of its businesses.\nC&I. engaging the full range of challenges across sectors and geographies but overcoming, growing 1.7% organically, registering an OI margin of 14%, flat to last year, reflecting the turbulence of the moment but up 120 basis points from pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group, big-ticket items surging, organic sales growing 9.6% overall, OI margin at 21.4%, up big from pre-pandemic levels, down from last year but primarily due to 40 points of negative currency and a similar impact from less favorable product mix. Still strong.\nRS&I, success in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, sales up 14.3% organically and an OI margin of 25.3%, up 50 basis points from last year. We said we're well positioned for the comeback and repair shops, and RS&I is showing just that. And the credit company, OI down, but finance originations growing a strong 17%, and all of it authored strong numbers for the corporation.\nOrganic sales up 8% versus last year, 22.7% versus pre-pandemic levels. OI margin of 21.5%, 21.5%, up 50 basis points compared with 2021 and 360 basis points over 2019. Full year organic sales were up 8.7% and the OI margin for the year was 20.9%, a rise of 90 basis points. And finally, EPS for the quarter of $4.42, up 7.8% versus last year and 43.5% versus pre-pandemic levels.\nThe hits did just keep coming, but Snap-on overcame. We exited the year stronger than when we entered, and we left the quarter in December with greater position and strength than we had in early October. We do have momentum, and you can see it in the numbers. We believe our markets will remain resilient, offer ongoing and abundant opportunities, and with our inherent advantages, the breadth and quality of our products. The unique and aspirational nature of our brands and the considerable capabilities of our experienced team, we believe we will maintain the momentum and extend our ongoing positive trajectory throughout 2023 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are listening. You are the people of work, the individuals whose contributions collectively fostered these results. As I look back over the quarter, over 2022 and, in fact, over the past 3 years, it's clear your efforts, as you met the justifiable fear with extraordinary vigilance, helped keep our society and our company from disintegrating while we engaged and prevailed against the COVID.\nWe often say that Snap-on people are unique, special and consistently make a difference. The past 3 years have clearly proved it so. For your ongoing achievement in the past quarter and many others, you have my congratulations. For your continued dedication in enabling the work of our society, you have my admiration. And for your confident commitment to Snap-on and its future, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

My name is Caroline, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded for the duration of the call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over the call to your host, Sara Verbsky to begin the conference.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVP of IR, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThank you, Caroline.

Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As you know I'll start the call by covering the highlights of third quarter, I'm going to give you an update on the environment and the trends we see. I'll take you through some of the turbulence we encountered thinking about (inaudible) Aldo will provide a more detailed...\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nHe got a better game see how well dollar tree. Apparently they were unhappy with them leave in advance.\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nStory of the Snap-on core -- Apparently, we have some cross-talk we're hearing here. But the story of the Snap-on quarter is momentum overcoming challenges. Momentum rooted in the resilience of our market, the capability of our experienced team and the tactical and strategic advantage in our product, our brand and our models, all coming together to create considerable and ongoing strength. In effect, the third quarter once again demonstrated our ability to continue a trajectory of positive results despite the headwinds, and the numbers they say it so.\nOur reported sales in the quarter of $1.1025 billion were up $64.8 million or 6.2% versus last year, including $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales grew 10.4%, with gains in every group, our ninth straight quarter of year-over-year expansion. And if you compare it to the pre-pandemic levels of 2029 -- 2019, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive versus 2019 sales were up 22.3% as reported and 22.8% organically, continuing our positive trend and accelerating our expansion, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day.\nI did say momentum. Quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, they all combine to offer significant progress. And progress to what? Opco operating income of $223.5 million increased $22.2 million from last year, and the Opco operating margin was 20.3%, up 90 basis points from last year and rising 170 basis points over 2019.\nFor financial services and operating income of $66.4 million compared to the $70.6 million of last year, a decrease reflecting the forecasted return to more usual provision levels. And that result, combined with OpCo for a consolidated margin of 24.4%, up 20 basis points from last year and 120 basis point improvement from 2019. The quarterly EPS, it was $4.14, rising 16% over the $3.57 from a year ago and 39.9% over the $2.96 recorded in 2019, a significant gain. I said it before, and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering, and the third quarter results are an unmistakable confirmation of that fact.\nWell, those are the numbers. Now let's speak about the markets. Auto repair continues to remain strong. The key metrics are all favorable, spending on vehicle maintenance repair, the vehicle technician comp and technician wage is up, up and up again. It's no wonder, it's no wonder the repair industry is resilient. Repair spending is rising. The cars are more complex. They need more repairs, and it costs more. The technician count is at its highest point in 3 decades, and shop owners keep telling me they need more, many more.\nWages continue to grow, and they simply reflect the increased demand for the skills that are now necessary to complete critical repair [caps]. It's never been more evident that repairing a modern vehicle with the new technology is difficult. It's an exercise of extraordinary skill. And the salaries are rising to show it.\nAuto repair is resilient. When I meet up with the people at the shop, as I often do, our franchisees and our technician customers, you can feel their exhilaration in the now and their confidence in the future. And they're making sure they can participate in that future by being ready with the tools they need.\nVehicle repair, it's a space filled with opportunity. You can hear it in the optimism in the voices of the shop, and you can see it clearly confirmed in Snap-on's performance. But it's not just the techs, shop owners are also a big -- shop owners and managers are also big players in the rise to repair. And our repair systems and information group or RS&I is positioned to take advantage. Everybody knows that cars are scarce. New and used. But for Snap-on, that doesn't matter. Repair and collision shops are busy. It's a tune we like very much. And it's evident in the rising sales of our undercar equipment and collision businesses, both strong.\nYou have a repair shop today, you see a bright future with changing technologies, and you want to be ready. New vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever from internal combustion engines to hybrid to plug-in electric to full electric. And the range of options is growing. More driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity, and we're ready to help the repair shops keep pace with powerful products like a range of Fast-Track Intelligent Diagnostics, the ZEUS, the TRITON, the APOLLO handheld enabling repair at all levels, like our celebrated Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point Advanced Driver Assistant Calibration System and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann geoliner, all representing new technologies, and all [yielding] big databases deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is positioned to capitalize.\nNow let's talk about the critical industries where the Snap-on roles -- the Snap-on brand rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where commercial industrial C&I operates with our broadest region into international markets, and with the locations impacted the most by the challenges of the day. I mean C&I is headwind headquarters supply changes or option, rising -- rises in commodity costs, uncertain fuel supply, currency fluctuations, continuing COVID lock downs. Troubled economies and war in Ukraine, well, C&I had it all. But it rolls to the occasion. And in the quarter, the group took some lumps in Europe, but over came with strong gains in North America and in Asia, despite the difficulties. And while the military sector is still down, C&I's critical industries -- the other C&I critical industries are all showing life.\nSo I describe our C&I markets as challenged in certain geographies but demonstrating continuing gains and having strong and ongoing possibilities going forward. And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there is clear and compelling opportunity along our runways for growth, enhancing the band network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets.\nAnd in this quarter, we've seen that potential pay off nicely. At the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing possibilities on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation processes. They've never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day. Especially important is with customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products.\nAnd just this quarter, Snap-on was prominently recognized with 5 PTEN, Professional Tools and Equipment News, innovation awards. And we were also honored with 2 motor magazine top tool awards. An essential driver of our growth. is innovative product make work easier. And the awards, hard one. Our testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task becoming more essential to technicians and driving our positive results.\nNow let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group. Sales in the quarter of $356.8 million were up 1.5% or $5.4 million as reported versus 2021, including a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic uplift, operating progress across all divisions, which was offset partially by $20.8 million in unfavorable foreign currency. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $52.3 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable currency represents a decrease of $1.3 million compared to '21. The effects of volume gains were more than offset by the substantial impact of currency and by supply chain inefficiencies.\nThe OI margin was 14.7%, down from last year, but still representing the highest level since the rise of the significant supply turbulence. Compared with the pre-pandemic level, sales were up 7.7% organically, and the OI margin of 14.7% was up 30 basis points despite a 60 basis point negative impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency.\nNow we remain committed to extending in critical industries, the C&I sweet spot, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise and enabling that intent is our expanding C&I lineup of innovative products, designed specifically to make critical work easy.\nOne example is our brushless CDR9015 18 volt drill. It's newest member of our MonsterLithium family aimed at industrial manufacturing and repair professionals, enabling work with the toughest materials, 470-inch pounds of torque, enough to handle even hardened alloys, 2,000 RPMs, speed to get the job done quickly. And with heavy duty -- with the heavy-duty gearing and the enhanced cooling, this tool is rugged, durable, even in extreme use. The 9015 also offers an 18-speed clutch, a variable speed trigger, a 2-speed gearbox, all the -- all for precise control, a feature that's essential for serious drilling, for professional drilling. And the 18-volt battery with 5.5 hours ensures consistent output and extended run time in effect, less charging for a more efficient workday. Tools also fitted with a 100 lumen headline, helping technician works -- helping technicians work in dark environments just what's needed for those coal sub jobs. The CT9015 has got power, speed, precision and durability. It's a great tool and the techs know it. They've already made the new drill one of our $1 million hit products. So that's C&I: continued progress against the turbulence.\nNow on to the Tools Group. The team just keeps driving upward, leaving the pre-pandemic levels behind by a wider distance every quarter. Sales of $496.6 million were up $25.2 million or 5.3% over 2021. Organic growth of $34.1 million or 7.4%, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating margin was 20.6%, down slightly, 20 basis points, but overcoming a 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Compared with pre-virus 2019, sales were $111.4 million or 28.9%, including a $113 million or 29.5% organic gain, and this quarter's 20.6% operating margin was up 680 basis points versus 2019, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed.\nSo this group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, further enabling the franchisees, guiding them to more selling capacity, and it's all working. You can witness it in any time you meet the franchisees. One big opportunity for that is our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC, held this year at the Gaylord Texan Hotel in Dallas. The theme was breaking barriers. It's a reminder of our record franchisee performance driving ever upward over the last 9 quarters, and it's a recognition of the clear opportunity to reach even greater heights going forward, almost -- yes, almost 8,000 individuals attended.\nAnd I can tell you, they were pumped, excited by the products more than 3 football fields of our latest offerings were on display, all available for viewing, handling and ordering. And order they did setting new records that we can also offer a variety of training seminars, where franchisees were able to sharpen and expand their skills to selling the full range of our complex and broad product line. It's an important movement. We say we're working to expand the selling capacities are eventually, SFC is a big part of that effort, and Dallas was another great step forward to that end. You can bet. You can bet on it. Our entire team departed as this year's get together and Dallas indicated, energized and eager to extend the Snap-on difference, reaching new individual and collective levels of success throughout the base to come.\nThey left excited and strong. The Dallas SFC will lead to breaking barriers. The franchisees' enthusiasm for their businesses and their confidence in their future will make it so. During the SFC, the Tools Group presented the newest addition to the Snap-on ratchet lineup, our FLF80, a 3-inch drive extra-long locking flex head ratchet. This new innovation provides easy access to superior turning power. Our patented duality technology makes it stronger. And the 20-inch length, the longest in the category, provides even greater -- provides great ability to reach deeper in a crowded spaces, extending reach and increasing leverages. It's a great addition to any toolbox. And as an added bonus, the new patent-pending, self-cleaning feature vanishes dirt and grim ensuring that the flex head locks firmly in place at even -- at any angle even under high-stress applications. The F80 is a special offering: access, leverage and stability in 1 ratchet. The initial launch exceeded $1 million is to hit product and sales. And volume continues to move forward upward on a steep trajectory.\nBeyond product, we spend time working to expand the franchisee's selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, RCI-ing and the van operations. It's been effective. So capacity is clearly on the rise. And you can see it in the results. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels well behind. And as we said in the SFC, it's breaking new barriers right now, and we believe it will all continue.\nNow on to RS&I. Sales were sales of $414 million, were up $49.6 million or 13.6%, including $60.8 million or 17.2% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment and sales for the OEM dealerships, but our information and diagnostics businesses were also players in the year-over-year improvement. RCI -- our RS&I operating earnings were $95.4 million representing a $12.1 million increase versus 2021, and the operating margin was up 10 basis points from last year to 23%. Compared with 2019, sales grew $91.3 million or (inaudible), including an $86 million or 27.2% organic gain.\nOperating margin was down 280 basis points versus 2019, primarily reflecting the business mix and the acquisitions. But at 23%, it was still strong. We see significant potential in our size runways for growth, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with the coherent acquisitions and with a broad array of powerful products, and the industry experts feel the same. In fact, our TRITON-D10, Fast Track Intelligence Diagnostic units was just selected (inaudible) the top 2 award and rightly so. The TRITON type deal for shop owners and for general technicians, it provides a comprehensive system verification to identify troubles there -- troubled areas, and tools diagnostic testing to pinpoint repair actions and a powerful lab scope to confirm component level functionality, all in 1 package. The D10 advanced scoping -- the D10's advanced scoping capability helps users dig deep into the vehicle systems and evaluate performance with the comparative data, and it's Fast-Track Intelligent Diagnostics, greatly shortcut the work and streamlines the repair processes, making shops more productive, more profitable.\nUnit also offers a rugged hardware exclusively designed for -- you expect this from Snap-on. The unit also offers rugged hardware exclusively designed for shop environments -- tough shop environment, a super fast, 2-second boot-up, and a 10-inch touchscreen. It all comes together for unprecedented reliability and speed and ease of use. It's a -- I'm telling you, the technicians will tell you, it's a (inaudible) product. And with the selection of the TRITON motor magazine and with the selection of the TRITON, motor magazines, now recognized Snap-on diagnostic units in 22 of the last 23 years, 22 of the last 23 years, we believe it's more testimony that RS&I is stronger than ever in shops and dealerships.\nWell, that's the highlights for our quarter. Tools Group, strong progress. C&I recording a positive performance and an upward trajectory against the variations across industries and geographies. And RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers, staff on overall sales rising again, 10.4% and 22.8% organically versus last year and the pre-pandemic level, respectively, continuing clear and positive growth. Opco operating margins, are robust 20.3% rising again this quarter, up 90 basis points. EPS, $4.14 up versus last year and accelerated well beyond pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Al. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.1025 billion in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting the 10.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in both the Snap-on Tools Group and the Commercial Industrial Group and double-digit gains in the repair systems and information group. This growth compares to the 8.4% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter.\nFrom a geographic perspective, continued sales strength in the United States and several emerging markets more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3% declined 190 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions as well as benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing, and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales are 28% improved 280 basis points from 30.8% last year. The improvement is primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from -- before financial services of $223.5 million in the quarter compared to $201.3 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3% improved 90 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings of $66.4 million decreased $4.2 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year.\nConsolidated operating earnings of $289.9 million compared to $271.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 24.2% in 2021. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 21.6% compared to 23.7% last year. The lower rate in the quarter was primarily due to tax benefits realized from the favorable settlements of income tax audits. Net earnings of $223.9 million or $4.14 per diluted share increased $27.7 million or $0.57 per share from last year's levels, representing a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results, starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $356.8 million increased from $351.4 million last year, reflecting a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $20.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment to Asia Pacific operations and specialty tools business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Lower activity with the military was more than offset by gains in aviation, mining, power generation as well as in oil and gas.\nGross margin of 36.9% declined 130 basis points from 38.2% in the third quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to increased material and other input costs partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volumes and pricing actions and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.2% in the quarter improved 70 basis points from 22.9% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $52.3 million compared to $53.6 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7% compared to 15.3% a year ago.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $496.6 million increased 5.3% from $471.4 million in 2021, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our U.S. business, which was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in our international operations, the latter largely reflecting weakness in the United Kingdom.\nGross margin of 44.9% in the quarter declined 90 basis points from 45.8% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from increased sales volumes and the pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24.3% improved 70 basis points from 25% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $102.2 million compared to $98.2 million last year. The operating margin of 20.6% compared to 20.8% in 2021 and to 13.8% in the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $414 million compared to $364.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 17.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in activity with OEM dealerships, and in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, and a low single-digit gain sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 42.9% declined 390 basis points from 46.8% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.9% improved 400 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $95.4 million compared to $83.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23% improved 10 basis points from 22.9% reported a year ago.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation was unchanged from last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $66.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.6 million in 2021. Financial Services expenses of $20.9 million were up $4.2 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $3.7 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 0.9% and 0.8% in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.8%. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.8% in the third quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year. Total loan originations of $300.2 million in the third quarter increased to $30.9 million or 11.5% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 12.5% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8% increase in originations of contract receivables.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for the United States extended credit compared to 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.2 million represented 2.41% of outstandings at quarter end, and were down 7 basis points as compared to the same period last year.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $129.9 million in the quarter compared to $186.4 million last year. The decrease from the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $63.5 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand-based requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment.\nNet cash used by investing activities of $57.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $20 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $120.7 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of 228,000 shares of common stock for $50.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $396 million of common stock under existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $56.7 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $151.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and 2.6 as of the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $759.3 million compared to $380 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nI'll turn the call back over to Nick now for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Aldo. Well, it was quite a quarter. A staggering number of media pieces have exhaustively documented the modern-day hydro turbulence that marks this period. So we all know the challenges are many, and they're substantial. But despite the headwinds, Snap-on stayed on the mod train, and that momentum shines through in the quarter across all our groups, all of them. C&I, growing 7.9% organically, extending its position in the critical with robust gains in North America and Asia Pacific, overcoming the variations in Europe, registering an OI margin of 14.7%, the strongest since the supply chain disruptions began in earnest, demonstrating continuing progress.\nThe Tools Group. We believe the franchise network is stronger and more capable than ever. Sales up 7.4% organically. OI margins 20.6% down 20 points, but against 40 basis points of unfavorable currency and representing a rise of 680 basis points above 2019. RS&I aggressively expanding with repair shop owners and managers, growing organically 17.2% over last year and 27.2% over the pre-virus era. And the OI margin was a strong 23%, and it all ends up to ongoing and ongoing upward trend for the corporation. Activity rising 10.4% organically versus last year and up 22.8% compared with 2019. OI margin for the corporation was 20.2%, up 90 basis points from last year and 170 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. And 1 final testimony to (inaudible). The EPS was $4.14 a significant gain of 16% versus 2021 and 39.9% over 2019. It was an encouraging quarter, and we are convinced it's an extremely promising future. You see, we believe that the resilience of our markets, coauthored by critical tasks and changing technologies will drive opportunity against the in. We believe that our strength in customer connection and innovative products and in the special power of our brand, will position Snap-on to fully participate in those possibilities. We believe that the considerable capability of our experienced team can navigate to any turbulence, and we believe that these are unique advantages that will maintain our substantial momentum, breaking barrier after barrier, reaching new highs through the remainder of this year on into 2023 and well beyond.\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening in. The encouraging performance, we detailed here today, was made possible only by your individual and your efforts and your collective actions for your extraordinary success in authoring another strong Snap-on quarter, you have my congratulations. For the unique skills and capabilities you're display and overcoming the challenges of these days, you have my [aberration], and for your unwavering confidence in our future and your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Come in operator."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVP of IR, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nWe have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.

Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter. Along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results. Once again, they are encouraging.\nAnd our markets, they're robust, resilient and promising. And I'll talk about our progress. We believe we're now stronger than ever. And we'll also speak about what it all means. And we believe it means that we're better positioned for more, a lot more. Then, Aldo will go into a more detailed review of the financials.\nAll we have to do is follow the news. And you know that we live today in the midst of turmoil, inflation, varying supply, continuing unpredictable outbreaks, precipitous lockdowns and war in the Ukraine and Snap-on has shown through it all. We holding our advantages in product, in brand and in people, progressing down our runways for growth, engaging our Snap-on Value Creation, driving improvement, making the most of our resilient markets and extending our positive trajectory, piercing the turbulence.\nThe story of our second quarter is simply one of rising momentum. We've been meeting the challenges quarter after quarter, and we're simply getting even better at overcoming the difficulties. And going forward, we are confident of our capabilities to continue to advance and here are the numbers that say we should be confident.\nOur reported sales in the quarter were $1,136.6 million up versus last year by $55.2 million or 5.1%, including $32.4 million or 330 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8.4% with gains in every group.\nAnd compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, our upward drive is clear as a bell. Versus 2019, sales in the quarter rose 19.5% as reported at 18.7% organically. This is now 8 straight quarters of being above prepandemic levels. We believe we're continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion and are building momentum with emphasis increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day.\nThe Opco operating income of $246.6 million, was up $29.5 million, and the operating margin, it was 21.7%, up 160 basis points from last year and 170 basis points from 2019.\nFor Financial Services, operating income of $65.3 million compared to the $68.9 million of last year. And that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 25.5%, up 100 basis points from last year and 130 from 2019.\nAn EPS was $4.27, up 13.6% from last year and 32.6% above the comparable pre-pandemic level recorded in 2019 of $3.22. I would say that since the third quarter of 2020, and I'll say it again, we believe that Snap-on is stronger now than when we enter this great withering and the second quarter numbers say it's so.\nNow let's talk about the markets. Auto repair remains positive. Most of -- not all -- most, if not all, of our key indicators are quite favorable, spending on vehicle maintenance and -- spending on vehicle maintenance and repair, up; number of techs, up; mechanic wages, up. The techs are optimistic about their prospects and about the greater need for their skills, as new technologies, new complexity advanced across the car park. And we saw a confirmation of -- in that broadly held belief for several quarters now is the number of automotive repair technicians continue expanding upward period after period, higher now than in any of the last 3 decades.\nAnd when I speak with shop-owners and managers as I often do, it's clear that there's a need for more, many more, and at Snap-on, we love it. People repair is a strong and resilient market, a feeling that's also reinforced by our franchisees. You can see it in our numbers. You can hear it in their voices. We believe they're more prosperous than ever.\nBesides franchisees and technicians, there's vehicle repair shop owners and managers, this is RS&I's arena. Demand for new and used cars is high, but supplies are limited, it's a well-known story. The pandemic has impacted the auto supply chain, sure, but it doesn't matter. Lots of new cars or scarcity of new vehicles. The car parc is large, aging, getting more of a complex and demand for repair remains strong and heck or high water.\nAnd the shops are seeing this clearly and starting to invest to meet the current need and get ready for the future. The variety of drivetrains is expanding, internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in, plug-in electric, full electric. And every day, there's more driver assistance and more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. Shops now have a greater need for new and updated equipment and they're becoming more and more reliant on service and repair information to guide them through the galaxy of new requirements and procedures. It's all music to our ears actually.\nBecause Snap-on makes great tools and equipment, and it's clearly repair information headquarters. RS&I has taken advantage of that trend, creating new equipment offer and advanced database solutions. We now have a strong array of products in that vital area. Mitchell 1 repair information software and shop management software, SPX, SBS electronic parts catalog our Dealer FX shop management technologies, electric vehicle health check solutions and our heavy-duty and fast track intelligent diagnostic hardware. These are big databases and getting more powerful and easier to use, helping the shop to fix it right the first time and efficiently.\nThe repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and RS&I has the products to match it. Finally, let's talk about critical industries. With Snap-on -- we say Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tests, a consequence, and we do. This is C&I territory, our most international operation, and it's where we see the most continuing impact of the pandemic, and it's children like supply chain inflation and supply chain disruption and inflation, where customers have been slower to accommodate where headwinds are still persisting, and we're our monthly SKU product offerings are particularly impacted by supply chain challenges.\nI suppose everybody knows about the 2-month lockdown in Shanghai. That area is a significant C&I business center. And it's also a key transportation hub for our China factory. So the lockdown was an obstacle. And beyond that focused event, C&I is particularly challenged by its considerable geographic reach, jousting with the varying impacts and protocols and economic turbulence from country -- with the varying virus impacts in protocols and the economic turbulence from country to country.\nBut I would say, if you look at the quarter, the C&I team rose to the occasion, and in the quarter, we won gains in North America, in Europe and in Asia, despite the difficulties. So I describe our C&I markets as representing continuing opportunity. And coupled with automotive repair, we believe our overall markets are robust right now, and there's considerably more opportunity ahead as we move along our runways growth.\nAnd I can't lead to a section about robust progress and abundant possibilities without once again, speaking of our -- of the engine of our advanced Snap-on Value Creation, particularly in customer connection and innovation. Developing new products and solutions borne of the observation gathered right in the workplace insights that create great new offerings and at the same time, helped guide the expansion of our franchisees' selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and more powerful communication, all of that helped drive our progress, overcoming the difficulties, accommodating the virus, taking full advantage of the market opportunities, charting a continuing positive trend moving forward, and we're going to keep it going. Well, that's the overview now.\nLet's move to the segments. In the C&I group, sales in the quarter were up 2.5% as reported or $8.6 million versus 2021, and that includes $25.3 million or -- that includes $25.3 million or 7.6% organic gain driven by progress across all our divisions. From an earnings perspective, C&I income was 51.7%, a decrease of $3.8 million compared to 2021. $2 million of that was unfavorable foreign currency and the rest represents the impact of supply chain turbulence on the multi-SKU C&I products.\nThe OI margin was 14.4%, down 140 basis points from 2021, but did represent progress in that it's a 100-point sequential improvement from the last quarter when compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 periods, sales were up 7.4% organically, and the OI margin of 14.4% was down 20 basis points, but that included an 80-point impact from acquisitions and unfavorable currency.\nNow continuing bright spot in C&I this quarter, and again, this quarter was SNA Europe, it did deliver yet another quarter of growth, expanding double digits year-over-year and well beyond prepandemic levels, all against the wind in Europe. With innovative solutions -- with the innovative solutions of our Bahco Ergo Tool Management system leading the way, tailoring products specific to customer needs.\nEurope is a varied market and SNA Europe was making increasing gains by matching the products to the specific tests. And that positive SNA Europe was joined in C&I by valuable contribution from recovering areas in critical industries like aerospace and general industry and from countries in Asia Pacific, like India, Japan and South Korea, all combined to overcome the decline in slower to recover sectors like the military and natural resources.\nWe do remain confident in and committed to extending in critical industries, and that commitment is confirmed with great new products. Speaking of product, last quarter to help solve crucial tasks across both critical industries and automotive repair. We strengthened our 14.4-volt MicroLithium power tool lineup with the new Snap-on PT851 series impact wrench. It's very attractive. It's very attractive, but it's also quite functional featuring a compact design to reach tight space, it's a nylon-based housing for rugged durability and a special toggle switch trigger for precise control.\nThe new unit also includes a tri-beam headlights for broad illumination in the entire work area. Now that's a feature that makes complex multi-point jobs much easier in the low light conditions that often occur in the workshop or enrolled repair. You can manage in it. The impact wrench also delivers a robust 225-foot pounds of bolt breakaway torque, and it's controlled by a variable speed drive. So the operator can apply just the right force for each job. And a 14-volt battery with its 2.5 amp hours, ensures consistent output and an extended run time with makes for a lot more efficient work day. The CT361 began shipping early in the quarter. And it was right on target, quickly becoming a $1 million hit product, and it's sold out, what seemed like a blink of an eye, great product.\nWell, that's C&I, a promising quarter, volume up nicely, starting to overcome the turbulence, moving down its runways for growth. Now for the Tools Group. Sales of $520.6 million, up $36.5 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable currency and a 9.3% organic gain. And the operating margin, 23.9%, up 250 basis points compared with pre-virus 2019, sales grew $114.8 million, including a 28% -- 28.1% organic gain.\nAnd this quarter's 23.9% operating margin was up -- operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with those pre-virus numbers. Coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed another positive quarter for the Tools Group, with growth across all product lines. And beyond this, we see further indications of continuing strength, other data, like the franchisee health metrics, which we monitor every quarter, they remain quite favorable and on a clearly positive trend. We do believe our van network remains quite strong and it's not just the numbers. Just a few weeks ago, I spent time with a couple of dozen franchisees, representing the regions on our U.S. and Canadian National Franchisee Advisory Councils. And they were motivated and prosperous, enthusiastic about the current performance, positive about the trajectories of the other vans in the various areas that they represent and very optimistic about their prospects for even more going forward.\nThey believe in their opportunities and they are competent in their future, the Tools Group, strong quantitatively and qualitatively. And that positivity was not just internal. Once again, this quarter, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur magazine. And once again in that ranking, we rated at the top of the tools distribution category, a place we've had for some time. And this type of recognition reflects fundamental contemporary strength of our franchisee and of our overall mobile van network.\nIt is the powerhouse business. And that momentum would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products. And one of those that help drive our hand tools up again this quarter was our new Long Nose Slip Joint Pliers, it's a special tool with our patented 3-position joint precisely machined for effortless switching and control allowing the pliers to -- it allows the pliers to keep the jaws parallel, increasing the contact with the workpiece. With -- it's got a relocated joint, optimized handle shape and unique Talon Grip serrated jaws.\nWith all of that, our new players provide over 50% more pulling power. The machines are hard and teeth are sharper and strong and presents 3 different gripping geometries from heavy serration at the base to fine grooves at the tip, great variability. For multiple applications, you can apply different parts of the jaw. They manufactured it right here in our Milwaukee factory and their fashion from special cold forged alloyed steel for greater durability and strength. These pliers were launched at the beginning of the past quarter, and they've been very well received. When I talk to the franchisees at the NFAC, they said they're flying off the truck and they're right.\nThe sales have already made a hit product status just in 1 quarter. Our new offerings are, in fact, making a difference in the Tools Group. You can't miss it in the numbers, 8 straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group is moving onward and upward with eye-catching momentum. And if you look at the numbers, or spent any time with the team, you believe it's all systems go, and it is.\nNow on to RS&I. Sales were up 4.6% or $18.2 million versus last year, including $27.4 million or 7% organic -- 7% organic uplift with double-digit growth in undercar equipment with diagnostics and information advancing. And with the dealership activity flat, from an earnings perspective, RS&I operating income of $95.7 million represents a rise of $9 million or 10.4%, and the operating margin was 23%, up 120 basis points from the last year.\nCompared with 2019, sales were up 19.5% as reported, and the organic growth was $58 million or 16.8% with strong advances in undercar equipment and in diagnostics and information products. For profitability, the OI margin of 23% was down 200 basis points -- 240 basis points versus 2019, pretty much reflecting 110-point impact just from acquisitions and the effect of the margin dilutions from the higher sales of undercar equipment that we've been seeing.\nWe believe RS&I has great opportunities, and we're fortifying its way forward with new products like our Hoffman 609 Aligner, specifically designed for independent general repair shops, where alignment is -- it's not currently a primary focus, and the space is short. The new offering allows those all-purpose garage to keep the low-volume alignment business in-house with its compact footprint and portability kit, enabling easy storage when not in use and efficient deployment when alignment is actually needed.\nIt saves a lot of space, but it gets the job done. With our latest 3D system authoring OEM-approved accuracy, the 609 enables the handling of even the most complex alignment systems by those general repair shops. It generates a high return on the investment, doesn't occupy space needed for other repairs -- often needed for other repairs, and it fortifies the garage's reputation for technical capability. It's a great value for the general repair shops, and they're noticing. Our equipment business has been on a role with strong double-digit equipment growth for double-digit quarters for some time, and the Hoffman 609 Aligner is a big player in that mix, RS&I, approving its position with repair shop owners and managers, growth in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information products and an array of innovative new products and product lines to lead the way.\nWell, those are the highlights of our quarter. Tools Group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I recording a positive performance against the variation across industries and geographies and RS&I expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers. Snap-on overall sales rising markedly both versus last year at 8.4% organically and up 18.7% organically compared with pre-pandemic levels, continuing on a clear positive trajectory. Opco operating margin, a strong 21.7% rising again this quarter, up 150 basis points; EPS, $4.27 up versus last year, up versus last quarter and up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,136.6 million in the quarter, increased 5.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $32.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nThe organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in each of the company's segments and compares to an 8% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7% remained the same as last quarter but declined 150 basis points from 50.2% last year.\nHigher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions as well as from benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27%, improved 310 basis points from 30.1% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower costs associated with stock-based expenses. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $246.6 million in the quarter compared to $217.1 million in 2021.\nAs a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.7% improved 160 basis points from last year and was up 140 basis points sequentially. The Financial services revenue of $86.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $65.3 million, decreased $3.6 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year.\nConsolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million compared to $286 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.5%, improved 100 basis points from 24.5% in 2021. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.8% compared to 23.3% last year.\nNet earnings of $231.5 million or $4.27 per diluted share, increased $23.5 million or $0.51 per share from last year's levels, representing a 13.6% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $359.1 million increased from $350.5 million last year, reflecting a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $16.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nThe organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment European-based hand tools business and Asia Pacific operations as well as a mid-single-digit increase in sales to customers in Critical Industries. Within Critical Industries, solid gains in general industry and international aviation more than offset lower sales to the military.\nGross margin of 37.3%, although improving sequentially, declined 220 basis points from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs being partially offset by the benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions and savings from the segment's RCI initiatives.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 23.7% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $51.7 million compared to $55.5 million last year. The operating margin of 14.4% compared to 15.8% a year ago.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $520.6 million, increased 7.5% from $484.1 million in 2021, reflecting a 9.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations.\nIn the U.S. Sales were up across all product lines and included particularly robust sales of tool storage in the quarter. Gross margin of 46% in the quarter compared to 45.5% in the first quarter of this year, but declined 80 basis points from 46.8% last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher material and other costs and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.1%, improved from 330 basis points from 25.4% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives and including the effects of lower expenses associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase program.\nOperating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $124.4 million compared to $103.5 million last year. The operating margin of 23.9%, improved 250 basis points from 21.4% a year ago.\nTurning to RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $416.8 million compared to $398.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit gain in the sale of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.\nActivity with OEM dealerships was essentially flat. Gross margin of 43.2%, declined 150 basis points from 44.7% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as from 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.2%, improved 270 basis points from 22.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from the RS&I Group of $95.7 million compared to $86.7 million last year. The operating margin of 23%, improved 120 basis points from 21.8% reported a year ago.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.4 million, including $800,000 unfavorable currency translation compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million compared to $68.9 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $21.1 million were up $3.1 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $2.4 million of increased provisions for credit losses.\nWhile provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1% and 0.8% in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn both the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance and contract receivables were 17.5% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $307.6 million in the second quarter increased $21.8 million or 7.6% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 11% increase in originations of finance receivables, partially offset by a decrease in the origination of contract receivables.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for the U.S. extended credit is the same as comparable pre-pandemic period of 2019 and reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the second quarter.\nAs it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the trailing 12-month net losses of $40.4 million represented 2.33% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.34% reported at the end of last quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $140.8 million in the quarter compared to $238.2 million last year. The decrease in the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects an $87.7 million increase in working investment.\nThe change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, including increases in receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand-based requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics and the current macro environment.\nNet cash used by investing activities of $73.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $53.5 million and capital expenditures of $21.3 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $112.2 million, including cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of 251,000 shares of common stock for $53.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs.\nAs of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $420.8 million of common stock under existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $46.8 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $89.5 million from 2021 year-end and on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns 2.7 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021.\nOur quarter end cash position of $812.9 million compared to $780 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 8.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Aldo. Well, that's our second quarter. Markets that are resilient and getting more robust by the day. These are interesting times in the endemic inflation, supply interruptions, a war and pop-up lockdowns, but Snap-on brings to this turbulence considerable advantage in product, in brand and in people. It's enabled our team to cut through the turbulence, continuing a positive direct trajectory. And you can see it in the performance.\nC&I on a growth path again with a 7.6% organic increase despite being our most impacted business. RS&I gains were the repair shop owners and managers, driven by hardware and its expanding information portfolio. Sales up 7% organically and an OI margin of 23%, up 120 basis points from last year in the Tools Group. Gangbuster results, sales up 9.3% organically versus last year and up 28.1% versus 2019, 8 straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels and an OI margin of 23.9%.\nAnd it all came together for overall Snap-on organic growth of 8.4%, an OI margin of 21.7% and an EPS of $4.27, all high watermarks despite the turbulence. It was an encouraging quarter. And we emerged from that period with rising momentum. It is a turbulent time, but Snap-on is driven by attractive markets by unique strengths and by an experienced and capable team that's achieved clear and consistent performance and period by period has become stronger and stronger in navigating the issues of the day.\nAnd we believe these inherent advantages will continue to prevail as we go forward on a clear and upward trajectory through the remainder of this year and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know they listen in.\nA corporation is an organization where people come together to create a benefit for themselves and others that they could not author individually. You've done just that again this quarter. For your success in that endeavor, you have my congratulations. For the energy and the skill you bring to our efforts, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you unfailingly demonstrate to our team, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVP of IR, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.\nNick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.\nAs usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.\nAny statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.\nFinally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding those measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. And along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging. In our market's still looking positive and our progress, we believe we're stronger than ever. We'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means that we're positioned for more, much more. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.\nThese are interesting times, filled with multiple axes of turbulence, but this isn't our first rodeo. We know it's always something. And it's our job to confront and to overcome with the resilience of our markets, the strength of our strategic and tactical advantages and the insight and energy of our consistent and capable team, and we've done just that. Here are the numbers that support that view.\nOur reported sales in the quarter of $1.0978 billion were up 7.1%, including 8.5 -- $8.5 million in acquisition-related activity of $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8% with gains in every group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, our clear upward drive shines right through versus 2019 sales in this past quarter rose 19.1% as reported and 16.9% organically. In fact, it's our seventh straight quarter being above the pre-virus levels. We believe we're continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, momentum, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day.\nAnd contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all combined to drive that progress, and progress there was.\nOpco operating income of $223.1 million increased $22.2 million from last year. The operating margin, it was 20.3%, up 70 basis points from last year and 120 basis points from 2019, as adjusted for the favorable legal settlement in that period.\nFor financial services, operating income of $70.4 million increased 7.8% and credit losses were down, continuing the positive trends despite the lingering effects of the pandemic. And that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.8%, a 90 basis improvement from last year and 120 basis points from the as adjusted 2019 result.\nFirst quarter EPS, it was $4, up 14.3% from last year's $3.50 and 32.9% above the as-adjusted $3.01 recorded in 2019. To risk repeating myself, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our first quarter results are solid testimony.\nNow let's talk about our markets. Auto repair remains quite resilient, I think we'd say. Spending on vehicle maintenance and repair is up and technicians are earning more than ever. They've been working, performing essential tasks, making a nice living. They're undaunted by the turbulence and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle part changes with new technology and all of that has led to an expansion in the ranks with the automotive repair technician count moving upward at its highest point for, I think, at least 3 decades. And as shop owners and managers will tell you, there's a need for many more. Vehicle repair strong -- is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in our franchisees' voices. You could feel it in a technician's wallet, and you can see it written across our numbers.\nAlso in an auto repair, standing right next to the techs, there are shop owners and managers, where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I applies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high, despite the limited supply. Dealership repair, maintenance and warranty is rebounding, and dealers are starting to invest again. New vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains, with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever, from internal combustion engines -- from internal combustion to hybrid to plug-in electric, to full electric, and the range of options is growing. More driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity.\nI'll tell you, it's all music to our ears. And we've been able to take advantage with our lineup of intelligent diagnostic products, including the ZEUS, the TRITON and the Apollo handheld units with our celebrated Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point advanced driver assist calibration system, and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann geoliner, all representing new technologies and Big Data deployed to make work easier right in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize.\nFinally, let's talk about critical industries where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence. This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations. And these are the customers that continue to be impacted hardest by the lingering virus, but they removed -- they are been recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend. Despite some significant headwinds like supply chain disruption, commodity cost increases, some challenged business sectors like the military and international -- international aviation or aerospace, and troubled geographies, conflict-impacted countries, and those more prone to business interruptions as a means to control the virus.\nWell, C&I had it all. Despite the variation, though, we did see growth, improvement in a number of geographies, Asia and Europe and in a range of sectors like general industry, education and natural resources. They all combined to author organic growth against the continuing turbulence. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as challenged, but improving. And looking forward, we believe they represent clear opportunity.\nViewing the overall picture, we believe there's been substantial progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product lines, wielding our strong brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock.\nTwo years ago, as we entered the virus -- you all remember this, 2 years ago when we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our market and the strength of our model and projected a V-shaped recovery, and that's how it played out. You can see it in the trends.\nNow let's turn to the segments. In the C&I Group, first quarter sales were $340.1 million, down $5.6 million due to $9.2 million of unfavorable currency, and $3.6 million or 1.1% -- and a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic growth. As we said, across C&I, results were mixed. But the period did see gains in Asia with Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, rising. And Europe was also up, with Sweden, Belgium, Poland and France leading the way. C&I's operating income was $45.7 million, down $5 million, reflecting $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, with the organic volume gains more than offset by supply chain inefficiencies.\nNow when compared with the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, sales were up 5.5%, including a 3.6% organic gain and the OI margin of 13.4% was down 100 basis points, but against 150 basis points impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency.\nC&I has simply been more affected by the difficulties, macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainty, varying COVID conditions. It makes sense. But the operation is spread over more countries and more industries. It's challenging, but we are making some headway and we're enthusiastic about the possibilities going forward. As part of that view, we remain committed to extending in critical industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture opportunities as they arise and enabling that intent is our expanding line of innovative new products, designed to match the demands of the industries that we serve and to make critical work easier.\nOne example is our family of microelectronic torque wrenches. And I've been talking about Snap-on electronic torque products for some time. But these smaller versions of our flagship offerings are gaining particular strength in the critical markets. Our latest, the connected Bluetooth model offers customers a solution when they need torque certification data in real time. The Snap-on ControlTech Micro Bluetooth wrench fills that requirement and combines it with the benefits of reduced size and lower weight, shorter than 12 inches and less than 1 pound, better accessibility and reduced operator fatigue, all while allowing users to interface with a Snap-on app or directly with customers with the customer's operating system.\nThe ControlTech Micro Bluetooth offers a wide range of torque, 5 to 240 inch pounds, an all steel body construction, progressive LEDs for an enhanced user guidance and a 72-inch 0.25 inch drive enabling efficient operation in tight areas, all with a plus or minus -- plus or minus 2% accuracy. It's a package well suited to critical sectors like aviation. And in the first quarter, our customers' orders confirmed that belief emphatically. Well, that's C&I., hard won progress against the turbulence.\nNow on to the Tools Group. Sales of $512.1 million, up $33.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable currency and a $36.8 million or 7.7% organic gain, double-digit growth in the U.S. being partially offset by challenges in the international operations. The operating margin was 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year's historically high level -- high 20.7%. And compared with the pre-virus levels, sales grew 24.8%, and this year's 22.7% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with 2019. The Tools Group is -- the Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, taking advantage of increasing vehicle complexity, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. I keep saying that, but that's what's written across our performance this quarter.\nWe do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network, represents a resilient and expanding opportunity. And we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel. The evidence is unmistakable in our franchisee metrics. Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. And based on those measurements, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger, and they say so themselves emphatically, pumped and primed for more that's what they are.\nAnd in our direct interactions at events like the past January's Kick-off, back again this year in person. It was a great affair, well attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are enabled by their increased selling capabilities, broadly and deeply confident in their prospects, in the company's prospects and eager to reach higher. That's an important factor. And there's a number of reasons for that optimism, but a big one is rooted in Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, authoring new products, clearly making work easier, borne out of observing changing work in shops on an everyday basis, just like the franchisees.\nAnd that's the reason our tool storage sales were up nicely in the quarter, driven in part by our -- they were driven in part by our exciting new line of mobile carts. Over the last several years, we've been enhancing our carts. One example is our KRSC range of mobile storage solutions, the only professional grade carts in the market, they're built in our Algona, Iowa plant. I just saw them running down -- I was just there seeing those units roll down the line. The KRSCs are designed for maximum strength and durability. They're constructed with a heavy gauge steel, to form a 1 piece, fully welded body with reinforced corners, and that's a significant and unique benefit in the mobile storage arena.\nThese sturdy carts make it easy to move even the heaviest tools from bay to bay. They come in an attractive range of colors and trims, just like their full-sized big brother boxes. And they're offered in either a sliding split top, providing usable work surface, while allowing substantial access to the top drawer or a single piece flip flop, allowing quicker and broader access to the most frequently used tools. Our new cart also has -- also features full wide drawers for maximum flexibility and offer power options for charging cordless tools. The KRSC, you can to say it in these 3 words, durability, versatility and functionality. They're great for meeting -- they're great for newer mechanics, as an affordable way to own some serious Snap-on tool storage. And at the same time, they're attractive for veterans. They're attractive for veterans, giving them the opportunity to improve productivity by expanding their mobility around the shop.\nThis quarter, as repair work and tech wages are on the rise, we received record orders, proving that when innovation meets a resilient market, demand follows. We said that vehicle repair was growing and it is. Complexity would accelerate the market upward and it has. And we're working hard to position our franchisees to take advantage. And you can see it in the Tools Group results, 7 straight above pre-pandemic gangbuster's quarters.\nNow let's speak of RS&I. First quarter sales rose 50.6% or -- $50.6 million or 14.6% with gains across the board. Organic growth was 13.3%, driven by undercar equipment and OEM dealership activity, delivering double-digit expansion. And by the diagnostics and information products, the independent shops advancing low single digits. Compared with 2019 sales -- compared with 2019, sales grew $70.3 million, 21.4%, including 56.9% -- including a $56.9 million or 17.4% organic gain; $15.2 million from acquisitions and $1.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Operating earnings of 91.6% (sic) [$91.6 million] increased, $10.2 million from 2021, and the OI margin was 23%, down 40 basis points, but primarily due to acquisitions and the rise of lower-margin undercar equipment.\nWe clearly see the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. The organic growth in the quarter was broad-based, but once again, undercar equipment expanded at double digits and progress in one of our newest product groups, collision repair helped author that positive. And we're doubling down on the potential in that arena by utilizing the same broad database with deep content as used in our ProDemand vehicle repair solutions; Big Data aimed specifically at the body shop, vehicle measurements to guide body work, repair information to aid in standard shop work, and calibrations to restore the sensor networks that support ADAS or advanced driver assistance systems. It's a combination that's increasingly essential for every collision shop. And we believe it is going to be a big seller.\nRS&I also got a nice boost from winning a number of significant essential tools and equipment programs for OEM dealerships. As we expected, we started to see new launches for both electric power and for internal combustion vehicles, and RS&I is right at the front. So we're quite positive about RS&I's expanding position with vehicle repair shop owners and managers and are very confident in the opportunities as the vehicle industry evolves. So that's the highlights of our quarter. Progress in the turbulence.\nC&I, growing despite the headwinds. The Tools Group, strong and confident. RS&I solid. Overall organic sales rising 8%. Opco operating margin, 20.3% and EPS $4, up significantly. And most importantly, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when it entered. It was an encouraging quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales $1.0978 billion in the quarter increased 7.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain and $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected double-digit growth in the Repair Systems & Information Group, and high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7% declined 140 basis points from 50.1% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the higher sales volumes, pricing actions, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.\nIn the quarter, we believe the corporation, through pricing and RCI actions, continued to navigate effectively the costs and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28.4% improved 210 basis points from 30.5% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower costs associated with stock-based expenses. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects.\nOperating earnings before financial services of $223.1 million in the quarter compared to $200.9 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3%, improved 70 basis points from last year.\nFinancial services revenue of $87.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $88.6 million last year. Operating earnings of $70.4 million increased $5.1 million from 2021 levels, primarily reflecting continued favorable portfolio performance, which resulted in lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $293.5 million compared to $266.2 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.8% improved 90 basis points from 23.9% in 2021.\nOur first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.5% last year. Net earnings of $217.4 million or $4 per diluted share, increased $24.8 million or $0.50 per share from last year's levels, representing a 14.3% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $340.1 million decreased from $345.7 million last year, reflecting a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit increase in sales in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, lower sales to the military more than offset solid gains in general industry and technical education.\nGross margin of 36.4% declined 230 basis points from 38.7% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and the segment's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from 24% in 2021, primarily reflecting savings from cost efficiencies.\nOperating earnings for the C&I segment of $45.7 million compared to $50.7 million last year. The operating margin of 13.4% compared to 14.7% a year ago.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $512.1 million increased 7.1% from $478.3 million in 2021 reflecting a 7.7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations. Sales in the United States were up over Q4 2021 as well, reflecting strong sequential performance in power tools and tool storage.\nGross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 40 basis points from last year, primarily due to higher material and other costs, which were more -- mostly offset by the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 30 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% improved 240 basis points from 25.2% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower stock-based expenses related to the company's franchisee stock plan.\nOperating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116 million compared to $98.9 million last year. The operating margin of 22.7% improved 200 basis points from 20.7% last year.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $398.2 million compared to $347.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 13.3% organic sales gain and $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales to OEM dealerships, as well as low single-digit gains in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.\nGross margin of 44.6% declined 140 basis points from 46% last year. This was primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and 50 basis points from acquisitions, as well as from 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and savings from RCI initiatives.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.6% improved 100 basis points from 22.6% last year, primarily due to the benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher volumes and lower expense businesses, and savings from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects.\nOperating earnings for the RS&I Group of $91.6 million compared to $81.4 million last year. The operating margin of 23% compared to 23.4% a year ago.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.7 million decreased $900,000 from $88.6 million last year, primarily due to a decline in the size of the average financial services portfolio during the quarter as compared to last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.4 million compared to $65.3 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $17.3 million were down $6 million from 2021 levels primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements.\nAs a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in both years, while the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively.\nTotal loan originations of $245.6 million in the first quarter decreased $16.2 million or 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 5.1% decrease in origination to finance receivables and 11.5% decrease in originations of contract receivables. In the United States, Finance receivable or extended credit originations were down low single digits.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit remained the same as both the fourth quarter of 2021 and as in the first quarter of 2021. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $39.9 (sic) [$38.9] million represented 2.34% of outstandings at quarter end, down 21 basis points as compared to the same period last year.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.9 million in the quarter compared to $319.3 million last year. The decrease from the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $106.7 million increase in working investment and higher payments for variable compensation, partially offset by increased net earnings. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year as compared to a reduction of inventory in 2021.\nIn addition to demand-based requirements, the increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Inventory turns at the end of the first quarter of 2022 are unchanged sequentially. Net cash used by investing activities of $6.6 million included $20.2 million of capital expenditures and net collections of finance receivables of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $106.3 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and repurchase of 136,000 shares of common stock for $28.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $442.2 million of common stock under existing authorizations.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $49 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $60.3 million for 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8% or the same as year-end 2021 and compared to 2.6% at the end of the first quarter in 2021.\nOur quarter end cash position of $861.1 million compared to $270 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter. At some level, we could summarize the environment by these are interesting times and the hits they just keep on coming. But despite the challenges, the quarters are pretty much playing out as we said they would. The Snap-on team is prevailing against multiple axes of turbulence. Our markets are resilient, with their essential nature shining through. Repair spending is up, tech numbers growing, wages rising, and the increasing complexity, electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, improved internal combustion power plants and ADAS, it's all driving demand. And our continuing investments in product and brand and people, all through the pandemic is paying off. Our franchisees are selling more effectively and are prospering.\nAnd we've come out of this great withering stronger than when we entered. C&I, seeing the most turbulence, borne out of the multiple geographies, a range of industries and a wide product footprint, serious challenges, but still progressed, up 1.1% organically in the quarter. The Tools Group prospering. Sales up 7.7% versus last year, rising 24.1% over 2019. OI margin, 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year. RS&I, 13.3% growth, OI margin, 23%, down 40 basis points, but more than explained by acquisitions and business mix; the credit company, profits up, losses down, and it all came together for an overall organic growth of 8%. And Opco OI margins of 20.3%, up 70 basis points year-over-year and rising 120 basis points compared with before the -- before the pandemic as adjusted.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSara M. Verbsky\n\nVP of IR, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.

Additional information regarding those measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with a view of our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've overcome and the advancements we've made, and Aldo will then, as usual, give you a more detailed review of the financials.\nThe fourth quarter was encouraging. It affirm the characteristics that make Snap-on the company we know it to be, the resilience of our markets, the power of our strategic position and the consistent and capable execution of our teams. It all added up to momentum, cutting through the challenges and the numbers testified to just that.\nOur reported sales in the quarter of $1,108.3 million were up 3.2%, including $12.2 million from acquisitions being offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Organically, our sales grew by 2.3%. Importantly, if you compare to the prepandemic levels of 2019, before the period-to-period variability of last year, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive. Versus 2019, sales in this past quarter were up 16% as reported and 13% organically, continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, increasing higher and higher over pre-COVID levels.\nThe quarter also bears the marks of the Snap-on value creation processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combining to offer significant progress. The progress, there was. Opco operating income of $232.2 million was up [$16.16 million] point from last year and the OI margin was 21%, an all-time high, up 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019, all achieved by overcoming the challenges of this day.\nFor financial services, operating income of $67.2 million was down from the $68.5 million of last year. But delinquencies in the quarter were below both 2020 and those of 2019, an ongoing testament to our unique business model and its ability to navigate through the most threatening of environments. And the combination of results from opco and financial services offered an overall consolidated operating margin of 25.1%, up from the 24.4% of last year and the 22.5% recorded in 2019.\nOur quarterly EPS was $4.10, well over the $3.82 of a year ago, which included a $0.02 charge for restructuring. And that $4.10 was up 33.1% over 2019, a considerable gain in my book. Those are the numbers.\nNow let's speak about the markets. We do believe the auto repair environment continues to be favorable. In the areas serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we do see some turbulence. New car sales around the world remain mixed, with China generally progressing, but both North America and Europe having a tough fourth quarter. Overall, we remain below the 2019 levels, and some new model releases and features were delayed by supply chain constraints, and that impacted the associated essential tool programs that we are involved in.\nOEM projects aside, however, dealership repair, maintenance and warranty are all healthy. Techs are seeing good times, and the dealers are looking to support their expansion in their shop. In effect, the OEM market is mixed but technicians are quite positive. There's a growing appetite for repair shop equipment, but essential tool programs are attenuated.\nNow in the independent repair shop, it's a horse of a different color. Confidence is uniformly sky high. Based on what we hear from our franchisees, shop owners and technicians, optimism and independent repair shop continues to be strong. And our sales in that sector may reflect that confidence. So we believe, on balance, vehicle repair is a great place to operate for our tools -- and for our Repair System & Information or RS&I Group.\nThe critical industries where our Commercial & Industrial group play or C&I plays, we are seeing areas of progress, but the lingering effects of virus have created headwinds. And the results in the quarter showed that trend with variations from country to country. A recovery in Asia and emerging markets, but Europe being quite mixed.\nThere are also differences from sector to sector. Education, natural resources and general industry showing improvement while the military spending continues to experience, what I'd say, a substantial challenges. Overall, however, I would describe our C&I markets as holding their own against the turbulence, public variation.\nWe do believe we're well positioned, and I think the numbers say this, to confront the challenges of this time, advancing a long ways for growth. We're also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation processes, they're a constant fuel for our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians; and innovation, matching that insight to technology.\nWe believe our product lineup just keeps getting stronger every day, and we keep investing to make it so. Vehicles are rising in complexity, technicians needs assistance, and so products are becoming more sophisticated to match the changing requirements and Snap-on is keeping pace. In 2021, we had more hit $1 million projects than ever before.\nWe've endeavored through the virus era to maintain our product, our brand, I've spoken of this before. And the virus era, we've endeavored to maintain our product, our brand and our people. And we believe that continuing commitment has served us well, offering positive results and creating substantial momentum for the days ahead.\nAnd that momentum is apparent in our full year results. Sales of $4,252 million, up 18.4% including an organic increase of 15.1% compared to last year and a 14% organic gain over 2019. Strong numbers. The as-reported opco OI margin for the year was 20%, a new high, up from the 17.6% of 2020, exceeding the 19.2% of prepandemic 2019. As-reported earnings per share for the year were $14.92, up 30.4%, or 28.3% as adjusted for the nonrecurring restructuring and the restructuring in 2020, and up 21.7% as adjusted from 2019. All clear signs of ongoing momentum.\nNow for the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $358.7 million for the group were down $5.7 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable currency. Versus 2019, sales grew $5.8 million, reflecting primarily acquisition volume and currency impact. The period saw a recovery in Asia with Indonesia. And in the quarter, we saw -- we did see a recovery in Asia with Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea and China rising. Europe and North America were more impacted by the environment and were down slightly in the quarter.\nLooking at the sectors, nice progress with our precision -- was achieved in our precision torque line. And that progress was -- but that progress was more than offset by lower critical industry activity attenuated in those critical industries, primarily by lower U.S. military spending and by supply chain-driven constraints and in the custom kitting area.\nC&I operating income was $50.1 million, down $6.1 million, including $1.2 million of unfavorable currency. The gains in Asia and the torque were more than offset by the reduced military activity in the industrial kitting constraints. As I mentioned, however, specialty torque -- the specialty torque operation did register continuing progress driven by innovative product development, customer connection and observational work. Great offerings like our recently released -- line of 3/4-inch drive breakover torque branches, capable of -- this wrench is capable of accurately fastening from 450- to 750-pound feet. It's designed specifically for heavy-duty applications, tough jobs such as torquing lug nuts on big trucks. The new unit combines our Norbar, our regionally acquired Norbar industrial torque technology with a robust ratchet design produced on -- Tennessee factory.\nThose original light vehicle ratcheting mechanisms of our Tennessee plant were reengineered for higher tension heavy requirements and were directly matched to our unique Norbar breakover device, which provides a clear indication that the torque target has been reached, ensuring reliable accuracy every time. The ratchet design with our patented -- head is rugged, capable of withstanding very high stresses and has an easy-to-read adjustment mechanism that reduces the possibility of error and is virtually maintenance-free. The new wrench also has a quick release feature for easy disassembly, compact storage and great portability. The Snap-on QB4R, we like to say strength, accuracy and convenience. And as you might expect, sales have been strong as the need for precision increases, torque products are becoming more prominent, and Snap-on is playing an active role in that rise. C&I, mixed results, but significant areas of progress boding well for its future.\nNow let's go on to the Tools Group. Sales of $504.8 million, up $9.9 million, including favorable currency and a $7.9 million organic rise from continued expansion in the U.S., a positive that was somewhat attenuated this quarter by a low single-digit decline in the international networks. But versus 2019, a more comparable base, the Tools Group rose 21.5% and has been up now from prepandemic levels for 6 straight quarters. And the operating margin was 21.9%, easily one of the highest ever, up 300 basis points from last year, despite the ongoing challenges of this day.\nWe have continued to invest in product, brand and people. And the Tools Group has used that focus to advantage. The expanding and considerable gains from the time before the virus makes that clear. In the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group results continue to confirm the leadership position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger, and that's evidenced in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They're on an unmistakably favorable trend. And that positivity was acknowledged by multiple publications, all this thing Snap-on as a franchise of choice.\nThis quarter, we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad, recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which in its latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listed Snap-on as the top 50 franchise for the 15th consecutive year. We're also featured at #3 among all franchises in Entrepreneurial Magazine's 2020 list of top franchises for veterans. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked #2 in Elite Franchise Magazine's top U.K. franchises. The judges in that ranking state that the durability and innovation shown in the face of unimaginable circumstances are what is decided in this year's top 10, and the panel was right on. Durability and innovation are what makes the Tools Group -- what marks the Tools Group in the storm is clear.\nNow this type of recognition is a point of pride for us, but it reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general, but it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products developed through our strong customer connections, learning and leading to multiple new problem solving innovations. And the results of our insight in experience in the changing universe of vehicle repair.\nCustomer connection gives us a great window on that changing universe and we put it to good use. Our sales of hand tools were up nicely in the quarter. And of course, new products led the way there. Our innovative 30, LS, DM, core half-inch drive impact suckets were a significant contributor. Born out of customer connection, observing the work in automotive shops, the special sockets, they range from to 17 to 22 millimeters, come with an extra deep hex, up to 3/4 inch deeper, accommodating the lug nuts with decorative -- that are becoming so common on the latest models. The new sockets provide the clearance needed to fit right over those nut covers without damage, grab the lug and enable quick removal without having to remove the caps. It saves techs significant time over a day of repair activity that made right here in our Milwaukee plant. They released just this past quarter, and initial sales have been gangbusters, I'm telling you. And making those sales have made that new socket line a hit product just in the volume in the fourth quarter. Accelerated sales.\nWell, that's the Tools Group, expanding the success in the U.S., balancing the international operations, continuing to innovate, building on our underlying advantages, stronger-than-ever performance all achieved against the wind.\nNow for RS&I. Volume for the fourth quarter was $392.5 million, up 8.7%, including acquisitions and 5.5% of organic growth with gains in sales of modern car equipment, increased volume of handheld diagnostics and the rise of information and data subscriptions being partially offset by a decrease in our business focused on vehicle OEMs and dealerships.\nRS&I operating margins of $97.2 million rose $7.2 million or 8% versus 2020. And that number in 2020 included $1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with the prepandemic levels of 2019, sales grew $57.5 million, 17.2%, including a $43.7 million or 13% organic gain. And the RS&I gross OI margin of 24.8% compared with a 24.9% and a 26% registered in 2020 and 2010, respectively, with the impact of acquisitions attenuating a generally positive balance for the operations.\nAgain, software products and subscriptions for RS&I were a significant plus. Along those lines, I'll mention one division, providing software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation, launching great new products to improve shop efficiency. (inaudible), I just added more powerful and exclusive features to its award-winning Mitchell 1 pro demand auto repair information software.\nYou see, as auto electronics have expanded, wiring diagrams have become a rising importance in vehicle diagnosis and repair. And the new Pro demand significantly advances what is already a clear lead from Mitchell 1 in diagram navigation, offering new features that provide interactive drop-downs, display connection data, allow easy movement to the next diagram on the diagnostic trail and enable a seamless recall of previous viewed circuits should a look-back be needed in the repair process.\nAnd as you might expect, the initial reactions to the new updates have been quite enthusiastic from both the shops and from the technicians. It's all music to our ears.\nWe keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering them more and more solutions for their day-to-day challenges, developed by our value creation processes or added by our strategic coherent acquisitions. And we're confident it's a winning formula.\nSo those are the highlights of the quarter, doing what we expect to do, achieve ongoing process again -- achieve ongoing progress against the storm. A continuing rise versus the prepandemic levels, up more each quarter now for several straight periods. Gains forged through our Snap-on Value Creation processes, strengthening our business and driving to a 21% opco operating margin, up 90 basis points. A new record.\nEPS $4.10, a considerable rise to new heights, overcoming all headwinds and demonstrating continued confirmation that Snap-on has emerged from the pandemic much stronger than when we entered with the momentum that we're confident will propel us to even higher highs as we move forward.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?\n\nAldo J. Pagliari\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the resilience and continued strength of our business model enabled Snap-on to close the year with another period of robust financial performance. The quarter also compared favorably with the fourth quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period, in some cases, may serve to be the more meaningful baseline.\nNet sales of $1,108.3 million in the quarter increased 3.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales gain and a $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 16% from $955.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, including a 13% organic gain, $20.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $7.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. In both comparisons, the organic gains more than offset lower sales for the military.\nConsolidated gross margin of 48.1% improved 10 basis points from 48% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volume, pricing actions, 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives offset higher material and other costs. For the quarter, the corporation continued to navigate effectively the supply chain dynamics associated with the global pandemic.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.1%, improved 80 basis points from 27.9% last year, which included 10 basis points of cost from restructuring actions. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effect.\nOperating earnings before financial services of $232.2 million compared to $216.2 million in 2020 and $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting an improvement of 7.4% and 39.5%, respectively.\nAs a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21% improved 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019. The operating company margin of 21% represents the highest quarterly level of profitability in Snap-on's modern day history.\nFinancial services revenue of $86.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $93.4 million last year, which included an extra week of interest income associated with the 53rd week 2020 fiscal calendar. Operating earnings of $67.2 million decreased $1.3 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the lower revenue, partially offset by lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $299.4 million increased 5.2% from $284.7 million last year and 28.2% from $233.6 million in 2019.\nAs a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% compared to 24.4% in 2020 and 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.3% compared to 21.8% last year, which includes a 10 basis point increase related to the restructuring actions.\nNet earnings of $223.7 million or $4.10 per diluted share increased $14.8 million or $0.28 per share from last year's levels, representing a 7.3% increase in diluted earnings per year. As compared to the fourth quarter 2019, net earnings increased $53.1 million or $1.02 per share, representing a 33.1% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNow let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $358.7 million decreased from $364.4 million last year, reflecting a $1.6 million organic sales decline and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries.\nWithin critical industries, lower sales to the military were partially offset by gains in general industry and technical education as well as by improved sales into oil and gas applications. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 1.6% from 2016 levels, reflecting $8.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $6.7 million organic sales decline.\nAs compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. Those gains were more than offset by lower activity with the military. As you may recall, the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is substantially complete.\nGross margin of 36.5% declined 130 basis points from 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from RCI initiatives. While pricing actions have been taken in this segment to help offset the increasing cost, the longer-term nature of certain customer agreements affects the timing of price realization.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.5% in the quarter compared to 22.4% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.1 million compared to $56.2 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 15.4% a year ago.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $504.8 million increased 2% from $494.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales gain and $2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a low single-digit gain in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations.\nNet sales in the period increased 22.6% from $411.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting a 21.5% organic sales gain and $3.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sales gains in the quarter were led by our hand tools category with strong performance sequentially as well as versus both the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019.\nGross margin of 43.9% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 60 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects, which offset higher material and other costs.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22% improved from 24% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales and benefits from ongoing RCI and cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $110.5 million compared to $93.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.9% improved 300 basis points from 18.9% last year.\nTurning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $392.5 million compared to $361.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.5% organic sales gain and $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $500,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in sales to OEM dealerships. Also during the quarter, the RS&I Group continue to benefit from the increasing number of monthly software subscribers for its aftermarket and dealership repair shops.\nAs compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $57.5 million from $335 million, reflecting a 13% organic sales gain, $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.1% was unchanged from last year as benefits from pricing actions and 60 basis points from acquisitions were offset by higher material and other costs.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales was 21.3% compared to 21.2% last year, primarily -- 150 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects, partially offset by the impact of higher sales and 30 basis points from lower expenses related to $1 million of restructuring costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $97.2 million compared to $90 million last year. The operating margin of 24.8% compared to 24.9% a year ago.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million decreased $6.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily as a result of an additional week of interest income occurring in the 53rd 2020 fiscal year. Financial services operating earnings of $67.2 million compared to $68.5 million in 2020.\nFinancial services expenses of $19.7 million were down $5.2 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements.\nAs a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the fourth quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% and the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5%.\nTotal loan originations of $256.3 million in the fourth quarter decreased $16.1 million or 5.9% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 3.6% decrease in originations of finance receivables and a 16.6% decrease in originations of contract receivables. Last year's extra week in the quarter contributed approximately $10 million of finance receivable originations. As a reminder, revenues in the quarter are generally dependent on the average size of the financing portfolio rather than originations in any one period.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase we experienced between the third and fourth quarters.\nAs it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $41.1 million represented 2.38% of outstandings at quarter end, down 24 basis points as compared to the same period last year.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $222.7 million in the quarter reflects 97.2% of net earnings and compared to $317.6 million the last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher cash payments for income and other taxes, an $85 million increase in working investment, partially offset by higher net earnings.\nThe change in working investment is largely driven by increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year versus a reduction of inventory in 2020. The increase in inventory primarily reflects higher demand as well as incremental buffer stocks and expanded levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment.\nNet cash used by investing activities of $23.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $9.7 million and $16.3 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $154.1 million included cash dividends of $76.1 million and a repurchase of 355,000 shares of common stock for $75.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $454.9 million of common stock under existing authorizations. The 2021 full year free cash flow generation of $872.6 million represented about 104% of net earnings.\nTurning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $41.6 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 58 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $57.3 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8x compared to 2.4x at year-end 2020. Our year-end cash position of $780 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.1% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nThat concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nI'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?\n\nNicholas T. Pinchuk\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Snap-on Incorporated\n\nThanks, Aldo. That's our fourth quarter. Positive performance, overcoming challenges as we expect to do. In these times of turbulence, we continue to rise based on the resilience of our markets, vehicle repair expanding the shop level, tax pumped and garage is optimistic, overcoming the postponement of essential OEM programs. Critical industry is mixed, but with promising areas, gains in general industry, natural resources and education and progress in emerging markets.\nDifficulties are in the air but we're able to prosper nonetheless on the power of our strategic position, controlling the customer interface with our wide product line and unique brand. And perhaps most importantly, we rose on the consistent and capable execution by our team, employing agile marketing, considered an active pricing, new and higher-value products, quick redesigns to match available materials, aggressive spot buying and as always, our ongoing RCI.\nIt's a combination that offers another positive performance and has all spelled out clearly in our numbers. Sales rising organically over prepandemic levels by 13% with the last four periods, up organically 8%, 9%, 11% and 13%, expanding the gain over 2019, demonstrating a positive second derivative in the rising sales quarter-by-quarter.\nOpco OI margins of 21%, a record high in the midst of multiple challenges, up 90 basis points from last year and up substantially more from 2019. And it all came together for an EPS of $4.10, up 7.2% from last year and 33% from the prepandemic period, leading to a full year EPS of $14.92, new heights despite the storm.\nIt was an encouraging quarter and the year. The period clearly had challenges, but we were able to overcome maintaining our progress, extending our upward trend. And we believe that Snap-on exits 2021 with a substantial momentum that will carry us forward.\nAnd as we mine the abundant opportunities of our resilient markets, we held the advantages of our unique strategic position and engage the considerable capabilities of our challenged-tested team. We'll continue to track progress throughout 2022 and well beyond.\nNow before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many of them are listening to this call. My friends, you are the base of the success we've registered this quarter and this year. For the extraordinary progress you achieved, you have my congratulations. For the unique individual and collective capabilities you brought to bear against the challenges, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you bring to our now and the conviction you hold in our future, you have my thanks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

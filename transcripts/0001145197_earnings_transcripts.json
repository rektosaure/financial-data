[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Ashley McEvoy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Flavia Pease, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Benjamin, Chief Operating Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Insulet's third quarter results along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that certain statements, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. The anticipated impact of our strategic actions, the potential impact of various regulatory and operational matters and the macroeconomic environment on our results of operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nAnd of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Insulet's ongoing business performance, including adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted tax rate and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effects of foreign exchange.\nA reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and available in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nDuring the Q&A session this morning, Ashley, Flavia, Eric and myself will be available to address questions.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Ashley. Ashley?\n\nAshley A. McEvoy\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Medical Devices, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Clare, and welcome. Many of you already know Clare and we're excited to have such a respected and proven professional in her role. I'd like to welcome Flavia, who is joining us for her first call as Insulet's Chief Financial Officer. Flavia is a highly accomplished financial executive with world-class health care and med tech expertise, and we're thrilled to have her with us on the team. Her extensive leadership experience in complex global organizations combined with her proven ability to drive financial performance and create long-term value, make her the ideal CFO to help guide Insulet's next phase of patient-centric growth. Flavia's thoughtful contributions and active engagement as a member of our Board were instrumental to our strong performance and are now enabling a seamless transition.\nAnd finally, I'd like to congratulate Eric on his well-deserved promotion to Chief Operating Officer. With more than a decade of experience at Insulet, Eric truly embodies our mission. His relentless drive to innovate and to find a better way has been a cornerstone of our success, and we're excited for the leadership he'll bring in this expanded role.\nI also want to introduce Manoj Raghunandanan as our Chief Growth Officer. Manoj brings 20 years of consumer health leadership to a newly created role overseeing market development, demand generation, commercial capabilities and our global brand and customer experience. These leadership changes further strengthen our team, bringing proven industry and functional expertise that aligns with Insulet's unique and advantaged position at the nexus of consumer health, health care and med tech.\nOur vision is a world where diabetes places less burden on daily life until there is a cure. Driven by empathy powered by Ingenuity and validated by science, our mission is to transform life with diabetes for people everywhere.\nNow turning to our results. This was another standout quarter for Insulet, showcasing the durability of our recurring revenue model, which resulted in robust growth and improved profitability. We surpassed $700 million in quarterly revenue for the first time with 28% year-over-year growth at constant currency rates. This performance reflects continued strong retention and a record number of new Podders across the U.S. and globally, including continued acceleration in Type 2. Operating margins expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%, as we generated operating leverage while continuing to strategically invest in our innovation road map and field expansion.\nI want to thank the Insulet team for their hard work this quarter and their tireless commitment to delivering for Podders worldwide. We continue to drive progress against our strategic objectives. In the U.S. Type 1 market, we are extending our lead with sequential and year-over-year growth in new customer starts, fueled by ongoing prescriber expansion and the highest number of competitive conversions since late 2023.\nOur growing prescriber base of more than 27,000 health care professionals underscore the strong return on our investments in expanding our sales force, improving our commercial execution and increasing health care professional education and outreach.\nIn U.S. Type 2, we are seeing strong momentum. New customer starts more than doubled year-over-year and grew sequentially. As we saw with Type 1, the power of real-world outcomes to turn skeptical providers and patients into believers is unmatched. In addition to the tremendous NCS growth, there was a large sequential uptake in Type 2 prescribers this quarter.\nEncouragingly, this was driven both by increased adoption among our existing Type 1 prescriber base and by our DTC efforts to activate new customers and increase the number of new prescribers. I want to highlight that our strong Type 1 foundation, the familiar prescriber base, our pharmacy access and Part D coverage, along with our brand and community give us a substantial head start in developing the Type 2 market.\nOur conviction and our ability to unlock the Type 2 opportunity at scale is growing rapidly. Our international business continues to deliver robust growth, reflecting increasing global demand and successful execution. We're seeing consistent momentum across key geographies as we expand access, deepen customer engagement and scale our operations worldwide.\nRevenue grew 40% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by the continued rollout of Omnipod 5. In established markets like the U.K., France and Germany, we're seeing robust growth supported by our launches of the latest sensor integration as well as ongoing positive price/mix realization from DASH to Omnipod 5 conversions.\nIn Germany, for example, our G7 launch has fueled rapid uptake among new and existing customers. We're also benefiting from growing contributions from markets like Canada and Australia, where Omnipod 5 launched earlier this year and is taking share.\nEliza and her mom Melissa, who I met while visiting our team in Toronto are among the first Canadians to benefit from Omnipod 5. Just 3 years old, Eliza struggled with overnight glucose control and Melissa rarely sleep through the night. Since starting on Omnipod 5 in April, Eliza has seen her A1C drop from 8.6% to 6.8% at her time in range double. And Melissa and her husband are finally getting a full night sleep. Eliza now loves to dance, swim and it's fast becoming one of the faces of Omnipod in Canada as local demand growth. With more Omnipod 5 rollouts planned in 2026, our opportunities to grow in our existing international markets and help more people like Eliza and Melissa remains significant.\nLast quarter, I laid out a focused set of investment priorities that will enable us to move faster, deepen our competitive advantage, drive penetration, unlock new opportunities and scale profitably. We will talk in great detail about these long-term priorities in 2 weeks at Investor Day.\nFor now, let me share some of the progress we've made during the quarter. First, innovation. Our focus on accelerating the pace of innovation and being ready to launch alongside our partners is reflected in our integration work with Dexcom's 15-day sensor when Dexcom launches so we'll wait. Libre 3 integration in the U.S. is on track for the first half of 2026 and is a top priority. Our experience across our markets shows that bringing new sensors online drive growth. We also continue to promote adoption of phone control. More than 55% of U.S. Omnipod users now control their system via smartphone, up from 45% last quarter. That shift toward app-based control improved convenience, retention, satisfaction and outcomes.\nLooking further ahead, we've completed recruitment for our STRIVE pivotal trial for next-generation hybrid closed loop and for our Evolution 2 feasibility study for fully closed loop in Type 2. I'm excited to share more about these next-generation products and their market-changing potential at Investor Day.\nNext is market development. We are pressing the advantages of our unique pay-as-you-go pharmacy access. Omnipod is already easy to access and affordable. Our system is available in more than 47,000 U.S. pharmacies and covered by over 90% of commercial plans allowing us to reach more than 300 million lives.\nMost users can start on Omnipod for about $1 a day without upfront costs or lock in commitments. Our focus now is addressing the remaining barriers to access with targeted programs aimed at easing the prior authorization submission process, and we're continuing to expand access for underserved populations more than 2/3 of our government insured customers pay less than $10 a month and over 60% pay zero.\nThird is demand generation. This quarter, we invested meaningfully in DTC investments, and they are yielding record levels of qualified leads. The majority of our DTC leads approximately 65% in the quarter come from patients treated by providers who are not currently called on by our sales force. These patients are actively requesting Omnipod 5, driving awareness and adoption with their providers. Upon seeing patient success, these providers continue to recommend Omnipod 5 creating a powerful flywheel effect that amplifies the return on our DTC investments far beyond the initial demand generated.\nFinally, its global operational scale. Our manufacturing facilities in [ Acton ] and Malaysia are ramping ahead of plan, delivering strong customer service and improved margins. We're accelerating investments to further increase capacity at these facilities to support our strong growth trajectory. And we continue to integrate AI and cloud-based tools to streamline and scale our service operations efficiently.\nIn closing, our momentum and our strategic progress gives us confidence in our outlook and make us excited about the path ahead. Our growth is broad-based and durable. Our business model is scaling profitably. Our opportunities are vast and our team is energized and stronger than ever. We're eager to share deeper insights into our growth strategy innovation road map and long-term vision in a couple of weeks at Investor Day.\nI'll now turn the call over to Flavia to discuss our third quarter results and guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start that it is an honor and a privilege to join Insulet at such an exciting time in the company's journey. Our commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes is deeply inspiring and I look forward to partnering with Ashley and the entire Insulet team to build on our strong foundation and continue to deliver industry-leading financial performance.\nWith that, I'll turn to our third quarter performance and the outlook ahead. The Insulet team delivered a strong third quarter, marked by total revenues of over $700 million, an increase of 28% at constant currency rates and 30% at reported rates. Foreign currency contributed 170 basis points to third quarter reported growth.\nNotably, during the quarter, total Omnipod grew 29% as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, new customer starts grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. In our U.S. Type 1, U.S. Type 2 and International Type 1 market, and we achieved a record number of total new customer starts in the U.S. and internationally.\nSimilar to previous quarters, over 85% of our U.S. new customer starts came from MDI, while competitive switches also contributed to growth. Additionally, more than 35% of our U.S. new starts were from Type 2. Our estimated global utilization and annualized global retention rate remains stable. Overall, our team continues to deliver robust top line growth and improved profitability, resulting in increased earnings per share and strong cash flow generation.\nI will now walk through some additional details of our performance in the quarter. First, turning to our U.S. and international revenue drivers. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 25.6% above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for Omnipod 5 across Type 1 and especially among Type 2 customers.\nAs a reminder, U.S. revenue growth this year has been impacted by rebate timing and prior year inventory stocking dynamics. Normalizing for these impacts, U.S. growth in the third quarter was approximately 30 basis points higher, representing an acceleration from normalized second quarter growth levels.\nIn our international Omnipod business, we achieved a revenue growth of 46.5% on a reported basis and 39.9% on a constant currency basis, which was also above the high end of our guidance. International revenues crossed $200 million for the first time. Our growth this quarter was fueled by robust demand for Omnipod 5 underscoring its market appeal and the benefit it delivers to patients.\nPositive price/mix realization also contributed to performance as customers shift from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We continue to see strong growth in the U.K., Germany and France, in addition to other countries where we have launched Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, foreign currency contributed 660 basis points to growth as compared to the prior year.\nContinuing down the P&L, our third quarter gross margin reached 72.2% reflecting a 290 basis point expansion year-over-year. This improvement was fueled by strong top line growth, supported by higher volumes, manufacturing productivity and favorable pricing.\nAs we all know, innovation is the lifeblood of any company. We remain relentlessly committed to advancing breakthrough solutions and strategically funding initiatives that empower us to better serve our Podders and unlock meaningful incremental value across our portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, I&D expenses increased 41%, up 80 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year. This increase in funding is focused on additional resources to support our innovation pipeline and associated clinical development.\nIn addition, stronger-than-expected growth in the quarter created an opportunity to accelerate our commercial investments with a particular focus on demand generation. These investments included our direct-to-consumer campaigns, both digitally and in mass media, to enhance brand awareness globally. This resulted in a record number of DTC leads that will help support future growth.\nIn addition, we expanded our commercial and customer experience teams as we continue to enhance penetration and extend our leadership in both Type 1 and Type 2. We look forward to further discussing many of these initiatives during our upcoming Investor Day on November 20.\nThird quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%. Our operating margin this quarter underscores the strength of our top line performance, which enables us to continue investing in our innovation road map, and strategically accelerate targeted commercial investments aimed at fueling long-term growth. As Ashley mentioned, we are well positioned to continue investing aggressively for future growth, while also delivering meaningful margin expansion. Our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted tax rate was 22.5%.\nTurning now to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $760 million in cash and the full $500 million available under our credit facility. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our financial flexibility and lower our cost of capital. We have now successfully eliminated all convertible debt from our capital structure, by extinguishing $800 million of our convertible notes due in 2026 and the cap calls associated with the notes. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 91,000 shares for $30 million. These purchases are intended to offset dilution from stock-based compensation.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. As the newly appointed CFO, one of my priorities is to evaluate and refine our guidance practices. My goal is to ensure these practices reflect the key drivers of shareholder value and provide investors with a clear understanding of our business and strategic direction. I believe guidance should reflect a balanced outlook for the business and acknowledge potential risks and uncertainties as well as potential upside opportunities.\nOur objective going forward will be focused on providing guidance that reflects a high degree of confidence in achieving while endeavoring to be more reflective of the underlying momentum in our business.\nStarting with the fourth quarter, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% to 30% and total company growth of 25% to 28%. On a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign currency. We expect fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth of 24% to 27% and international Omnipod growth of 37% to 40%. In our international business, on a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 1,000 basis points from foreign currency.\nTurning to our full year 2025 outlook. We're raising our total Omnipod revenue growth to 29% to 30% from prior guidance of 25% to 28%. We're also raising our total company revenue growth to 28% to 29% from 24% to 27%. We expect favorable impact of approximately 100 basis points from foreign currency for the year.\nFor U.S. Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth to 26% to 27% from 22% to 25%, driven by increased penetration from MDI users and competitive gains. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in U.S. new customer starts for the year. As a reminder, our U.S. growth guidance also assumes similar trends in pricing, utilization and retention as we saw in 2024. For international Omnipod, we're raising our revenue guidance to 38% to 39% from 34% to 37%.\nOn a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 500 basis points from foreign currency. Like the U.S., we expect year-over-year growth in international new customer starts for the year. While volume remains the primary driver of our international revenue growth, our guidance also reflects a benefit from positive price/mix realization as customers transition from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We're also assuming stable utilization and slightly improving retention for 2025 relative to 2024.\nTurning to 2025 gross margin. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect full year gross margin of more than 71% as compared to our prior guidance of approximately 71%. We're also narrowing our outlook for operating margin. We now expect operating margin to be between 17.3% and 17.5%, reflecting stronger top line growth and continued investments in R&D, market development and demand generation.\nThe updated outlook represents a 240 to 260 basis point improvement over the prior year period. We remain committed to enhancing profitability and will continue to deliver meaningful operating margin expansion year-over-year. At the same time, we're scaling our investments thoughtfully to support our long-term growth ambitions and ensure sustained value creation.\nLooking at a few items below our operating income. We now expect our 2025 net interest expense to be approximately $20 million higher than 2024 due to the transition from convertible debt to traditional debt, which carries higher coupon rates and the extension of our interest rate swaps.\nFor the year, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We also expect the 2025 ending balance of our diluted share count to be around $71 million, which is approximately 5% or 3.5 million shares lower than prior year due to the extinguishment of our convertible debt.\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow in 2025 compared to 2024 supported by robust growth and continued margin expansion. We anticipate a meaningful increase in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter as we invest strategically to enable long-term growth.\nAs highlighted last quarter, we are actively assessing opportunities to accelerate our manufacturing expansion plans and look forward to sharing further updates at our upcoming Investor Day. Our team remains steadfast in its commitment to driving top-tier growth, expanding margins and increasing profitability and free cash flow. These efforts are central to our long-term value creation strategy and enable us to reach and serve more people with diabetes around the world.\nFinally, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire Insulet team for the warm welcome over the past month. Your dedication to our mission and your unwavering commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes, inspire me every day. I'm excited to be part of this journey with you.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, June Lazaroff, Senior Director, Investor Relations.\n\nJune Lazaroff\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Insulet's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Ashley McEvoy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of today's call is Eric Benjamin, Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer.\nBoth the replay of this call and the press release with our quarterly results and guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. We also included supplemental information which can be found within Insulet's corporate presentation on our website. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. With respect to our performance, including adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted tax rate and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Ashley.\n\nAshley A. McEvoy\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Medical Devices, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, June, and good morning, everyone. As of yesterday, I have 100 days under my belt. I visited our top 4 markets in all 3 shifts and our active manufacturing operation. I met with physicians in the field and at the ADA. I've listened to our team, partners, health care providers, investors, analysts and most importantly, our loyal powders.\nThe welcome by Team Insulet and the diabetes community has been warm and gratifying, and I'm eager to share insights and priors with you this quarter. First and foremost, our results this quarter reflect our attractive position as a differentiated durable growth company in a large underpenetrated market. We grew 31% surpassing the $600 million mark for the first time with $649 million of revenue and continue to be highly profitable and cash flow positive.\nWe achieved this by getting a record number of people on pad. We drove both year-over-year and sequential growth in new customer starts across all of our strategic growth areas: U.S. Type 1 U.S. Type 2 and international. This reflects Omnipod 5's unique consumer appeal and strong clinical outcomes as well as solid prescriber growth and commercial execution. We delivered this growth while generating strong adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter.\nBased on these robust results, we are raising full year guidance for revenue growth and adjusted operating margin, which Anna will walk you through. For now let me turn to some observations for my first 100 days. First, I've been incredibly impressed by the passion and commitment of our Insulet team and how that energy has been channeled into the product and into the community. Everyone here cares deeply about revolutionizing diabetes management and that intense focus has earned in a unique and advantaged position at the nexus of Consumer Health, med tech and health tech.\nGoing back to Insulet's origins as a groundbreaking insulin management system for children, the company has innovated to improve clinical outcomes and transform patients' lives. Omnipod created the market for modern insulin delivery and is built an entirely new category. Patients see us as a pod, not a pump. We continue to lead the market with truly differentiated technology.\nOmnipod 5 is an engineering marvel, a complex medical device that is simple to use and delivers great outcomes for patients, it's an insulin delivery experience in a class by itself. Omnipod advantages shine through in clinical evidence. We have a large and growing body of randomized trials and real-world evidence underscoring our strong clinical outcomes across type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nAt the ADA in June, we highlighted Omnipod 5's robust results from Secure TDD, our pivotal trial in type 2 diabetes, including a 0.8% reduction in A1c and a 20% improvement in time and range. Additionally, it showed that Omnipod 5 patients use 29% less insulin and experienced minimal weight gain and lower hypoglycemia versus other therapies. All key clinical considerations for physicians evaluating type 2 diabetes treatments. Results like these are a key factor driving adoption and the tremendous growth in our prescriber base.\nToday, more than 25,000 health care providers are prescribing Omnipod 5 in the United States. This is up approximately 20% from last year and continues to grow. My conversations with powders and physicians have also reinforced that customer experience and clinical outcomes go hand-in-hand. The unique simplicity of Omnipod 5 brings people to our platform who solve themselves as too old for advanced technology or who felt a shame to be using a medical device.\nJack, a 91-year-old veteran in Baltimore discovered that a pod is easier than injections and now lives with less hypoglycemia. Samanta, a teenager from Tampa has started to go to sleep over and wear dresses again, thanks to the discretion of Omnipod and the ability to control it with her phone. We celebrate this broad impact and continue to invest in making Omnipod even better.\nOrchestrating a superior end-to-end experience for Potters has required us to divide and invest in thoughtful solutions across our business. Over the past decade, we've invested more than $1 billion in manufacturing capabilities. We have pioneered advanced automation in our plants and built a robust and secure global supply chain to deliver tens of millions of complex electromechanical devices per year at medical standards.\nInsulin's proprietary tooling equipment and processes enables a sustainable cost advantage. Similarly, for patient access, 8 years ago, Insulet began building critical payer relationships and negotiating pharmacy channel distribution in the U.S. to make Omnipod available where patients pick up their insulin. Today, our near 100% pharmacy model and unique Medicare Part D coverage make Omnipod easy to find and easy to afford.\nYou can get an Omnipod at more than 47,000 pharmacies in the United States, often for just $1 per day. Importantly, we earn our customers' business essentially every 3 days with our pay-as-you-go model. Our infrastructure is different than that of traditional pumps because Omnipod is different. Together, these advantages have given rise to a community, unlike any other I've seen during my 30 years in health care. Omnipod has grown into a beloved grassroots brand, fueled by Potter's word-of-mouth and advocacy. In the U.S., Omnipod is the most prescribed and most requested AID system. It is also #1 in new customer starts in the U.S. and the EU.\nOur more than 500,000 powders are passionate and engaged R&D partners with a deep interest in continuously enhancing our products for the benefit of everyone with diabetes. Building off of this grassroot space, we have a tremendous potential to broaden our reach, become an iconic world-class brand and grow faster with targeted and compelling marketing strategies to reach distinct segments of type 1 and type 2 patients. In sum, I'm even more confident than I was 100 days ago in Insulet's unique strength and exciting future. We have a strong brand engaged customers, differentiated technology backed by clinical outcomes and a durable recurring revenue business model, all operating in a large unpenetrated market. We have best-in-class technology, manufacturing and patient access that we have used to create a category of one. And we have a rich data ecosystem that is driving a virtuous cycle of smaller products and better outcomes. There is tremendous opportunity ahead.\nLast quarter, I emphasized that our strategic objectives are intact. That is still the case. As you can see from the results this quarter, we are executing well against these objectives. We continue to expand our lead in U.S. Type 1, driven primarily by new prescribers and new patients. The seamless expansion of our U.S. sales team has been and will continue to be a key priority as we further strengthen and scale our commercial operations.\nOur progress on this front has accelerated our momentum in the marketplace and contributed to our strong new customer starts. We are driving adoption as the first mover in U.S. Type 2. We are in the early stages of creating the market, learning rapidly and honing our approach. Type 2 new customer starts accelerated in the quarter. I'm encouraged by the strong conversion from MDI and the positive response from early adopters. Customer satisfaction is high. and we are seeing remarkable outcomes, endos with type 2 patients who have been reluctant to give themselves an insulin shots are seeing results with Omnipod 5 that near our secure T2D outcomes meaningful improvement in A1c and improved glycemic control. We are growing durably and profitably outside the United States.\nOur international business posted nearly 40% year-over-year growth and accounts for approximately 30% of our revenues. Our revenue base is concentrated in the U.K., France and Germany, where we still have room for further penetration. Omnipod 5 launches in these markets have gained strong adoption and driven positive price/mix realization. We have an immense opportunity to continue growing at attractive margins. And finally, we are investing in platform innovation as we maintain and expand our technology advantage. This includes our next-generation hybrid closed-loop algorithm in the STRIVE pivotal study and a fully closed-loop algorithm designed specifically for type 2 diabetes and our evolution 2 and simple use feasibility studies. We are also advancing our integration with the latest sensors, G6, G7 and Libre 2 have launched and Libre 3 is coming in 2026.\nIn June, we were excited to fully launch our iOS app compatible with 7. This integration represents a major milestone in our commitment to providing our customers more choices with less devices, getting Potters to use their phone versus controllers typically yields benefits to engagement, retention and outcomes. While we have seen rapid adoption of our iOS and Android apps -- we still have approximately 55% of eligible U.S. powders still predominantly using their controller. We have considerable upside as app use grows and we expand our integrations.\nLooking ahead, my focus now is determining how we build on our strengths and further scale this incredible business for even greater global impact. We are seeking to move faster, deepen our advantages, drive penetration, raise margins and open new opportunities. I'm still learning, but already see 4 areas we'll be working on. First, enhancing commercial capabilities -- we have earned a place as market leader and can now sell our clinical outcomes and experience advantages as well as our unique form factor.\nSecond, building the power of our brand globally and strengthening our direct-to-consumer capabilities to accelerate demand generation and market development. This is a key opportunity across all of our markets. Third, driving global scale, both operationally and financially. As market leaders and market shapers, we can strengthen our local market presence outside the U.S. to grow faster and expand our margins. We'll invest in market development capabilities, commercial excellence and top talent to accelerate market penetration.\nFinally, we'll accelerate the pace of innovation. We will ensure we are earlier on next-generation sensor integration, invest in technology to modernize the customer experience and improve retention and patient outcomes. We're also pushing our limits and thinking expansively about our strategic ambition and long-standing focus on solving unmet patient and clinical needs. We look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Investor Day on November 20 in active Massachusetts.\nBefore I close, I would like to thank the Insulet team for their hard work and commitment this quarter. This record performance would not be possible without your efforts. I count myself fortunate to have joined this team and this business. With our highly differentiated technology platform, we have a unique opportunity to improve lives for millions of people with diabetes to scale profitably in a large and underpenetrated market and to drive long-term value creation.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Anna to discuss second quarter results and guidance in more detail.\n\nAna Maria Chadwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Pitney Bowes Inc.\n\nThank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter, growing new customer starts on a year-over-year and sequential basis in the U.S. for both type 1 and type 2 and in international.\nConsistent with prior quarters, over 85% of our U.S. new customer starts came from MDI and over 30% were Type 2. In addition, we had the highest quarter of competitive switches since late 2023. Revenue for the total company was $649 million and grew 31% over prior year. On a reported basis, foreign currency had a favorable impact of 160 basis points. Our estimated global utilization and annualized global retention rate remains stable. Our team executed across the business delivered exceptional top line results while also expanding adjusted operating margin and increasing profit. We are proud of this accomplishment and are raising full year revenue guidance making 2025 on our tenth consecutive year of 20% or more growth on a constant currency basis.\nWe are also raising our adjusted operating margin, reflective of the operating leverage we are achieving across the business. I will walk through guidance in a few moments.\nTurning to our second quarter revenue results. U.S. revenue grew 28.7%, above the high end of our guidance range on a strong performance from our commercial team as we continue to see great demand and momentum for Omnipod 5, which is driving growth in our customer base. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth benefited by approximately 350 basis points from a prior year stocking dynamic and an approximate 150 basis point tailwind related to the timing of rebates. As we commented last quarter, this rebate dynamic was a headwind in the first quarter and expect to be neutral on a full year basis.\nTurning to international. We had another quarter of exceptional execution achieving revenue growth of 38.8%, above the high end of our guidance. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable 620 basis points over the prior year. International growth was primarily driven by continued demand for Omnipod 5 and customer base growth. As expected, Positive price/mix realization also contributed to growth as customers shift from Omnipod Dash 12.5%. We are seeing strong growth in the U.K., Germany and France in addition to the other countries where we have launched Omnipod 5. We are also continuing to work with local health authorities to expand access and broaden our sensor integration road map to drive adoption.\nMoving down to P&L. Gross margin was 69.7%. Gross margin included approximately $10 million of inventory-related charges, including the write-off of legacy components as we support the strong demand and migration to Omnipod 5, our latest technology. We are pleased to have delivered 70.7% gross margin on a year-to-date basis, and we are on track to achieve our full year guidance of approximately 71%. Operating expenses increased as we continue to invest in our pipeline of innovation and sales and marketing efforts, especially as we develop the Type 2 markets. Adjusted operating margin was 17.8% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.3% in the second quarter.\nOur team is executing well across our growth objectives and reinvestment plans, which have together generated meaningful operating leverage. Our second quarter non-GAAP adjusted tax rate was 22.1%.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and the full $500 million available under our credit facility. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our financial flexibility and lower our cost of capital. To date, we have extinguished $420 million of our convertible notes due in 2026, and we have initiated the redemption of the remaining $380 million, which will close later this month. During the quarter, we repurchased 93,000 shares for approximately $30 million under $125 million authorization and also refinance our term loan B. reducing the rate by 50 basis points, which lowers our interest expense by approximately $12 million over the remaining term of the loan.\nNow turning to guidance. We are pleased to provide our outlook for the third quarter. As a reminder, our revenue growth guidance is on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 24% to 27% and total company growth of 22% to 25%. On a reported basis, we are assuming a favorable impact of 100 basis points from foreign currency. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect third quarter growth of 21% to 24%. For international Omnipod, we expect third quarter growth of 33% to 36%. On a reported basis, we are assuming a favorable impact of 300 basis points from foreign currency.\nNow turning to our full year 2025 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our total Omnipod revenue growth guidance to a range of 25% to 28%. We are also raising our total company revenue growth guidance to a range of 24% to 27%. On a reported basis, we are assuming favorable impact of 100 basis points from foreign currency for the year. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising our revenue guidance range to 22% to 25%, and driven by customer base growth. We continue to win and lead in type 1 and gain momentum in type 2. We expect current demand trends supported by consistent rate of patient conversions from MDI to support our strong growth. We expect year-over-year growth in U.S. new customer starts in 2025.\nAs a reminder, our U.S. growth guidance for 2025 reflects similar trends in pricing, utilization and retention as we saw in 2024. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue guidance to 34% to 37%. On a reported basis, we are assuming a favorable impact of 300 basis points from foreign currency. We expect to drive strong growth in the U.K., Germany and France, while also ramping adoption in our newer international markets. All supported by benefits from new sensor integrations and customer upgrades from Omnibus DASH to Omnipod 5. We expect year-over-year growth in international new customer starts in 2025, while volume remains the primary driver of our international revenue growth, our guidance also reflects a modest uplift from positive price/mix realization. We're also assuming stable utilization trends and as previously communicated, retention trends improving slightly for 2025 relative to 2024.\nTurning to 2025 gross margin. For the full year, we are reaffirming our gross margin guidance of approximately 71%, which reflects 120 basis points of expansion over prior year and remains the highest in the diabetes technology space. Our full year gross margin guidance now assumes an impact of approximately 20 basis points from tariffs, which is lower than our prior assumption of 50 basis points, given the recent updates and changes in U.S. tariffs.\nOur strong manufacturing position and efficiencies from scale mitigate and absorb this impact. For the year, based on our strong performance to date and continued operational leverage across the business, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance to a range of 17% to 17.5%. Our guidance includes plans to continue investing in R&D, market development and demand generation. As we have communicated previously, we remain committed to driving at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion annually. As demonstrated by our updated guidance we will deliver well above this level in 2025. Looking at a few items below our operating income. Consistent with what we have communicated last quarter, we expect our 2025 net interest expense to be approximately $30 million higher than 2024, largely due to the elimination of our convertible debt, which was at a higher cost of capital and the replacement of our interest rate swaps, which expired this quarter. For the year, we still expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 25%.\nAs communicated last quarter, we expect the 2025 ending balance of our diluted share count to be around $71 million, which is approximately 5% or 3.5 million shares lower than prior year due to the extinguishment of our convertible debt. From a cash perspective, on an annual basis compared to prior year, we expect free cash flow to be higher despite higher capital expenditures as we are now evaluating the acceleration of our manufacturing expansion plans due to the increase in global customer adoption. We remain excited and confident in our objectives to drive growth, expand margins and increase profitability and free cash flow, all contributing to long-term value creation.\nBefore moving to Q&A, I want to take a moment to share a leadership update. Later this month, Claire Trackman will join Insulet as our new Vice President of Investor Relations reporting to me. Claire joins us from Baxter, where she served as Vice President of Investor Relations for the past decade. She brings significant MedTech Investor Relations experience and her addition reflects the continued strengthening of our leadership team under Ashley's direction as we look to the future. We are incredibly grateful to do later for her thoughtful interim leadership of the IR function and for her continued support to enable a seamless transition.\nJune will remain with us through the end of August. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, June Lazaroff, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJune Lazaroff\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nBoth the replay of this call and the press release discussing our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our 2025 guidance are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, including constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP effective tax rate and free cash flow. These measures align with the supplemental measures that management uses in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThank you, June. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We concluded an incredible year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving several milestones across the business as well as every one of our growth and margin objectives.\nWe continue to see robust demand and momentum for Omnipod 5, now available to both type 1 and type 2 patients in the U.S. and continue to expand rapidly in international markets. 2024 marked our ninth consecutive year of 20% or more constant currency revenue growth, and we generated over $2 billion in revenue for the first time in Insulet's history. For context, we first achieved $1 billion in full year revenue in 2021. In just 3 years, we have doubled our top line. We also delivered on our plan to grow both U.S. and international new customer starts sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This resulted in year-over-year new customer start growth for the second half of the year in both U.S. and international markets. We also grew new customer starts in both type 1 and type 2 populations in the U.S. And I am pleased to share that we have an estimated 500,000 global customers using Omnipod. And of these 365,000 are active global Omnipod 5 users. Reaching 0.5 million customers is a tremendous milestone that our entire team is proud to have achieved and elevates us to a stronger position for future growth and value creation, given our recurring revenue model which is supported by high customer retention and continuing new customer growth.\nOur ongoing achievements are proof of the overwhelming acceptance and widespread adoption of Omnipod 5 and have positioned us with strong momentum as we enter 2025 and look out over the longer-term horizon. We have great confidence in our objectives to continue growing and executing our strategic plans across our U.S. and international markets. Ana will take you through what this means in terms of our financial outlook. But first, I will highlight our initiatives and progress made across our 3 strategic focus areas. First, our work to advance the Omnipod 5 platform through our cascade of innovation fueled by data; second, our strategy to lead ongoing growth for both type 1 and type 2 in the U.S.; and third, our commitment to drive access to Omnipod 5 internationally.\nStarting with our cascade of innovation, which includes our broad compatibility with smartphones and sensors. The work to develop and establish these compatibilities from our platform has allowed us to strengthen and expand our market-leading position with Omnipod 5 and will continue to be a driver looking forward. In October, we launched the Omnipod 5 iOS app in the U.S. integrated with G6, and we have heard from many new users that iOS was 1 of the key factors in choosing Omnipod 5. Our iOS app offers enhanced capabilities that are unique and timesavers for powders, including our custom foods feature, which makes mealtime simpler. Feedback has remained extremely positive, including phrases like life changing, freedom and normalcy. Since launching iOS, over 25% of U.S. Omnipod 5 users have switched to using their iPhone. And we remain on track to launch iOS with G7 in the first half of this year. In November, we are proud to have launched Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor in the U.S. We also continue to ramp Omnipod 5 with Dexcom G7 in retail pharmacy.\nIn the fourth quarter, over 90% of U.S. customers and over 30% of our international customers were using Omnipod 5. These are significant achievements, given that we fully launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S. in mid-2022 and had only launched in 4 international markets as of the end of 2024. We are proud to have delivered terrific customer-centric innovation, which has helped us meet customers where they are and bring them on to our technology. In 2024, we saw more Omnipod 5 technology integrations on launches than in the prior 3 years combined. It is no coincidence that our revenue essentially doubled in that same period. Omnipod 5 is the most connected tubeless automated insulin delivery or AID system on the market.\nToday, I am also excited to announce our next leap forward in diabetes management with the U.S. limited market release of Omnipod Discover a new value-added service for HCPs and patients to track data, identify utilization and health trends and discuss these dynamics together. Omnipod Discover is a digital platform, connecting clinicians and their patients for personalized data management, insulin usage insights and learning materials to optimize patient engagement and outcomes. The Omnipod Discover platform will be integrated and accessible across devices from a clinician's workstation or a patient smartphone. We look forward to sharing user experience updates as we roll this out over the coming months and quarters.\nIn clinical trials, last week, our SECURE-T2D manuscript was published. These findings support our indication for Omnipod 5 use in adults with type 2 diabetes and will be leveraged to transform the lives of millions of people. Additionally, results from our RADIANT study will be shared at the advanced technology and Treatment for Diabetes Conference in Amsterdam next month. Our STRIVE study, which will test further enhancements to our world-class smart adjust algorithm will also commence enrollment next month. and our investment in fully closed loop algorithm research continues with our evolution studies with the next phase commencing later this year. These trials are further evidence of our commitment to continue to advance our technology platforms, which we validate through clinical evidence.\nTurning to our second strategic focus area, leading ongoing growth in the U.S. for type 1 and type 2. We have long offered the best technology on the market for type 1 and are incredibly excited to continue expanding into type 2. In the fourth quarter, consistent with the prior quarters, over 85% of our U.S. new customer starts were from people previously on MDI. This is a tremendous testament to the value and simplicity we bring to people living with diabetes. Since we received FDA clearance for type 2 label expansion for Omnipod 5 in August, we have been working relentlessly to build our market leadership position in the type 2 diabetes market. As a reminder, we are the first to market in AID for the type 2 indication. It's a very important opportunity for us and for millions of patients living with type 2 diabetes who need insulin. For the fourth quarter, type 2 users represented over 30% of our U.S. new customer starts as we ramped adoption in this patient population. In the U.S., our type 2 indication has significantly expanded the total addressable market for Insulet and made an Omnipod 5 commercially available to over 5.5 million people who live with insulin requiring type 2 diabetes. This market includes 2.5 million people who are insulin intensive and on MDI. We estimate that this market is less than 5% penetrated with the majority of current pump users using Omnipod. The other portion of the market includes approximately 3 million people that use insulin on a basal-only therapy every day, and that market is barely penetrated. This creates a tremendous long runway of opportunity, and we are leveraging our proven commercialization playbook to drive reach and awareness.\nTo expand our reach, we are growing our U.S. sales force to engage more patients and prescribers. As we discussed last quarter, this expansion involves adding more feet on the street and is not a wholesale change to our sales organization. We expect this expansion to increase the reach of our direct sales to over 40% of the 2.5 million type 2 insulin-intensive population in 2025 to date, we have filled over 3/4 of our expanded sales roles, and we expect the majority of those wells to be trained by the end of the first quarter. Our team is hard at work to increase the number of U.S. HCPs engaging with type 2 patients and prescribing Omnipod therapy. We saw an increase of over 20% in HCPs prescribing for type 2 sequentially in the fourth quarter.\nAs we invested in our sales and marketing efforts in the fourth quarter, we also saw an increase in new DTC leads from individuals with type 2 diabetes, and we are having great success getting those customers quickly on to Omnipod 5. We are proud and motivated by the progress we made in the fourth quarter, and we remain committed to advancing both type 1 and type 2 commercial efforts in the U.S.\nTurning to our third strategic focus area of international expansion. Our international business is also making great progress. We continue to reach more patients in the U.K. and Germany, and we're seeing strong early adoption in France and the Netherlands. This is a testament to the power of Omnipod 5, it wins everywhere it goes. We are accelerating international launches. In January, Omnipod 5 with G6 and Libre 2 Plus became commercially available in 5 new European countries: Italy, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. And we plan to launch in 5 additional countries over the course of this year. We are also on track to expand our sensor integration, starting with our rollout of G7 with first international launches planned in the U.K. and Netherlands this quarter and more markets to follow through the year, providing Omnipod 5 with more sensor options for people with diabetes. In closing, we had a terrific year, and our achievements are proof that we are continuing to build on our lead. As we advance through 2025, we will remain relentlessly focused on driving the diabetes industry forward with Omnipod 5. We have brought more patients from MDI to AID technology than all of our competitors combined over the last several years, including in 2024. Our time and investments have paid off with the number of HCPs writing scripts for Omnipod 5 growing to nearly 24,000. We have over 2 decades of experience and distinct competitive moats. Our form factor is unique and has proven very difficult to replicate. It took us years to build a patch pump product at scale with quality, high yields, safety and very well protected IP. Our form factor has allowed us to deliver widespread affordable access with pay-as-you-go economics through the pharmacy channel. The majority of our U.S. customers now have a co-pay of $30 or less a month which is essentially $1 a day or less. And given we are the only insulin pump in the diabetes space with Medicare Part D reimbursement, many of our customers paid $0 copay. And with the limited market release of Omnipod Discover, data will continue to be an emerging mode for us. Every Omnipod 5 customer is connected to the cloud, and we are able to use data to improve our algorithms to improve customer experience and optimize outcomes. Given these deep moats, which we continue to strengthen, we see ourselves as a category of one. As we celebrate 25 years of insulin, I want to acknowledge our global team from operations for getting our new Malaysia site up and running ahead of schedule to our field and customer service teams, serving and supporting our 500,000 customers our clinical team for their amazing work that supported our type 2 FDA clearance and all of Team Insulet for bringing their best self to work every day and living our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Thank you all for an incredible year. We are more excited than ever about the path ahead. With that in mind, today, we are announcing that we will host an Investor Day at our Acton, Massachusetts headquarters on June 5. We will provide further details in the upcoming weeks and months, and we hope many of you can join us.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance.\n\nAna Maria Chadwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Pitney Bowes Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to conclude a very strong year financially, clinically and operationally. Looking ahead to 2025 we are optimistic for another exciting year. For the full year of 2024, we delivered revenue of $2.1 billion, which represented growth of 22% over prior year and marked the ninth consecutive year of 20% or more constant currency revenue growth for Insulet.\nThe revenue growth was comprised of U.S. Omnipod growth of 21% and international Omnipod constant currency growth of 27%. Gross margin was an impressive 69.8% and operating margin was 14.9%. For the full year, our estimated global utilization and retention trends remained stable versus prior year. Our results demonstrate the ongoing strength of our platform and the dedication of our team, who executed our vision of getting more patients on Omnipod in every geography we serve, culminating in tremendous recent milestone of 500,000 active global customers. In our fourth quarter, we achieved 17% total revenue growth and our highest quarter of total revenue dollars. We delivered on our plan to grow both U.S. and international new customers start sequentially and over prior year, resulting in year-over-year growth in new customer starts for the second half of the year. We also grew new customer starts sequentially and year-over-year in both type 1 and type 2 markets in the U.S.\nLet me now provide more details on the fourth quarter results. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 12.4%, just above the high end of our guidance range, driven by ongoing strong demand for Omnipod 5. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2023 included 2 stocking dynamics, which total an estimated $30 million to $40 million. and impacted our fourth quarter of 2024 growth rate by approximately 1,100 basis points. U.S. revenue growth was driven primarily by increasing volume as we continue expanding our customer base. As Jim discussed, we are extending the Omnipod 5 platform through our cascade of innovations, which will support continued customer growth. Additionally, the ramp in type 2 new customer starts that we experienced after the FDA clearance in August continued throughout the fourth quarter. We expect the type 2 label expansion to contribute meaningfully to revenue in 2025. And it presents a significant long-term growth opportunity for our business given our annuity-based model.\nTurning to international markets. Our team delivered another exceptional quarter. achieving 33.1% revenue growth, which was at the high end of our guidance. Growth was driven by continued strong demand and adoption of Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 40 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 60 basis points unfavorable versus our guide. We continue to drive strong Omnipod 5 growth in the U.K. and Germany. We're also pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in Omnipod 5 adoption across France and the Netherlands, along with positive feedback from our recent Libre 2 Plus integrations. With our recent launches of Omnipod 5 in Italy and the Nordics and future market launches planned international will play an increasingly pivotal role in our growth strategy.\nTurning to drug delivery. Revenue grew 34.1% and was above our guidance range due to an increase in orders from our partner. In addition to our strong revenue growth for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to deliver exceptional gross margin expansion. Fourth quarter gross margin was 72.1%, up 120 basis points over prior year, primarily driven by U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel of Omnipod 5 pricing in international markets and improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to drive margin expansion as we scale and execute our initiatives to drive operational excellence across our global business.\nOperating expenses increased in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory, including gearing up for near-term launches globally. We once again grew R&D dollars as we continue to fund our pipeline of innovation. Operating margin was 18.3% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%. While down from prior year due to the benefits of the strong dynamics last year, we are very pleased with this strong margin results. From a tax perspective, in the fourth quarter, we released approximately $17 million of our valuation allowance, resulting in a noncash tax benefit which has been adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25% and the full year was 24%.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with over $950 million in cash and cash equivalents and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Our free cash flow for the year was $305 million, a milestone that represents our commitment to and execution on delivering a premium financial profile as we continue generating cash and investing in the business for long-term profitable growth.\nNow turning to our 2025 outlook. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 21% and total company revenue growth of 16% to 20%. As a reminder, our revenue growth guidance is on a constant currency basis. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 20%, driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption as we continue to build our recurring revenue model by growing type 1 and ramping type 2. We also expect benefits from G7, Libre 2 Plus and iOS as customers continue to move from MDI to our AID technology. We anticipate U.S. new customer starts will grow on a year-over-year basis. Our guidance for U.S. revenue assumes similar trends in pricing, utilization and retention for 2025 relative to 2024. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 22% to 26%. On a reported basis, we are assuming an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 300 basis points. We expect continued growth in the U.K. and Germany as those markets benefit from new integrations and customers continuing to upgrade from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We also expect France and the Netherlands to continue to ramp and contribute more meaningfully to our growth in 2025. And we expect the recent country launches in Italy and the Nordics to also ramp throughout the year. We anticipate international new customer starts will also grow year-over-year. Volume is expected to be the primary driver of our international revenue growth. Consistent with trends we saw in 2024, we expect international revenue to also benefit from pricing as new customers adopt our technology, existing customers upgrade from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. Our international guidance assumes a modest benefit from pricing and stable utilization and retention trends from 2025 relative to 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect a 45% to 55% decline.\nTurning to 2025 gross margin. As we previously communicated, we expect modest improvement going forward as compared to prior years, which reflected the benefit of pricing as we shifted to the pharmacy channel. For the full year, we expect gross margin of approximately 70.5%. This guidance reflects the continued build in scale and manufacturing efficiencies, including our Malaysia facility becoming slightly accretive in the back half of the year. We expect these benefits to gross margin to be partially offset by the ramp of our lower-margin international business. Additionally, our gross margin guidance assumes that our business will not be materially impacted by tariffs. We are very pleased to have a robust manufacturing position here in the U.S., complemented by manufacturing sites in China and Malaysia.\nOur supply chain strategy includes developing regionally located dual source for materials, which provides us with resiliency. This strategy has demonstrated success over prior challenging supply chain environment and offers us great optionality and adaptability in the current environment. Naturally, this is something that we are continuously monitoring. For the year, we're guiding operating margin of approximately 16.5%, which reflects 160 basis points of expansion over 2024. We expect to continue to expand margins while further investing in R&D, which we will continue to fund with more dollars on a year-over-year basis given our exciting pipeline of innovation. Our operating margin guidance also includes investments in sales and marketing, particularly as we develop the type 2 market and continue to grow our type 1 customer base. We have many catalysts for growth in 2025 and considerable opportunities to drive further margin expansion over the near and long term, coming from scaling the business efficiently even with continued investments in our robust innovation pipeline and commercial efforts. Consistent with historical patterns, we expect gross margin and operating margin to be lower in the first half of the year and improve in the second half. For 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be 20% to 25%. We expect capital expenditures to be slightly higher in 2025 compared with 2024 as we continue to expand and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as support our global expansion. Additionally, we expect to continue generating positive free cash flow annually and strengthening the cash position on our balance sheet through organic growth and profitability.\nTurning to our first quarter 2025 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 22% to 25%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%. As a reminder, the first quarter of prior year included $20 million to $25 million of unfavorable stocking dynamics. Adjusting for this, our first quarter U.S. Omnipod growth is in the mid- to high teens. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 28% to 31%. And -- on a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 400 basis points. And we expect drug delivery revenue to decline 5% to 10%. We -- in conclusion, we are very pleased with our recent progress and immensely excited for the year ahead, underpinned by our innovative technology, significant investments in growth and product differentiation. -- wide competitive moat and unparalleled feedback from providers and patients -- we are positioned to continue leading the insulin delivery field and changing the lives of people with diabetes for the better. Furthermore, we will do all of this while generating strong growth executing on our plans for gross margin and operating margin expansion and improving our profitability and free flow profile to enable come investments in key growth catalysts. To summarize, we are optimistic about the future and the long-term value we are creating. I look forward to sharing even more of these topics during our Investor Day in June.\nWith that, Operator, we will open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Hologic, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both a replay of this call and the press release discussing our second quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates.\nBefore we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2024 is shaping up to be another year of rapid growth, fueled by strong demand for Omnipod 5 and our accelerating pace of product innovation. Our financial results in Q2 demonstrate our strong execution and significant momentum across all of our markets, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we remain the clear industry leader in automated insulin delivery.\nThe Insulet team is executing at a high level and with increasing velocity, delivering strong financial performance and advancing our strategic initiatives. These first half results reinforce our confidence in an even stronger second half, and another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion as we continue to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nSecond quarter revenue exceeded our expectations across the board. In light of first half results, and continued strong momentum, we increased full year guidance for revenue, gross margin and operating margin. On today's call, I'll update you on three things: our Q2 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; execution against our 2024 objectives to expand the Omnipod 5 platform globally, and lastly, our ongoing success capturing the value of scale across our business.\nStarting with financial performance. In Q2, we achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 27% and international growth of 24%. Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology landscape. In the U.S., we maintained a strong momentum in new customer starts, achieving sequential growth in Q2, in line with our expectations. Our strategy is to drive market expansion through our focus on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. As a result of that focus, we continue to rapidly increase our customer base while remaining at the forefront of driving overall market expansion. Our growth in the quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI users in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nAt a market level, we are seeing an emerging dynamic in which customers who have adopted pump technology are switching manufacturers at a lower rate. As a result of that dynamic and our continuing market leadership in MDI, our new customer starts from competitive switches have become a smaller part of our business. However, we continue to be the net winner in competitive switching, winning more customers than we lose.\nDuring the quarter, roughly 85% of our U.S. new customer starts came from people previously using MDI, consistent with the prior quarter, and we continue to take share from our competitors.\nAcross both the type 1 and type 2 populations, we benefit from our competitive advantage in the pharmacy channel. The scale and scope we have built in this channel has significantly increased access and simplicity, which in turn helped to drive strong new customer starts and maintain very high customer retention. We're also working hard to continue to increase awareness among prescribers and this work is paying off. A growing number of health care practitioners are writing scripts for Omnipod within both the endocrinologists and primary care physician channels.\nInsulet is the clear leader in type 1 and our Omnipod platform also remains the clear choice for people with type 2. We are excited about the huge opportunity for us in type 2, subject to FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 label expansion, which we hope to receive this year. I will provide more detail in a few moments.\nOmnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. In Q2, we were pleased to again deliver international revenue and new customer starts growth ahead of our expectations. As a result of this success, we are significantly raising our international revenue outlook, this time by 600 basis points. We're rapidly approaching $0.5 billion in annual international revenue for 2024, and we're still in the early innings. The accelerated revenue we are achieving returns us to growth rates above 20% at the high end of our international outlook. We've been able to achieve these results with only 2 full country launches and 2 more just getting started, which signals to us significant runway for continued international growth as we expand access to Omnipod 5 in all of the markets we serve.\nEarlier this year, we promised that in 2024, we would deliver a cascade of innovation. And in Q2, we continued to do just that, launching multiple platform expansions. Following our successful U.S. limited market release, we entered full release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Full integration with both G6 and G7 allows us to offer even more choice for our customers and capture the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. As a reminder, Omnipod 5 with G7 is now exclusively available through several specialty pharmacies. This has allowed us to deliver an outstanding customer experience and ensure that new customers receive their Omnipod 5 G7 starter packs and Pod seamlessly.\nDemand for our G7 offering is strong. Early results are promising and in line with our expectations. We have been pleased with the performance of this channel. It is operating at scale, and we can flex to meet ongoing increases in demand. And it allows us to focus our inventory on new customers in the near term, which we continue to expect will provide us with a tailwind in new customer starts during the second half of the year.\nLast week, we provided our existing Omnipod 5 customers a free over-the-air software update enabling their controllers and compatible smartphones to pair with G7. Existing customers will be able to move to G7 once they see compatible Pods appear in their preferred retail pharmacy. Given the success of our specialty pharmacy launch, we recently made the decision to allow the inventory shift in retail outlets to progress at a more natural pace. This will allow us to minimize any potential confusion for our customers, and our channel partners, while also minimizing the risk of potential product returns and potential impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect the ease of resell pharmacy as usual, will provide an additional new customer starts tailwind as G7 Pods naturally become more widely available, now planned later in Q3.\nDuring Q2, we achieved another major milestone with the initial U.S. launch of the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G6, and our limited market release is progressing very well. We are hearing from early users just how liberating the system is. One [ Podder ] shared that \"Omnipod 5, with the iPhone is the biggest innovation since the introduction of [ A1d ] it's a delightful experience having everything on one device.\"\nWe also had a [ Podder ] tell us \"Omnipod 5, that's managing diabetes in the background .\" It is gratifying to hear this feedback and it gives us even more confidence in our ability to continue scaling our limited release and then transition to full release in the fall.\nAdding to this cascade of innovation in the U.S. we are pleased to announce that we expect to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor by the end of this year. We are excited to expand our Omnipod 5 offering to reach customers in the U.S. who have chosen the Libre family of sensors, and we are confident this portfolio expansion will generate increased demand for Omnipod 5, just as we are seeing in the early days of our launches with [ Libre Q+ ] internationally.\nTurning to international. In Q2, we extended the Omnipod 5 platform into new markets and we were the first to offer integration with Abbott's Libre 2 [ Pod sensor ] internationally, introducing this integrated offering in the U.K. and Netherlands. This also marked our first sensor of choice Pod offering, which is compatible with both [ Libre 2+ ] and G6. We are hearing from [ ACPs ] and patients that both integrations are providing an outstanding experience, including how easy it is to start Omnipod 5 using either leading sensor.\nFurther expanding global reach, we recently launched Omnipod 5 in France, which is one of our largest markets. We are in the early days and feedback from patients and [ HCPs ] has been fantastic. HCPs have noted the very positive clinical outcomes with particular emphasis on Omnipod 5's simplicity. Demand for Omnipod has always been high in France. And with Omnipod 5, we expect to continue to build on this strength and successfully drive robust adoption as we have seen in our other international launch markets.\nOmnipod 5 is now available to the majority of our European customers. And of course, we are not stopping there. We are in the final planning stages for additional launches in Italy, the Nordics, Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Belgium, with others soon to follow. For all of the countries in our near-term pipeline, you will see us begin local market work to prepare for our planned commercial launches throughout 2025. We will keep you updated on our progress, capitalizing on the enormous international opportunity we are pursuing.\nTurning to type 2 diabetes, which represents another significant opportunity for growth in our business. We are already the market leader in our space. In the second quarter, people with type 2 represented roughly 25% of our U.S. new customer starts, continuing a strong ongoing trend. The type 2 insulin delivery market is large and significantly underpenetrated. The combined patient population using either intensive insulin therapy or basal insulin, is roughly 3x the size of the type 1 population.\nThis year, we have had two important pathways for innovation in the type 2 space, both commercial and clinical. As you know, we have been commercially piloting Omnipod GO, a product aimed at the needs of basal-only insulin users. The purpose of that pilot has been to accomplish two main goals: one, determine the optimal way to expand [indiscernible] sales force; and two, develop a better understanding of the patient profile that presents in nonspecialist practices so we can better serve patient needs.\nThis pilot has led to our identifying multiple patient profiles and designing our go-to-market strategy. In parallel, we have been pursuing clinical work to expand our offerings for people with type 2 diabetes, most meaningfully with our pivotal trial with Omnipod 5 called SECURE-T2D. We recently presented the trial data at ADA, and I want to take a moment to summarize some of the key top line results.\nSECURE-T2D is the largest study ever completed for the use of automated insulin delivery in type 2 diabetes, with approximately 300 people completing the protocol. The study participants were highly diverse and representative of the general population in the U.S. This is important both from the point of view of [ HealthEquity ] and because the study results will be clinically relevant to patients as they present in the real world.\nThe clinical outcomes were striking. Omnipod 5 delivered an average A1c reduction of 0.8 with increasing benefit across the study population as baseline A1cs were higher. Those with the baseline A1c greater than 9 on average achieved an A1c reduction of 2.1. More than half of the participants were concurrently on GLP-1 therapy. And notably, results were the same across all cohorts, whether or not on a GLP-1.\nImportantly, roughly 20% of study participants were currently on basal-only insulin injections, and they also benefited in line with intensive insulin users. In this population, a key barrier to insulin adoption is the risk of hypoglycemia. And in SECURE-T2D, there was no increase in hypoglycemia.\nFinally, among several other demonstrated benefits, study participants reported a clinically valid and meaningful reduction in diabetes distress. These remarkable results clearly demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefit for people with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of these results, in June, we filed for expansion of our indications for use for Omnipod 5 with the FDA.\nNow that we have such strong results from our clinical trial work and the rich learnings from our Omnipod GO commercial pilot, these two innovation streams will come together. In anticipation of FDA clearance of our label expansion, during the coming quarters, we will make targeted investments in our sales force to extend our currently successful sales model and expand our feet on the street to further penetrate the Omnipod 5 prescribing base, and we will focus our efforts on Omnipod 5.\nWe strongly believe Omnipod 5 will provide benefit to a wide range of insulin using type 2 patients, both those using MDI and those on basal-only insane therapy. Therefore, Omnipod 5 will replace Omnipod GO as our offering for people with type 2 diabetes on basal-only insulin. We are grateful for the patients and the [ HCPs ] that participated in our pilot and we look forward to supporting them in their transition to other Omnipod therapies.\nLeading with Omnipod 5 in this space will enable us to serve more customers by leveraging and streamlining existing operations, supply chain and manufacturing, and it eliminates the need for ongoing investments in product life cycle management for a separate product platform. More importantly, we are confident we have a clear right to win in the type 2 space. We expect to be the first to market in type 2 with an AID offering, and not just any AID offering, but with Omnipod 5, which is the product platform that quickly leapfrogged into market leadership once we launched it in type 1.\nOmnipod 5 will bring all the benefits to type 2 patients that it already delivers, ease of access to the pharmacy channel, low to no upfront cost, market-leading ease of use and the unique discretion and convenience of a wearable, disposable patch pump with the day-to-day simplicity of full phone control with both Android and iOS. All of that, while delivering the striking clinical benefits we have just established with our pivotal trial.\nWe are excited to bring the best automated insulin delivery offer to the type 2 market by the end of this year, pending clearance by the FDA. Ana will have more detail on the financial impact of our refined strategy in a few moments, but the biggest financial impact will be the opening of a new addressable market for us which we fully expect will fuel our growth.\nBefore I hand over to Ana, I'd like to briefly discuss our expanded global manufacturing capabilities. We've been successfully investing in process innovation in our [ Acton ] facility, which is meaningfully contributing to gross margin expansion. And we have made significant investment in the new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Malaysia, which will enable us to scale faster and expand margins and cash flow. We are thrilled to have begun producing sellable Omnipod 5 product in Q2 in Malaysia ahead of schedule. Our new facility is over 2x the size of our U.S. facility, and we expect it to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production, ramping as volumes increase.\nOur advantages and scale position us to grow our global business profitably and seamlessly meet the growing demand for Omnipod 5, which represents an important and distinct advantage over competitors. Shortly after this call, several members of our executive team will travel to Malaysia to attend our facilities official grand opening. We look forward to celebrating this occasion with our local team as well as the many other Insulet employees globally who helped to make this happen.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance.\n\nAna Maria Chadwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Pitney Bowes Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We have significant momentum throughout our global business and delivered another strong quarter of financial results and strategic execution. Most importantly, our global team continues to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nSecond quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 23% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimated global retention remained stable.\nThe foreign currency impact on total company revenue on a reported basis was approximately 80 basis points favorable versus our reported guidance. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 27%, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 is the primary driver of our strong growth, while our integration with G7 is gaining momentum.\nWe are excited to have launched our U.S. full market release with G7 in June, and we will continue to face into our channel partners over the coming months. I will speak more to this dynamic in a few moments.\nOur year-over-year U.S. revenue growth was primarily driven by our success expanding our customer base and increasing volume throughout the pharmacy channel, including the premium [ on our Pod ]. This was partially offset by an estimated $10 million reduction of inventory in the channel as we manage the Omnipod 5 G6 to G7 transition, which was in line with our expectations.\nU.S. utilization trends were slightly lower than prior year as a result of Omnipod 5's significant ramp in the first full year of launch in 2023. As it relates to our U.S. revenue expectations, we estimate approximately half of our beat versus the high end of our guidance was due to our strong commercial execution. The other half was due to pricing benefits from channel mix as well as fewer G6 pod returns than anticipated.\nOur underlying growth is strong. We have significant momentum, and we are thrilled to have expanded our product offering and provide greater choice for our customers. With our lead position in the market and the many catalysts for us this year, we are in a great position to continue to deliver robust revenue and customer base growth in 2024 and well beyond.\nTurning to international. We achieved international Omnipod revenue growth of 24%. These results were once again well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH is doing very well internationally and remains a sizable percentage of our overall international volume, Omnipod 5's demand is very high and fueling our growth.\nLast year's launch in the U.K. and Germany are driving both revenue and new customer start growth. Although early, the increased demand we're seeing in France as a result of our recent Omnipod launch is very encouraging. Together with our rollout of Omnipod 5 with [ Libre 2+ ] in two of our markets around the start of 2Q, we are well positioned for continued growth.\nInternational utilization trends were slightly higher than in prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw last year in the U.S., but to a smaller degree. On a reported basis, foreign currency was 90 basis points headwind over the prior year and approximately 110 basis points favorable versus our guide. Drug delivery revenue was $8 million, which was above our guidance range, partially due to an increase in orders from our partner and timing of production.\nGross margin was 67.7%, up 90 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the U.S. pharmacy channel and our international markets, as well as ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting this growth was a onetime charge of $13.5 million or 280 basis points relating to components that are not expected to be utilized. This charge resulted from our strategic decision to go to market with Omnipod 5 instead of Omnipod GO to drive accelerated growth in type 2 pending FDA clearance.\nEven with this charge, our execution throughout our global business is resulting in significant margin expansion, which strengthens our confidence in our margin trajectory over the long term as we continue to execute and scale efficiently.\nWhile operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including to support the cascade of innovations we've had this year and those to come, our level of spend was lower than we expected due to a timing shift into the second half of the year. In order to drive the above-market growth we have been delivering, we will continue to invest in our business. At the same time, we are achieving margin expansion resulting from our revenue performance, gross margin improvements and the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business.\nOperating margin was 11.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 18.6% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to our revenue outperformance and the shift in timing of spend. Expansion of these metrics was partially offset by the onetime charge of $13.5 million or 280 basis points related to Omnipod GO.\nLast quarter, we provided color that due to our positive earnings trend, we may find at some point in the year that the valuation allowance we had against our deferred assets may no longer be required. In Q2, we reached this conclusion, and therefore, we released the majority of our valuation allowance, resulting in a noncash tax benefit of approximately $150 million in the period, which we adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We expect another $30 million to be recognized during the remainder of the year. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate, excluding the full $180 million to be in the range of 20% to 25%.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $820 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Last week, we successfully extended the maturity of our [ Term Loan B ] to August 2031 and repriced the loan at a lower interest rate, which will reduce cumulative interest expense over the term of the loan by approximately $17 million. Our commitment to drive profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying off, resulting in our ability to expand margins and strengthen our overall financial profile.\nNow turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 18% to 21%, representing a milestone of $2 billion in annual revenue at the high end of our range. As a result, we also are raising total company revenue growth to a range of 16% to 19%.\nFor U.S. Omnipod, we're raising the low end of our revenue guidance and now expect a range of 18% to 21% growth. We expect growth to be driven primarily by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the reoccurring revenue stream from our annuity model and growing customer base.\nAs a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of 2024 versus the prior year period resulting from the estimated orders that were accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 2024. We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half. While we continue to expect sequential growth in new customer starts in both Q3 and Q4, our guidance now contemplates a less steep ramp of new customer starts in the second half of 2024, driven by both the overall market reduction in competitive switching that Jim referred to, and the slightly longer facing period of our G7 Pods through our retail channel partners.\nWhile the latter has a temporary impact on new customer starts during the second half, it is simply timing. We are confident this strategy will maximize the customer and HCP experience, which is our top priority, while having the added benefit of limiting returns of the G6 Pod in the channel.\nOur revenue guidance continues to assume a gradual restocking in the second half of this year as we expand our distribution of G7 Pods throughout all our channel partners. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 600 basis points to a range of 18% to 21%. On a reported basis, we now assume there will be no foreign currency impact. We anticipate revenue growth to be driven by the strong momentum from last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5.\nOur 2024 outlook for international business is strengthened every day by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5. Greater-than-expected new customer starts today, as well as revenue outperformance, has resulted in raising our international Omnipod outlook by 1,100 basis points since the start of 2024. Omnipod 5 is gaining traction and taking share. Feedback has been tremendous, and we are clearly a leader with our advanced technology.\nWhile we expect our most recent Omnipod 5 launches to contribute to new customer starts in the second half of this year, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect them to contribute even more meaningfully to revenue in 2025.\nOur incredible momentum internationally strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will drive further growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. For both U.S. and International Omnipod, our guidance factors in quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in the channel for new launches and reducing levels of prior Omnipod generations. Lastly, for drug delivered, our outlook has improved and we now expect a decline in the range of 40% to 50%, reflecting our partner's revised forecast.\nTurning to 2024 gross margin. Given our strong margin performance in the first half of 2024 and the retirement of some [ risks ] we had modeled related to our product launches and new manufacturing facility, we have greater confidence in our full year 2024 outlook. As a result, we now expect to land closer to the high end of our 68% to 69% range, even with the 70 basis points annualized impact from the second quarter Omnipod GO charge. We are in a tremendous position to drive further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to executing our strategy to deliver this growth.\nWe remain committed to driving operating margin expansion as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. Even as we continue to heavily invest in commercial, clinical and R&D to fuel our strong revenue growth trajectory. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14%.\nTurning to our third quarter guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 21% to 24% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, primarily driven by strong demand for Omnipod 5, stronger customer starts and the benefit of our immunity model. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, driven by ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $4 million.\nIn conclusion, our global Insulet team continues to execute and drive strong results. We generated robust new customer starts globally and our cascade of innovation strengthens our position to deliver sustained revenue growth and margin expansion this year and beyond.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Anna Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our first quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAlso on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Coming out of the 2023 that saw Insulet emerge as the clear industry leader, we entered 2024 with significant momentum. We are off to a great start in Q1, fueled by continuing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our global Insulet team continues to execute at a high level, bolstering our confidence in another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion.\nOur first quarter revenue results exceeded our expectations for every product line. Given those results and the cascade of innovations that we plan to deliver this year, we have increased our guidance for both top line and operating margin growth. On today's call, I want to do 3 things, provide a high-level review of our Q1 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market, give an update on our broad innovation agenda for 2024 including our efforts to expand the Omnipod 5 platform and our progress in the type 2 market and discuss our ongoing efforts to capture the value of scale across our business.\nStarting with financial performance. Our first quarter revenue and margins exceeded our expectations. We achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, including U.S. growth of 23% and international growth of 15%. In the U.S., we continue to build on our clear leadership in the market and our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was #1 in new customer starts by a wide margin. Demand for Omnipod 5 remains very high and U.S. new customer starts were robust and in line with our expectations.\nOmnipod 5 is designed to expand the market through its ease of use and easy access, and we continue to succeed in driving market growth. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our new starts came from people previously using multiple daily injections, our target market, and our competitive conversions remained very strong. The Omnipod platform also remains the top choice for people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Type 2 patients represented roughly 25% of our new starts in the quarter. Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be when we first brought it to market. This is true in the U.S. and also internationally where it is dramatically accelerating our growth.\nLast year's successful launches in the U.K. and Germany continued to exceed our expectations as our teams generate strong new customer starts. In fact, in Q1, more than half of our total international new customer starts were Omnipod 5. Given Omnipod 5's early contribution in our European markets, we are raising our international revenue outlook by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. As a result, we now expect total Omnipod growth of 19% at the high end and 18% for total company, representing a milestone of $2 billion in total company revenue.\nAnna will provide more details on our increased guidance in a few moments. Our global results in Q1 make one thing very clear. Omnipod 5 is without a doubt, highly differentiated and the best offer on the market. Its ease of use, pay-as-you-go economics, affordability and widespread access make it the obvious choice for insulin delivery for people with type 1 diabetes and soon for people with type 2 diabetes once we achieve label expansion. Omnipod 5 leads the market everywhere it goes and we are not stopping there.\nDuring Q1, we made significant strides across our innovation portfolio. Because Omnipod 5 is the market leader, it's easy to forget that the current version remains our initial minimum viable product. In 2024, we will expand on the Omnipod 5 platform by bringing new sensor integrations, launching the system in new geographies and extending our cone control offering.\nIn the U.S. during Q1, we entered limited market release of our integration with Dexcom's G7 and are on track for full market release this summer, which will allow us to expand choice for customers and capture the opportunity created by the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. In Europe, we successfully entered limited market release of our integration with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor in both the U.K. and the Netherlands, ahead of our midyear launch plans.\nThis release represents 2 first. Omnipod 5 is the first AID system to offer integration with the Libre 2 sensor in Europe, which is Abbott's most widely adopted CGM, and Omnipod 5 in the Netherlands represents our first sensor of choice pod offering. These pods are compatible with both Abbott Libre 2 plus and Dexcom's G6 sensor. Early results from the U.K. and the Netherlands are extremely promising and we look forward to providing future updates with regard to the timing of full market release.\nStaying in Europe, we are pleased to announce that we now plan to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in France also this summer. France has historically been one of our largest markets and one in which we know demand for our solutions is high. When we first launched Omnipod DASH in this market, it quickly became the insulin pump brand of choice, and we are confident in our ability to drive strong adoption with our advanced AID system. With the launch in France, we will achieve our stated goal of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers and reached this milestone ahead of our internal end of year expectations.\nWe anticipate our recent Omnipod 5 international launches will fuel accelerated new customer starts in the second half of this year and revenue growth next year and beyond. We also plan to enter our U.S. limited market release for our iOS app this summer. Extending Omnipod 5 onto the iPhone platform is one of our most frequently requested features, and we are excited to bring this offer to market.\nTurning to the opportunity in type 2 diabetes, where we remain the U.S. market leader in this large and underserved patient population. The commercial pilot with Omnipod Go, our FDA-cleared offering for the over 3 million people in the U.S. who need daily basal-only insulin, continues to offer significant learnings. Because of our pilot efforts, we have developed a better understanding of this market, and we have expanded the definition of targeted patient segments. We now also have even greater confidence that we will be able to bring our innovative technology to a broader range of HCP and physician practices.\nWe are refining our plans for extended commercial reach based on those learnings. We also know that there is significant current demand for solutions that support intensive insulin use for people with type 2 diabetes. In this market, Omnipod DASH continues to perform extremely well driven by its ease of use and accessibility. In that context, we are very excited about the progress we are making towards achieving FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 for type 2.\nDuring Q1, we reached a key milestone in our SECURE-T2D pivotal trial with the last patient completing the protocol. We are well on track to meet our goal of submitting to the FDA for label expansion by the end of the year. Once cleared, we expect to meaningfully accelerate Omnipod 5 adoption among the approximate 2.5 million people with insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes. And we will have the broadest offering of insulin delivery technology solutions on the market for this important patient population.\nLastly, we continue to analyze the market impact of GLP-1 use. Analysis of actual claims data demonstrates that GLP-1 use accelerates the adoption of insulin among people living with type 2 diabetes. The data are definitive and [indiscernible] and strengthen our conviction in the size of the unmet need and the size of the business opportunity for our growing type 2 portfolio. We are finalizing our analysis and look forward to providing a more detailed update soon.\n2024 is shaping up as we planned to be a year filled with a cascade of innovations that will allow us to build on our position in market leadership, and we will take advantage of those innovations because of our expanding scale. Our business continues to enjoy several advantages that we've achieved through commercial scope and operational scale. First, our products have very broad reimbursement with more than 95% of covered lives in the U.S. for both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH. And through our nationwide distribution reach, Omnipod is available at retail pharmacies that are within 5 miles of over 85% of the U.S. population.\nOur strategy to increase awareness of Omnipod with endocrinologists and primary care physicians has resulted in an expanded base of health care providers writing scripts for our products, fueling our leadership position. In the U.S., in Q1, the number of U.S. Omnipod 5 prescribing HCPs grew to over 20,000, up from over 18,500 the prior quarter. These prescribers were endocrinologists, PCPs and other HCPs and the split was approximately 1/3 each and the prescribers span both the type 1 and type 2 markets and both increased substantially year-over-year.\nIn order to fuel our growth, we are further expanding our commercial reach. Internationally, we continue to prudently invest in our commercial expansion and in our market access capabilities. In the U.S., we are in the process of incrementally expanding our sales force, including the creation of new territories and expansion into targeted pediatric centers. Our broad sales, marketing and channel capabilities allow us to reach a large and growing population of patients and represent a growing set of advantages over aspiring competitors.\nLastly, we also enjoyed significant financial benefits from our scaled manufacturing. Insulet has been on a 20-year journey of capability building and continuous improvement, which has allowed us to build world-class capabilities to drive ongoing quality and productivity. Manufacturing scale and scope have been big drivers of our gross margin expansion over that time and we expect our new Malaysia facility will fuel continued efficiency gains.\nWe are in the final stages of validating our manufacturing lines in Malaysia and expect to begin producing salable product in Q3. The facility represents a sizable investment of approximately $200 million over the course of 4 years through 2026, provides approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and is expected to house more than 1,000 full-time employees at full capacity.\nOur regional sourcing strategy includes using local suppliers for components contributing to resiliency and improved costs. This facility will also strengthen our global operational capabilities, drive increased capacity to meet our robust demand and support future international market expansion. We expect our Malaysia site to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production ramping over time. It represents one of the many opportunities we have to lower total landed product costs and expand margins over the near and long term.\nOur advantages in scope and scale put Insulet in a strong position to continue to invest in the growth of our business and to expand our margins. This is yet another way in which our business is unique among our direct competitors. With that, I'll introduce Anna, who is joining us for her first call as our CFO, as you will have seen in our announcement, Ana is a highly accomplished and proven leader. We are thrilled to have her join the Insulet team, and I'm personally looking forward to benefiting from our partnership as we execute our strategy to drive rapid growth and strengthen our financial profile. Over to you, Ana.\n\nAna Maria Chadwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Pitney Bowes Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into the first quarter financial results, I want to say how excited I am to be part of this outstanding company. Insulet is transforming diabetes management and improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people while driving strong financial performance. I am confident that we're just getting started, especially with the exciting developments in our pipeline.\nI look forward to partnering with Jim, our skilled leadership and the rest of Insulet's talented global team to advance our mission for our customers while also delivering robust revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value. And above all else, I look forward to helping make a positive impact on people around the world with diabetes. Now on to our first quarter results. First quarter exceeded our expectations, and we generated strong global new customer starts. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 23% revenue growth, driven by global Omnipod growth of 21% and our estimated global retention and utilization trends remain stable.\nForeign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind for our total revenue on a reported basis compared to first quarter last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 23%, driven by robust growth on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes customer bases as well as expanding volume through the pharmacy channel. Adoption of Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 continues to be the driving force, and we are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release with G7, which we expect will accelerate new customer starts in the second half of this year, following our planned full market release this summer.\nOur U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5 success and robust demand. with many catalysts ahead of us this year, we're laying the foundation for sustained revenue growth for 2024 and beyond. International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, which was well above our expectations. While Omnipod Dash remains the largest percentage of our overall international volume, last year's Omnipod 5 launches in both the U.K. and Germany continue to drive notable increases in new customer starts and were the primary drivers of our accelerated growth.\nOn a reported basis, foreign currency was 210 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 110 points favorable versus our guide. Drug delivery revenue was almost $9 million, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 69.5%, up 230 basis points on a reported basis and up 460 basis points compared to prior year adjusted gross margin. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our internal expectations was primarily due to volume growth in the U.S. pharmacy channel with a premium on the pods as well as our international Omnipod revenue performance and improved manufacturing efficiencies.\nWhile operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including multiple product launches globally, the timing of some expected spend shifted into the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest to drive above-market growth while remaining committed to expanding operating margins through improvements in gross margin as well as efficiencies throughout our global business.\nOperating margin was 12.9%, and adjusted EBITDA was 20.2% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin as well as timing of spend.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $750 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. As anticipated, our increased efforts to drive profitable growth are translating into expanding margins and a stronger overall financial profile.\nNow turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we're raising expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 15% to 19% and total company revenue growth to a range of 14% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance and now expect a range of 17% to 21% revenue growth. We expect growth to be driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption, which provides the benefits of reoccurring revenue stream due to our annuity model.\nWe continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half of 2024, consistent with normal historical seasonality trends. Additionally, our planned U.S. full market release of Omnibus 5 with G7 this summer is expected to contribute to the acceleration of new customer starts in the back half of the year. We are well positioned to accelerate new customer starts this year, which we expect will drive further revenue growth next year and beyond.\nWe have massive market opportunities, not only from further Type 1 MDI penetration, but also as we continue to penetrate the type 2 market. We are building a type 2 product portfolio and are excited to have this be one of our accelerated growth drivers over the near and long term.\nFor international Omnipods, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. We expect growth to be driven by last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5.\nThe substantial rate in our international revenue outlook reflects the outperformance of new customer starts and revenue since we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany, and to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. We originally expected revenue growth in the first half of the year to be in the high single digits. With our revised outlook, we now expect first half growth of 13% to 15% and similar second half year-over-year growth profile, also up from prior expectations.\nWe expect our recent Omnipod 5 launches in 1Q to contribute to new customer starts in the second half of the year and given the nature of our annuity model to more meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth in 2025. We have strong momentum internationally, and we are confident that Omnipod 5 will drive growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. For both the U.S. and international Omnipod, we expect quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024.\nThis includes ramping inventory in channels for new launches and reducing levels for prior Omnipod generations. We do not expect this to materially impact our full year outlook. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our expectations of a 50% to 60% decline. Turning to 2024 gross margin, we are reaffirming a range of 68% to 69%, closer to the midpoint of the range.\nWhile we have a number of opportunities that could result in further gross margin expansion this year, we want to be prudent with our expectations given risks that come with significant product launches and standing up a new manufacturing facility. We are in a fantastic position to continue driving further gross margin expansion over the near and long term and we remain committed to doing so.\nWe also have an increased commitment to drive operating margin expansion. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D, clinical and our commercial launches, we now expect to drive some operating leverage as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. As a result, we are raising our operating margin expectations to approximately 13.5%, up 50 basis points from our original expectations. Although we don't guide to our effective tax rate, I will provide color since our income continues to grow.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate almost doubled to approximately 6% due to changes in income distribution among our jurisdictions. Given the positive trend in our earnings, we may reach a point this year where we conclude that the valuation allowance we have against our net deferred tax assets is no longer needed. We estimate this would result in a $200 million noncash reduction of income tax expense in the period the release is recorded, which we would adjust out for non-GAAP purposes.\nSubsequently, our effective tax rate may increase to an estimated annualized operational run rate of approximately 20% for the near term.\nTurning to our second quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 18% to 21% and total company growth of 15% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%. Growth drivers include the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, bringing with it the advantages of U.S. pharmacy channel, continued strong new customer starts and the benefits of our annuity model. With our new customer starts momentum, we expect sequential growth in second quarter, partially offset by wholesalers taking down G6 pod inventory as we begin to ramp G7 pods, and we expect to see some meaningful second half sequential dollar growth for the many catalysts we discussed.\nFor international Omnipod, we expect growth of 12% to 15%, driven by the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5 in our initial markets, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we expect an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 200 basis points. Finally, we expect Q2 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $4 million to $5 million.\nIn conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect continued successful execution of our strategy as well as robust new customer starts in both our U.S. and international markets. In my first few weeks at Insulet, I have been incredibly impressed with what the company continues to accomplish, and I am even more energized by the incredible opportunities that lie ahead, which are greater than I had envisioned before joining. We are well positioned and remain committed to delivering sustained revenue growth and margin expansion for the balance of this year and well beyond.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Budden, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2023 results, and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. .\nAlso on our website is our fourth quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted growth and operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With our strong Q4 2023 results, we kept off another transformational year, in which we firmly established Insulet as the market leader in automated insulin delivery. In 2023, we realized a 30% revenue growth, which marked our eighth consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth and represented dollar growth of almost $400 million.\nWe accomplished this while also significantly expanding margins and generating positive free cash flow. Our record new customer starts in 2023, fueled our global growth and our Omnipod 5 AID system, which generated $1 billion in revenue in 2023 is transforming diabetes management. We entered 2024 with significant momentum, and we are looking forward to a year of many growth catalysts ahead. On today's call, I want to do 3 things: first, discuss our financial results and market traction. Next, I'll provide an update on the continuing progress of our clinical efforts and then review key developments in our innovation pipeline.\nOur fourth quarter revenue once again exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 35%, including U.S. growth of 43%. Part of our outperformance was driven by U.S. distributors placing additional orders near the end of the quarter, which we had not factored into our guidance. We'll provide more detail on this in a few minutes. Yet even without these additional orders, we closed out 2023 ahead of our expectations, including healthy margin expansion. These are remarkable results, and I want to thank our global team for their execution and dedication.\nWe are proud of the incredible impact the Omnipod product platform is having on people with diabetes. We recently achieved milestones of roughly 425,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, which represents growth of approximately 25% from this time last year. This also includes almost 250,000 customers on Omnipod 5, which has proven to be revolutionary. And Omnipod DASH continues to drive strong new customer starts in our U.S. Type 2 diabetes market as well as in most of our international markets. We are thrilled that our unique technology is making a meaningful impact on the diabetes community, advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world.\nOmnipod 5 is the only FDA-cleared, fully disposable pod-based AID system. This makes our product unique and clearly differentiated from competitors' offers. These product attributes underpin our competitive advantages and are key to fueling our growth, further establishing our leadership position and expertise in the diabetes market. The fully on-body wearable AID experience of Omnipod 5 dramatically reduces the daily burden of living with diabetes. And its simplicity, ease of use and broad and affordable access are also key drivers of its rapid adoption.\nFor almost a decade, we have significantly invested in U.S. pharmacy channel access, including building the infrastructure, developing key pharmacy relationships, creating an easy onboarding pathway and building deep in-house expertise, all of which has resulted in a strong and leading channel access we have today. We continue to strengthen Omnipod's access and affordability, including our innovation pipeline that will go through this channel by building on our advantages.\nIn the U.S., Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q4, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, customer retention remains strong. The mix of U.S. new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps continued at an estimated 80-20 percentage split. Today, even with improved technology, most people using insulin still use MDI as their mode of care.\nMore than 60% of people with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. are on MDI and the vast majority of people with type 2 diabetes are using daily injections. Therefore, bringing people out of MDI and on to Omnipod remains the largest opportunity for us, and we continue to drive pump penetration and share gain in both the type 1 and type 2 markets, strengthening our leadership position. Omnipod 5 not only drove our #1 position for U.S. and customer starts in 2023, it was the most prescribed AID system in the U.S. This is because a growing number of health care providers are writing scripts for it.\nIn Q4, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 18,500, up from 17,000 in Q3. We speak with many HCPs and it is clear that Omnipod 5 is the winning choice for AIB. It is extremely gratifying to see the growing demand, confidence and adoption which have led to a growing number of scripts HCPs now write for our system. Our strong new customer starts included continuing adoption of Omnipod in the U.S. Type 2 diabetes market. We estimate that no more than 5% of people with type 2 diabetes who need intensive insulin therapy are currently using any kind of pump. And we know that we are already the market leader in that space.\nWe are confident that Omnipod will prove to be a simple and compelling solution for the millions of people globally with type 2 diabetes who today need insulin therapy as a part of their diabetes care regimen as well as the future millions who will naturally progress to requiring insulin as a part of their care. We are well positioned to bring all of the benefits of the Omnipod platform with people with type 2 diabetes both today and in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter, type 2 diabetes patients represented between 20% and 25% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod suite of products. While Omnipod DASH, with its type 2 indication for use is the leading insulin pump operating in this market, we look forward to marketing Omnipod 5 to type 2 patients once we have an expanded indication.\nThe underlying demand is apparent. We expect the last participant to complete our type 2 pivotal trial in the coming weeks, and we plan to submit results to the FDA by the end of 2024 for an expanded indication. We are confident this will be another catalyst that will fuel our growth trajectory, allow us to serve more patients and help us deliver on our mission. We look forward to sharing study results at ADA this June. The success of Omnipod 5, including its early yet powerful impact in 2 of our European markets, led to another strong quarter of new customer starts globally.\nInternationally, we realized a notable sequential increase in new customer starts, driven by the impact of Omnipod 5 that's having in the U.K. and Germany. Our early success in these countries supports our confidence that it will continue to transform diabetes care and position us as a market leader everywhere Omnipod 5 is available. We remain on track with our Omnipod 5 plus G6 European launch plans with the aim of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers by the end of 2024.\nWe are also thrilled to begin our journey launching Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott’s Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor. I'll speak to this new opportunity in a moment. In addition to our type 2 pivotal study progress, we are meaningfully advancing several other clinical initiatives. We are excited to attend the ATTD International Conference in Italy in a couple of weeks where we will present data for the Omnipod 5 + G6 randomized controlled trial. This RCT compared Omnipod 5 to non-AID pump and included study sites in the U.S. and France.\nWe are thrilled to have recently published in the Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics Journal real-world evidence from almost 70,000 people with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating Omnipod 5's effectiveness in a large, diverse population. The data are impressive and demonstrate the strength of the Omnipod 5 algorithm in the real world delivering leading time in range and very low hypoglycemia, reinforcing Omnipod 5 as the obvious choice for clinical outcomes and personalized diabetes care.\nCentral to everything we do is our mission to simplify life for people with diabetes. We want to make it easier for people to get prescribed therapy, get set up on therapy and use therapy consistently over time. This is the point of our evolution feasibility study taking place in New Zealand. Our intent is to have a next-generation algorithm that will further drive simplicity of use. We completed the first feasibility study in participants with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, commencing initially in supervised hotel setting and then progressing to at-home use.\nWe are pleased with the preliminary results and are analyzing the data and making modifications for the next round of subjects. We will present early feasibility results at ATTD. Lastly, we continue to actively enroll participants in our RADIANT study in France, the U.K. and Belgium, which is our Libre 2 integration trial. We began enrollment in September 2023, which is now halfway complete. Feedback has been tremendous and physicians new to Omnipod 5 appreciate its simplicity and potential to reach many more pump-naive users.\nAs a reminder, both our G6 and Libre 2 studies are designed to provide the evidence we need to elevate Omnipod 5 status as superior first-line therapy and help drive our pricing and market access initiatives as we further roll out Omnipod 5 with multiple sensors across our international markets. I'll now provide an update on our innovation progress and we'll focus on 3 key areas: expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod Go and building our digital and data capabilities.\nMany of you have heard us say that our current Omnipod 5 system is our \"minimum\" viable product. That's easy to forget given how quickly the market has adopted Omnipod 5 and made it the leading offer. Our current version is on only 1 operating system, Android. It is integrated with only 1 continuous glucose monitoring partner, Dexcom and until recently, was commercialized with only G6, and it contains our first-generation algorithm. This is about to change with platform extensions that will strengthen our leadership, deepen our competitive moats and allow us to open up Omnipod 5 to many more customers.\nTo start, we are excited to have commenced our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 over the last 2 weeks. This initial release will allow us time to test the market and build product at scale to prepare for what we are confident will be a very successful full market release of G7 this year. We anticipate an acceleration in new customer starts following a full launch, which will help to fuel our revenue growth more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond.\nWe are also on track with our planned limited market release of Omnipod 5 with Libre 2 Plus in the first half of this year in the Netherlands and U.K. made possible by the CE Mark approval we received earlier this month. We are excited that the option for customers to use Omnipod 5 with both G6 and Libre 2 Plus will enable us to reach many more patients. Our recent and upcoming CGM integrations are important milestones in providing choice to tens of thousands of customers who want to use Omnipod 5 and we believe both integrations will be a significant catalyst for our growth in 2024 and beyond.\nRounding out near-term innovation, we are planning for our U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 with the G6 system with our iOS app this year. This will mark a major innovation milestone because so many of our U.S. customers use Apple iPhone and prefer to carry only one phone. Another innovation that will allow us to reach more people and further expand our total addressable market is Omnipod GO, a solution designed for individuals with type 2 who naturally progress to requiring basal-only insulin and want a simple way to receive their daily dose, while avoiding the burden of injections.\nOur commercial pilot is underway, and it will help us refine our commercialization plans. Omnipod DASH has already made Insulet the leader in insulin delivery for people with type 2 diabetes. And with Omnipon GO, we are well positioned to move upstream in the patient care pathway. When we achieve clearance for Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market, we will bring all of the advantages of our AID system to this market. With these 3 products, our aim is to deliver an Omnipod portfolio that meets the full range of needs of people with Type 2 who require insulin as a part of their care.\nWe are excited about our innovation in the space and our ability to address the unmet needs that exist in this patient population. It is a massive global market that we expect will continue to grow, and we have the clear lead to pursue this market opportunity. We are also excited to build on our digital and data capabilities. One of the breakthrough features of Omnipod 5 is the real-time data provided by SIM cards in every controller. We constantly hear from physicians and patients how much they appreciate not needing to plug in for real-time usage data and 100% cloud connectivity has already given us the opportunity to publish the largest, real-world data set on AID.\nOver time, we plan to use the data to speed our product development, further improve the user experience, streamline physician workflows and build on our competitive advantages. We also continue building digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. In closing, Insulet continues to set the standard for the industry. With a strong 2023 behind us, we see multiple catalysts in the coming year and beyond. We are confident we will drive significant growth and continued success.\nI want to thank our Insulet global team for your dedication and deep passion for our customers and your commitment to delivering innovation. You are the reason for our success and our ability to continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren.\n\nLauren Budden\n\nGroup VP, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller & Interim CFO and Treasurer\n\nThanks, Jim. 2023 was another exciting year for Insulet, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We have strong momentum with many catalysts that will drive revenue growth and margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term. In Q4, we generated strong global, new customer starts fueled by the continued high demand for Omnipod 5, not only in the U.S. but also in our first 2 European markets. .\nAs a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 37% revenue growth in Q4, driven by global Omnipod growth of over 35%. We benefited from a shift in order timing and an increase in days on hand at certain pharmacy distributors, which I'll speak to in a moment. Without these benefits, our results still exceeded these guidance ranges. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 130 basis point tailwind compared to Q4 of last year.\nU.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 43%, which continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and the related premium for pods in the U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a benefit for the many reasons Jim spoke to, and our efforts to drive increased volume through this channel have resulted in almost all of our U.S. volume going through the pharmacy channel.\nThe recurring net volume benefit we recognized in Q4 from new customers who received their starter kits and first refill orders was in line with our expectations and remain consistent with Q3 levels. We expect this trend to continue. Also as expected, the same net volume benefit from existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 was immaterial since the vast majority had already previously converted. In Q4, U.S. revenue benefited from 2 dynamics not previously contemplated in our guidance.\nFirst, our largest U.S. pharmacy wholesalers collectively placed an estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated from the first quarter of 2024 in advance of our implementation of a new ERP system at the start of 2024. The second benefit was an increase in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $10 million to $15 million as pharmacy distributors returned to their normal levels.\nAs a reminder, in the first half of 2023, we called out a reduction in inventory days on hand below normal levels. What this boils down to is approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in Q4 that we had not anticipated, contributing approximately 12 points to our U.S. revenue growth. We are proud of our fourth quarter U.S. performance, especially given the tougher comparison due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of 2022.\nAdditionally, new customer starts in Q4 were slightly down from Q3 as expected as the market is moving from Dexcom's G6 sensor to G7. We are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. And as Jim shared, we expect new customer starts to accelerate throughout 2024 as we ramp our commercial efforts. Overall, our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5's success and continued robust demand. International Omnipod revenue increased 12.5%, which was above our expectations.\nGrowth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree, a benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, both of which drove notable increases in new customer starts. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 550 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 250 points favorable versus our guide. In Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remained stable.\nDrug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, representing a $5.5 million increase, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 70.9%, up over 1,200 basis points. Excluding the impact of the 2022 medical device corrections, adjusted gross margin increased 620 basis points to 70.7% in Q4 2023. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and product mix. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable mix that included a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. Partially offsetting the favorable contributors were expected higher production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses increased in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory, including gearing up for near-term product launches globally.\nAdjusted operating margin was 20.7% and adjusted EBITDA was 26.9% of revenue. Both were above our expectations, primarily due to the $30 million to $40 million revenue benefit I mentioned, which had an estimated 360 basis point favorable impact on adjusted operating margin. To a lesser extent, both outperformed due to our higher-than-expected gross margin.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with over $700 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. At the end of January, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B at a lower interest rate, which will reduce interest expense on an annualized basis by almost $2 million. We also achieved the milestone during the year of turning free cash flow positive, generating approximately $70 million in 2023. We continue to strengthen our financial position, giving us the flexibility to invest throughout our organization to drive long-term sustainable growth while at the same time expanding our margins and generating positive free cash flow.\nNow turning to our 2024 outlook. We continue to expect another year of large dollar growth even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023, most notably from our Omnipod 5 ramp. We expect to approach total company revenue of $2 billion at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 18% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 17%. As a reminder, our total company growth expectations exclude approximately 3 points due to the estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 21% driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in 2024, resulting from the significant 2 scripts and retail channel net stocking volume benefits in 2023. In addition, our expectations exclude approximately 4 points of growth due to the estimated orders that shifted into 2023. When factoring this into both periods, our normalized expectation for 2024 at the high end of our range is in line with the color we provided on our third quarter call of mid-20% growth.\nWe anticipate new customer starts in the first half of 2024 to be slightly lower than the levels we had in the second half of 2023 due to normal seasonality trends, and we expect an acceleration in the second half of 2024 following a full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. Also, as a reminder, estimated revenue from Omnipod 5 with our iOS app and from Omnipod GO is expected to be immaterial. We also currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more towards the second half of 2024 due to the timing of new customer starts, partially offset by the Q4 2023 stocking benefit.\nFor international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 10%, which is in line with the 2024 color we previously provided of high single digits. On a reported basis, we are assuming no foreign currency impact. We expect growth to be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany.\nWe expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. We are excited to enter our first European markets in the first half of 2024, with Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in another market around the same time.\nAs a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect these launches to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in 2025. We continue to expect the first half of the year to be in the high single digits range and to accelerate in the second half of the year to a range of high single digits to low double digits, primarily due to a more meaningful contribution from our Omnipod 5 U.K. and Germany launches and, to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024.\nLastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect a 50% to 60% decline in line with the 2024 color we previously provided. Turning to 2024 gross margin. We expect a range of 68% to 69% and anticipated benefit from favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are higher costs associated with our new product launches.\nWe expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half due to accelerating revenue throughout the year and continued manufacturing efficiencies. In 2024, we plan to expand both gross and operating margins while driving market growth. We expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D and clinical and expand our sales force and other functions to support our commercial efforts and growth initiatives, including our near-term product lines. Our sales force expansion includes hiring some reps specifically focused on pediatrics, a population for which Omnipod has always captured a large share.\nEven with increased investments, we have many opportunities to significantly expand margins and increase shareholder value, and we remain committed to doing just that. We expect operating margin to be approximately 13%, up approximately 100 basis points from 2023 adjusted operating margin. When factoring in the 130 basis point year-over-year unfavorable impact in 2024 from the $20 million to $25 million shift in order timing, we expect operating margins to be approximately 200 basis points higher in 2024 over 2023.\nWe expect operating margin to significantly improve in the second half of the year over the first half due to revenue ramping during the year and continued manufacturing improvements. We have many catalysts for growth in 2024 and considerable opportunities to drive further margin expansion over the near and long term coming from scaling the business efficiently even with the continued focused investments in our robust innovation pipeline and commercial efforts. We expect capital expenditures to almost double from 2023 due to the timing of spend to support our planned 2024 production at our new Malaysia manufacturing facility as well as investments to support continuous improvement efforts in our other manufacturing locations and to a lesser degree, investment in IT infrastructure.\nTurning to our first quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 15% to 18% and total company growth of 17% to 20%. Our total company revenue expectations exclude approximately 6 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 19% to 22%, which excludes over 8 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points.\nFinally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $5 million to $6 million. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter and year of significant financial performance and strategic execution. We have strong momentum at the start of 2024 with many catalysts ahead and as a result, we are in a fantastic position to continue to grow and efficiently scale our business. The global market opportunities for Insulet are tremendous, and we will continue to invest in innovation with an increased commitment to significant margin expansion. We are well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and to deliver on our mission for our customers.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Budden, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nBoth the replay of this call and the press release discussing our quarterly results and our guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our third quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another strong quarter for Insulet with rapid growth and achievement of many strategic milestones. Thanks to our global team's execution, dedication and focus, we are on track to complete another transformational year and enter 2024 with significant momentum.\nOn today's call, I want to do 3 things: discuss our financial results and market traction, provide an update on our continuing progress in clinical and market access work, and review key developments in our innovation pipeline.\nOur third quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of over 27%, including U.S. growth of 35%. We also achieved total company growth of 25%. These are remarkable results, especially coming in the context of our strong prior year comparables. As a result, we raised guidance once again for the full year.\nPerformance was driven primarily by the huge success of Omnipod 5, our revolutionary automated insulin delivery system. It is gratifying to see the positive impact Omnipod 5 is having as it continues to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes, and we are only in the early innings.\nQ3 represented the anniversary of the U.S. launch of our Omnipod 5 platform. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA-cleared, fully disposable, pod-based AID system, and it continues to transform diabetes management. Its simplicity, ease of use, widespread and affordable access and improved real-world outcomes have made Omnipod 5 the leading AID offering on the market.\nWith the added benefits of U.S. pharmacy channel access, pay-as-you-go model and an easy onboarding pathway, Omnipod 5 makes it simple and efficient for health care practitioners, patients and payers to conveniently prescribe, access and afford our breakthrough technology.\nWe are now also beginning the global rollout of Omnipod 5 in our international markets, starting with the U.K. this past June. With 1 full quarter under our belts in the U.K., we are seeing very strong early adoption. In Q3, Omnipod 5 drove accelerated new customer starts in the U.K., taking revenue growth to almost 45% year-over-year and driving approximately 70% sequential growth in new customer starts. It's a strong early sign of the global power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes care.\nDuring Q3, we also commenced the rollout of Omnipod 5 in Germany in August, and early momentum is exciting. Based on these results, we are confident that Omnipod 5 will emerge as the market-leading offer everywhere it is available.\nThe success of Omnipod 5 led to another outstanding quarter of new customer starts both in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q3, and customer retention remains strong. In the U.S. in Q3, Omnipod new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 80-20 percentage split, which is in line with our historical mix.\nOmnipod was specifically designed for individuals on MDI and as expected, we are driving pump penetration across all age groups in both the type 1 and type 2 markets while also growing our share, positioning Insulet as a leader in these markets. We estimate that we are the clear leader, bringing customers into the market from MDI.\nIn addition to growing awareness of Omnipod and high product demand among patients, a growing number of HCPs are writing scripts for it. In Q3, we saw another increase in prescribers, growing to over 17,000, up from over 15,000 in Q2. In a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists, this shows the broad appeal and ease of prescription of Omnipod 5. Importantly, this extensive reach is critical to access patients who are not seen at the high-volume pump-prescribing clinics that historically defines the pump market.\nOmnipod 5's broad appeal is also evidenced by the growing number of scripts that these HCPs write for our system. Omnipod loyalty amongst Podders has been a hallmark of our brand for many years, and it is great to see the growing demand and confidence amongst the prescribing HCPs. In fact, an increasing number tell us that when given the choice, their patients overwhelmingly choose Omnipod.\nOur results in Q3 also strengthen our conviction that we'll be able to reach the millions of people with type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy as a part of their care. In the quarter, Omnipod adoption in the type 2 market continued at a steady pace with type 2 patients representing approximately 20% of our U.S. new customer starts. These new customer starts come from across our Omnipod portfolio of products, demonstrating the clear benefits that our products offer the type 2 population.\nOmnipod DASH continues to be the leading insulin pump offer with an indication for use in the type 2 market. While we can't yet market Omnipod 5 for type 2, the obvious underlying demand for AID in the type 2 market is encouraging. And we look forward to bringing Omnipod 5 to these customers once we complete our pivotal trial and secure an extension to our existing indication for use.\nAnd to that end, we are very excited to announce that we have reached our enrollment goal this week in our U.S. type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this is a study of up to 400 participants with a 13-week protocol comparing Omnipod 5 to participants' previous therapy. The feedback from HCPs and study participants continues to be very strong and strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will have a big impact in the critically underserved population of type 2 patients who require insulin. We will provide further updates as the trial progresses.\nI'd like to make a few comments about the ongoing debate about the impact of GLP-1s on our markets. As we've made clear, we regard the GLP-1 class of drugs as an important innovation for people with type 2 diabetes, and they have been indicated for use in type 2 diabetes for several years. These drugs help many of the same patients we aim to help, and we applaud their innovation.\nFurther, as a reminder, we believe GLP-1s do not materially impact our end markets. They are not indicated for use in type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disorder, and there is no apparent mechanism for them to impact the course of type 1 as a condition. Likewise, there is no apparent mechanism for GLP-1 drugs to alter the underlying progression of beta cell decline that is characteristic of type 2 diabetes.\nLast month, we published a short slide presentation going into these issues in more detail. This week, we published an update to those slides based upon data that was recently presented at EASD. In a large retrospective study of 23,000 users of semaglutide, the evidence presented suggests 3 important conclusions.\nFirst, semaglutide has almost identical impact on glycemic control as liraglutide in terms of the magnitude and duration of A1c reduction. Second, this real-world evidence shows a very clear relationship between dose adherence and glycemic control, such that only the most adherent users receive the level of benefit that has been demonstrated in more controlled clinical settings. Finally and importantly, weight loss and the persistence of weight loss for semaglutide users in this study was demonstrated to be independent of glycemic control.\nIn short, real-world evidence shows that patients using semaglutide continue to have their diabetes progress with limited or no incremental duration of effect over previous drugs, and type 2 diabetes continues to progress even with weight loss. For those who are interested in more detail, we refer you to our updated presentation, which is available on the Insulet Investor page.\nThese data reinforce our existing view. Because the underlying disease continues to progress, most people with type 2 diabetes will eventually need to incorporate insulin into their therapy. Insulet is incredibly well positioned to serve these customers as they progress in their condition and need to add first basal and then intensive insulin into their treatment.\nWe are already winning in this market, and we continue to have strong conviction that people with type 2 diabetes represent a large and underserved population. We are continuing our efforts to bring the full power of a broad portfolio of insulin delivery options, including Omnipod DASH, Omnipod 5 and Omnipod GO, which I will come back to in a few moments.\nIn addition to our type 2 pivotal trial, we are progressing several additional clinical initiatives. We are pleased to have completed the protocol with the last participant in our randomized controlled trial using Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6. We're in the process of analyzing and preparing the data, which we expect to show the clear benefits of Omnipod 5 therapy over non-AID systems.\nWe are also making great progress with the RADIANT study, which is our Libre 2 integration trial, for which we began enrollment in September. Clinicians have remarked about the simplicity and ease of transition for MDI users to Omnipod 5 in the outpatient setting, including in regions where it is often the norm for AID therapy to occur in the hospital for days due to the complexity of existing tubed pump offerings. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre 2 sensor has advanced to the point where study participants are using the system. Both of these studies will provide the evidence we need to drive pricing and market access initiatives as we launch Omnipod 5 across our international markets.\nI'd now like to turn to 3 key areas of innovation for us: expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod GO, and driving the future of AID with our advanced algorithm program. The widespread success of Omnipod 5 makes it easy to forget that the current version of our offering is in some ways our minimum viable product. In order to achieve the full promise of the platform, our aim is to expand on customer choice both for phone control and for CGM use.\nIn that context, we are excited to have received FDA clearance for our 510(k) for the Omnipod iOS app. This is another major innovation milestone for Insulet, and iOS is one of the most requested features from our customers. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to provide the iOS option to our existing Omnipod 5 customer base as well as future customers. Because the iOS app represents a completely new software platform, we expect to begin a U.S. limited market release in early 2024. And upon successful completion, we will make iOS for Omnipod 5 broadly available as soon as possible.\nWith regard to CGM, our efforts to expand our sensor integrations with our partners, Dexcom and Abbott, continue to steadily progress. I've already mentioned our progress with Libre sensor integration in the context of our European trial. We are also hard at work to complete our integration with Dexcom's G7 sensor, and we are excited to announce that we are planning for a limited market release of Omnipod 5 plus G7 also in early 2024. Omnipod 5 is the market-leading offer. And with these coming innovations, we are confident we will be able to maintain and extend that leadership.\nA key innovation effort that moves us upstream from AID is Omnipod GO, which is designed to radically simplify the initiation of basal insulin therapy for people who need to start insulin as their type 2 diabetes progresses. Even small penetration into this market will meaningfully contribute to our long-term growth trajectory. We have commenced the commercial pilot for Omnipod GO in the U.S., which includes HCPs that we don't typically call on who are new to Omnipod, most of whom who are primary care physicians.\nOur commercial pilot is providing us with the opportunity to present Omnipod GO and also to educate PCPs on all of our Omnipod offerings. Although early in our pilot, PCPs are telling us that Pod therapy is much easier than pump therapy. As a result, these HCPs want to learn about the entire Omnipod portfolio. We expect both Omnipod GO and Omnipod DASH to make the treatment pathway far easier for these type 2 patients. Learnings from our ongoing Omnipod GO commercial pilot will help us to refine our plans for commercialization in 2024.\nWe are continuing to progress work on our next-generation AID algorithm with our Evolution feasibility trial, which we began earlier in the year and which is being conducted in New Zealand. The goal of this feasibility study is to test potential enhancements to the Omnipod 5 algorithm in order to further drive simplicity of use. We've been able to launch this study very early in the life cycle of our AID offerings specifically because of the unique aspects of Omnipod 5, both because the on-market algorithm is highly effective and because of our ability to gather actual usage data from essentially the entire population of Omnipod 5 users. We expect that cloud connectivity for -- of Omnipod 5, coupled with our data sciences capabilities, will allow us to materially accelerate our algorithm development efforts over time.\nFinally, an important update on our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. In August, we filed a suit in the U.S. against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the misappropriation of Insulet's proprietary trade secrets. Last month, after requesting preliminary relief and obtaining some initial evidence, the court granted our request for a preliminary injunction against EOFlow, which prohibits EOFlow from manufacturing, marketing or selling to any new customer any product that we designed, developed or manufactured using or relying on Insulet's trade secrets.\nThe court also extended the prior injunction issue to restrain EOFlow from disclosing to any third-party information that contains, derives from or incorporates Insulet's confidential information. In granting Insulet's motion, the court found \"very substantial, indeed, strong evidence of misappropriation\" and \"that Insulet is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secrets claim.\"\nWe have invested considerable resources over many years developing our Omnipod products, and we are confident we have a clear lead technically and in terms of scalability. We will continue to vigorously defend our IP to protect those investments.\nIn closing, we completed another outstanding quarter, and we have sustained momentum across our business. We are enjoying continued rapid growth in the U.S. type 1 market, and we're seeing accelerating adoption in our international markets where Omnipod 5 is launched. We are also seeing continued growth in the type 2 market across our Omnipod offerings. We are excited about the catalysts coming in 2024 with iOS functionality CGM-integrated Omnipod GO that unlock a lot of market growth for many years to come.\nI want to thank our entire Insulet global team for their engagement and hard work as we continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world.\nBefore I turn the call over to Lauren, I want to welcome and congratulate her on her role as our Interim CFO and Treasurer. Lauren is our Chief Accounting Officer and has been with Insulet for close to 5 years. She has long been a key member of our finance team and has contributed significant value to the company and to shareholders during her tenure with us. We are thrilled to have Lauren in this role to support our continued execution of our strategic priorities.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Lauren.\n\nLauren Budden\n\nGroup VP, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller & Interim CFO and Treasurer\n\nThanks so much, Jim. It's an honor to serve as interim CFO. As Jim shared, Insulin achieved another quarter of robust growth, financial performance and strategic progress. We once again delivered strong global new customer starts, fueled by huge demand for Omnipod 5 in the U.S. And we are seeing a very nice uptick in new customer starts in the international markets where we launched Omnipod 5.\nAs a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 25% revenue growth in Q3, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of over 27%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 180 basis point tailwind compared to Q3 last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 35% and exceeded our guidance range.\nRevenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increase in volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH and the related premium for Pods in the U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a competitive advantage, and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q3 represented between 90% and 95% of our total U.S. volume.\nOmnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net tailwind of approximately $10 million, which is in line with what we expected for Q3 guidance. As a reminder, since our launch, we have realized a recurring net volume benefit from new customers as well as from Omnipod customers converting to Omnipod 5, many of whom received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter, plus some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Our estimates have been net of those Omnipod 5 customers who skipped an order in the period.\nIn Q3, as we expected, the volume benefit from conversions has been normalizing and was therefore immaterial as the majority of our existing customers already switched to Omnipod 5. Going forward, we expect continued benefit from the 2 script dynamics as we drive Omnipod 5 new customer starts.\nIn Q3, U.S. attrition and global utilization remained stable. International Omnipod revenue increased 8%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and, to a smaller degree, incremental benefit from our Omnipod 5 launch in the U.K., which drove a notable increase in new customer starts. These benefits were partially offset by slightly higher attrition as we continue to be impacted by AID competition, including lower distributor orders.\nOn a reported basis, foreign currency was a 720 basis point tailwind over the prior year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 27%, which was slightly below our guidance range due to a lower forecast from our partners. Gross margin was 67.8%, up over 1,200 basis points and included income of $1.9 million due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year when we took a charge of approximately $37 million in Q3 last year. Excluding both, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 67.3% in Q3 of this year. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue.\nThe year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiency and a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. These increases were partially offset by expected higher production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production.\nOperating expenses were up year-over-year, in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin was 12.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 19.1%. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $1.9 million and were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $685 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our innovation pipeline and other key areas of our organization in order to build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth.\nNow turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 29% to 30% and total company revenue growth to a range of 26% to 27%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to a range of 37% to 38%. This increase is primarily driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption stemming from consecutive strong new customer starts and, to a lesser extent, ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as from recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel.\nAs a reminder, Q4 of last year was the first full quarter of Omnipod 5 sales, contributing to a tougher comparison in the fourth quarter of this year. The prior year included the 2-script benefit, which was in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. It also included retail channel stocking.\nFor International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance range and now expect 9% to 10% growth. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 100 basis points. We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption as well as the benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds.\nAs a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect Omnipod 5 to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our guidance range of a 45% to 50% decline.\nTurning to 2023 gross margin. We are raising our adjusted gross margin expectations to a range of 66% to 67% and expect to achieve the midpoint of this range. The increase from our prior guide is driven by improved manufacturing costs as well as higher-than-expected revenue, including favorable mix. Although certain headwinds that we experienced during 2023 will carry over into next year, we expect to see further gross margin improvement in 2024. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 9% to 10% given our revenue and gross margin outperformance. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond.\nTurning to our fourth quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod and total company growth of 22% to 25%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 28% to 31%. Even with the challenging comp due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of last year, our new customers start momentum and the benefits of our annuity model continue to fuel our revenue growth, including strong expected sequential dollar growth in Q4.\nFor International Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 300 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $5 million due to timing of production and orders.\nWe have sustained momentum across our business, and we are poised for another strong year in 2024. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our Q4 call in February, I will provide some color now on how we are thinking about 2024 given the strong momentum we see in the business.\nWe anticipate another year of large dollar growth in 2024 even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023 from our Omnipod 5 ramp. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect a growth rate within the mid-20% range, fueled by Omnipod 5 and its strong pace of new customer starts as well as our annuity model and pharmacy channel access.\nFor International, we expect continued growth with Omnipod DASH and more meaningful growth towards the second half of the year from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. All in, that puts us somewhere in the high single digits for the year with the second half of the year accelerating to a range of high single digits to low double digits. For Drug Delivery, we expect to see a decline, and at the high end of the forecast, we expect the decline to be lower than in 2023.\nIn conclusion, we delivered another quarter of solid financial performance, and we further positioned Insulet for continued momentum through the end of this year and beyond. As we continue to capitalize on the global market opportunity and invest in innovation, we're poised for another strong year of customer base growth and revenue growth. Opportunities of this magnitude are few and far between, and we are very well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you joining us for Insulet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our quarterly results and our guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our second quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange.\nThese measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis, with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, we enjoyed another quarter of sustained strong momentum, and we remain on track for another successful and transformative year. The entire global Insulet team is executing at a high level, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance while also achieving several key strategic and innovation milestones. On today's call, I'll touch on 4 main topics: our strong financial performance, our consumer-focused innovation and clinical achievements, how we're continuing to drive penetration of a massive market opportunity with expanded access and awareness and the Omnipod 5 international launch.\nStarting with our financial performance. Our second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 33%, including U.S. growth of 41%. We also achieved total company growth of 32%. Because of these terrific results, we've raised our outlook for the year. Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology market as the only FDA-approved fully disposable, pod-based automated insulin delivery system. Our flagship offering continues to be the major driver of U.S. revenue growth and was responsible for another record quarter of U.S. and global new customer starts. And Omnipod 5 represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts.\nBuilding on our success in the U.S., we are very pleased to have completed the commercial launch of Omnipod 5 in the United Kingdom. We are excited to bring our unmatched AID system to our first international market. Our plans to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany are on track for this fall with a broader staged rollout across our European markets in 2024.\nWe also meaningfully advanced our clinical and innovation initiatives during the second quarter. We had a formidable presence at ADA in June where we presented compelling new real-world data from the first year on Omnipod 5 in the U.S. for both type 1 and type 2 users. In addition, our U.S. type 2 pivotal and U.S. France randomized controlled trials are progressing well.\nOn the innovation side, we are thrilled to have submitted our 510(k) to the FDA for the Omnipod 5 iOS app for the iPhone. iOS phone control is one of the most requested features from our customers, and we look forward to bringing this new offering to market in the near term. We entered the second half of the year with clear momentum in our business and a focused strategy to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nCentral to everything we do is our drive to deliver consumer-focused innovation. That is why we are incredibly excited about Omnipod 5 and the game-changing technology and experience it delivers. Its benefits are clear: simple and easy-to-use technology, an unmatched form factor and customer experience, affordability and broad access through the pharmacy channel and notably, strong real-world clinical outcomes. Omnipod 5 continues to have very broad appeal and is attracting substantial new customer starts across all age groups.\nIn Q2, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 75-25 percentage split compared to our historical 80-20 mix. We continue to capture significant tubed pump switches while also growing pump adoption from those coming from MDI, which is what our Omnipod brand of products was specifically designed for. Omnipod 5 adoption isn't the only evidence of considerable impact on the diabetes community. We are also seeing stable retention rates.\nWe also saw a sizable increase in the number of HCPs who wrote scripts for Omnipod 5 in Q2, which was over 15,000, up from over 11,000 in Q1. That is in a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists. The power of Omnipod 5 is also illustrated by the ongoing feedback we receive across the diabetes community from Podders to their parents and loved ones to HCPs and other caregivers. We recently heard from a Podder, who said, \"Since switching Omnipod 5, I have never looked back.\" And an endo at a very large clinic recently informed us that he has changed how he communicates with his type 1 patients. He now strongly recommends AID therapy for all, and in the clear majority of cases, they choose Omnipod 5.\nOur success building awareness of and access to Omnipod is core to our strategy and ability to continue to lead in the type 1 and type 2 markets, both of which remain vastly underpenetrated. The market opportunity is massive. Excitingly, we see Omnipod 5 already contributing to overall pump adoption in the U.S., reinforcing our confidence that Omnipod will drive pump penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone from the approximate 40% where it is today.\nThe U.S. pharmacy channel also remains a key driver of our success, expanding access to Omnipod in the United States. The pharmacy channel simplifies the overall experience for patients and provides more affordable, convenient and efficient access. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it on par with the customer cost for MDI. And we continue to hear from our customers how convenient it is to get their pod through this channel. We are capturing the market opportunity and improving the lives of our customers through not only our advanced technology and clinical outcomes but also our product's convenience and simplicity.\nThis quarter, we significantly advanced our clinical initiatives. We had fantastic representation at ADA, including standing room-only at our product theater and a record number of leads at our booth. We presented Omnipod 5 real-world evidence demonstrating improved outcomes for children, adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes, and for the first time, Omnipod 5 real-world data for adults with type 2. The combined real-world data included 60,000 individuals across all age groups. Every day, we are building real-world evidence that undoubtedly demonstrates that our advanced algorithm and overall system is working exactly as it was designed and improving customer lives.\nOur real-world data will be incredibly powerful over time since every Omnipod 5 user is cloud connected. We can continue to personalize and improve the overall customer experience while also streamlining physician workflows. We will have unprecedented insight into actual population-level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and to build on our already market-leading product differentiation. Every day, we are building usage data from our rapidly growing Omnipod 5 customer base, and we will be able to use this private secure de-identified data to constantly improve the customer care experience from diagnosis all the way through the course of their lives. We'll be able to learn from usage patterns, increasingly segment our offerings and drive coaching engines.\nTo put it simply, the better we make the customer experience and streamline workflows, the more we'll have product preference, the more data we'll have and it will effectively be a data flywheel that builds on itself. This is where we will continue to lead. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy.\nAs we also mentioned at ADA, we expect to begin enrollment in a matter of weeks for a trial using Omnipod 5 with the FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM, which will include up to 200 participants with type 1 diabetes across 18 institutions in the U.K., France and Belgium. It will be a 13-week randomized controlled trial, including those currently on MDI with the primary endpoint of change in A1c. Although not needed from a regulatory perspective, we expect the data from this trial to support our pricing and access initiatives. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre is far along and has advanced to the point where we will soon place study participants on the integrated system.\nWe also announced our first feasibility study of a next-generation AID algorithm which will take place in New Zealand and for which recruitment began last month. This 11-week study will include up to 72 participants aged 16 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and is designed to assess safety and effectiveness. Our new algorithm work is informed by our incredibly strong usage data, which allows us to continue to advance our system in even more ways than we had originally envisioned.\nWe advanced other major clinical programs during Q2, including our type 2 pivotal study, for which we expect to complete enrollment by the end of the year. As a reminder, this is a 3-month study of up to 350 people, making it the largest type 2 study we have conducted. The feedback we have received from HCPs and study participants is encouraging. HCPs are impressed with how well participants are doing on Omnipod 5, and the participants have strongly expressed their desire to stay on product after the trial's completion. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a game changer for people with type 2 diabetes, and we are confident Omnipod 5 can have an even greater impact on this underserved population.\nLastly, our final participant in France is on track to soon complete our Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6 randomized controlled trial. Once complete, we will analyze and prepare the data to negotiate access and premium pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. We expect providing this data will be one of many initiatives that will support our Omnipod 5 international commercial launches, which are now underway.\nWhile Omnipod 5 is disrupting diabetes management today and is expected to do so for a long time to come, we know a robust innovation pipeline is necessary to drive sustainable long-term growth. We will soon begin our Omnipod GO U.S. limited commercial rollout, which will also include HCPs whom we don't typically call upon and that are \"new to Omnipod.\" This will allow us to test the market and expand our reach. This new-to-market simplified product will grant us access earlier in the type 2 pathway and addresses critical barriers that can prevent the initiation of insulin therapy, namely fear of needles as well as challenges with dosing accuracy and consistency.\nOmnipod GO will expand our addressable market by at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone who require basal-only insulin. We look forward to the key learnings from our pilot program, which will help inform our full market release in 2024. We are very well positioned in the type 2 market to grow adoption with Omnipod DASH and soon, Omnipod GO, not to mention an expected future type 2 indication for Omnipod 5. We certainly have a number of competitive advantages in this space, including our differentiated form factor, an affordable pay-as-you-go business model and pharmacy channel access. As a result, we continue to add a substantial number of type 2 patients to our customer base.\nDuring Q2, people with type 2 diabetes represented an estimated 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. Given the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, our type 1 customer base is growing at an incredible rate, far outpacing type 2. However, on an absolute basis, our type 2 new customer starts increased sequentially.\nWe achieved another major innovation milestone in June with our 510(k) submission for the Omnipod 5 iOS app. The FDA's review is progressing, and we look forward to continuing to work with the agency so we can provide the iOS platform option to our expanding Omnipod 5 customer base. We are also advancing our integration efforts with both of our CGM partners, allowing us to provide future CGM of choice with Omnipod 5, which we firmly believe is the best AID system on the market. We expect these integrations will be one of many catalysts that fuel our long-term growth and strengthen our value proposition and, most importantly, allow us to continue to execute our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nWe continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. We also actively defend our valuable portfolio of proprietary technologies and innovations as appropriate. As you may know, earlier this year, we successfully took legal action against the distribution of EOFlow's product in Germany. In that case, the court determined that EOFlow infringes Insulet's unique technologies, and the court quickly issued an injunction prohibiting EOFlow's distributor from further infringing on our patents in Germany. Subsequently, after further investigation, we filed an additional suit last week in the U.S. against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the continued misappropriation of our valuable and proprietary trade secrets as well as the infringement of our patents and other IP.\nWe not only will enforce our patents when necessary, we also will zealously protect our valuable trade secrets. We are confident we have a clear lead both technically and in terms of scalability, and we will not hesitate to vigorously defend our IP when we see followers misappropriating or infringing on it in an attempt to catch up.\nMoving on to our international operations. We are excited to have commercially launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. in June. While it has only been a brief period of time, the market response has been fantastic. Following launch, we saw an almost doubling of our typical customer order rates. And we quickly started a considerable number of Omnipod 5 users throughout last month alone, including both new customers as well as those already on brand. We are thrilled to provide our advanced technology to those who have long been waiting for it. We remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany this fall, closer to the beginning of the season with a broader staged international rollout in 2024. By the end of 2024, our goal is to have Omnipod 5 available for the majority of our European customers.\nIn closing, we've reached the midpoint of 2023 and have incredible momentum in our business. We are delivering strong financial performance and achieving key strategic milestones. We have advanced our commercial, innovation and clinical programs and Omnipod 5 and our entire business shows no signs of slowing down. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry in advanced innovation.\nIt's gratifying that others in the industry see our leadership and are attempting to follow our established best-in-class fully disposable patch form factor. We are investing for sustained leadership and widespread international expansion. We are transforming diabetes management, and we are only beginning to drive our life-changing innovations to market. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance and strategic progress and once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts. We generated 32% revenue growth in Q2, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of 33%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 20 basis point tailwind compared to Q2 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 41%, exceeding our guidance range.\nRevenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with consecutive record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where we provide the Personal Diabetes Manager at no charge. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net headwind of approximately $4 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $16 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers, in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter, as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies.\nThis estimate is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $13 million and another $7 million reduction associated with an increase in actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. The benefit of the pharmacy channel continues to be a competitive advantage, and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q2 represented over 90% of our total U.S. volume.\nInternational Omnipod revenue increased 15%, in line with our expectations. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH in our international markets as well as a combination of items associated with order and revenue recognition timing that contributed approximately 300 basis points of growth. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind over the prior year. Our estimated global attrition and utilization remain consistent. Our delivery revenue increased 18%, above the high end of our guidance range due to favorable production fees and timing.\nGross margin was 66.8%, up approximately 320 basis points. Cost of revenue included income of $800,000 due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 66.6%, slightly above our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue, including favorable mix. The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel, improved manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in warranty expense. These were partially offset by higher costs associated with Omnipod 5 production, higher expected production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production, as well as inflation.\nOperating expenses were up year-over-year to support higher-than-expected revenue and investments in our business to further drive our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 7.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $800,000, and both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $660 million in cash. In June, we extended our credit facility 4 years and increased our borrowing capacity under the facility to $300 million, all of which is currently available. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our expanding pipeline and other key areas of our organization and build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth.\nNow turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 25% to 28% and total company revenue growth of 22% to 25%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to 33% to 36%, driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both record new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel.\nAs a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 U.S. full market release which started in August of last year. This includes the related 2 script and retail channel stocking volume benefits, which were in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect 7% to 10% constant currency growth. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 300 basis points.\nWe expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We are excited to have kicked off our Omnipod 5 international rollout. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect the Omnipod 5 launches to start inflecting in our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect a decline of 50% to 45%, representing a dollar decline similar to what we experienced in 2022.\nTurning to 2023 gross margin. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts to gross margin include increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, geographical sales mix and improved manufacturing. These drivers are expected to be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation. As we've previously stated, we expect many of these factors to continue to impact our results into 2024. However, we expect gradual improvement over the course of the coming years. We still expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range.\nGiven our market leadership position and large unpenetrated market opportunities, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise with investments in our commercial, innovation and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We are reaffirming our guide of adjusted operating margin of high single digits and expect it to be closer to the high end of the range. We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross profit. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022.\nTurning to our third quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 20% to 23% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. Our growth drivers remain the same: the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel, and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. With strong new customer start momentum, we continue to accelerate sequentially and, as a result, are guiding to strong sequential dollar growth in Q3.\nFor international Omnipod, we expect growth of 2% to 5% driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and a modest contribution from our Omnipod 5 launch, partially offset by increasing AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 800 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q3 Drug Delivery revenue decline of 30% to 25%.\nIn conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance, achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. We're on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer starts while also investing in key areas throughout our global business in order to drive sustainable growth and long-term value creation. With that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call.\nBoth a replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2023 first quarter results and guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our first quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements and our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance. And we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident of Sleep Business, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're off to a great start to 2023. We entered the year with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business, and the Insulet team continues to execute and deliver on our ambitious expectations.\nWe expect 2023 to be another year of strong growth and strategic progress. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, and today, we increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year.\nWe achieved another record first quarter for U.S. revenue growth of 49% and 35% for total Omnipod and once again delivered another record for U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. Omnipod 5 continues to be a driving force of our strong U.S. growth, and in Q1, it represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts. This revolutionary offering is transforming diabetes management.\nLast week, we also received FDA clearance for our basal-only Pod named Omnipod GO. This is a unique product for the type 2 market. It provides us with early entry into treatment pathway, gives physicians and people with diabetes a comfortable non-injection option to deliver and receive insulin and provides patients an improved experience. By eliminating the personal diabetes manager and offering preset levels of basal insulin, we are easing patients into insulin management while leveraging Omnipod's comfortable tubeless technology. We're excited about bringing this innovation to market in 2024.\nNow to Omnipod 5, which continues to disrupt the diabetes market with its elegance and ease of use as well as consistently impressive real-world outcomes. It has strengthened our position as the market leader by revenue and is rapidly helping us take leadership among new pump prescriptions, thanks to our high share of multiple daily injection new starts and the large number of customer switches from competitive tubed offerings.\nIn Q1, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from MDI and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 70-30 split compared to our historical 80-20 mix as a result of the strong number of competitive switches we continue to capture. Omnipod 5's ease-of-use, simplified access, quality of life and strong clinical outcomes, coupled with our team's execution, has positioned us to continue to win across all market segments.\nOmnipod 5 is truly unmatched compared to other AID systems, and the feedback we hear from customers speaks to its unique benefits. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who operates a clinic with almost 3,000 patients across both type 1 and type 2, many of whom use one of our Omnipod solutions. He has hundreds of patients now on Omnipod 5, and he is using it himself. He called Omnipod 5 a \"game changer\" and said \"Thank you for everything you do. I've waited 40 years for this product, and it's more than what I had hoped for.\"\nThis sentiment is echoed by so many HCPs, who tell us that their Omnipod 5 patients span all age groups, including people over the age of 80 who have been on MDI for decades and would never have considered pumps before learning about and experiencing Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nMuch of this success is a testament to how we designed our system. As we do with all of our innovations, we designed Omnipod 5 with the customer 100% in mind with a clear focus on how we could simplify each day, improve quality of life and drive better outcomes.\nWe offer an algorithm that provides micro doses every 5 minutes to adjust the target versus other systems that need to adjust basal rates or give correction boluses. Plus with Omnipod 5, there is no need to disconnect. Our algorithm learns, adapts and personalizes for each user. Our users are able to achieve excellent time in range with the lowest incidence of hypoglycemia on the market.\nThe real-world evidence we shared at ATTD with data from more than 31,000 Omnipod 5 users is unmatched by competitors. And we look forward to sharing a larger data set at the ADA Trade Show next month, building on the clinical outcomes and quality of life that only Omnipod 5 can provide.\nThese clinical outcomes, combined with Omnipod 5's form factor and ease of use, are proving to be life-changing for our users. Our market leadership also depends on building awareness of and access to Omnipod. And our team continues to execute with excellence against these objectives.\nOur efforts to drive access and awareness are critically important, given how underpenetrated the global type 1 and type 2 pump markets are, driving growing need for advanced solutions. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are approximately 11 million people with insulin-intensive diabetes who can benefit from Omnipod. Approximately 45% have type 1 and 55% type 2, and these markets remain vastly underserved.\nPump penetration in the U.S. type 1 market is still only approximately 40% and only low single digits in type 2, and international market penetration is much below the U.S. There is a massive unmet need for insulin therapy solutions, which also means we have a massive market opportunity.\nThe Omnipod platform and especially Omnipod 5 will open that market even further. Prior to Omnipod 5, consensus was there was a natural cap on pump adoption of around 70%, but these estimates have all been built based upon the adoption curve of tubed pumps.\nYou've heard us call Omnipod 5 a game changer, and we believe it changes this game. Omnipod 5's simplicity, ease of use, cost and access and importantly, outstanding clinical outcomes driven by our advanced algorithm will allow us to bring customers into the market who would have otherwise never considered or never been considered for an insulin pump. We are seeing this in our market feedback already.\nAdditionally, CGM is helping to pave the way by raising awareness for Omnipod. And in turn, we are bringing more people to CGM. Our sources indicate CGM U.S. type 1 market penetration is nearing 80%, making us even more confident in Omnipod 5's potential to grow penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone.\nThe Omnipod platform is quickly becoming the new standard of care for insulin delivery. A critical element to our access strategy is growing our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. This makes access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH much more affordable, convenient and efficient with low co-pays and the ability to pick up product at the local pharmacy or through mail order with no lock-in periods. And the vast majority of Omnipod 5 prescriptions are filled in a matter of days compared to weeks through the DME channel.\nIn the U.S. market, we price Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH to drive access for Omnipod 5 quickly so we can make it affordable for the large number of people we knew would want it. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it relatively on par with customer costs for multiple daily injections.\nCombined with no upfront cost to start on Omnipod 5, we invite any patient to experience the difference of Omnipod. Omnipod 5, just like Omnipod DASH, is widely covered in the U.S. Our team's customer-centric focus and commitment to operational excellence enabled us to drive incredibly strong coverage for Omnipod 5 in a short period of time, positioning us for the enormous level of affordable, broad-based adoption we have seen.\nAnd as such, we will no longer provide quarterly coverage updates similar to the approach we took with Omnipod DASH. In practical terms, both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH are now fully covered.\nOur clinical initiatives continue to progress, including our type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this 3-month study will be the largest we have ever conducted, including up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes across 20 sites in the U.S. with a targeted focus on recruiting diverse and underserved populations. We began enrollment shortly after our last earnings call, and we're making great progress. We're excited to show what Omnipod 5 can do for people with type 2 diabetes.\nWe are also making great progress with our Omnipod 5 3-month randomized controlled trial. The last study participant in the U.S. is nearing completion. And in France, enrollment is nearing completion, and we expect the last participant to complete the study by the fall.\nWe believe this RCT study will be beneficial when negotiating access and premium pricing. Both our type 2 pivotal study and our RCT will be valuable additions to the already strong clinical body of evidence that we have been building for Omnipod 5 over the last several years.\nFueled by the success of Omnipod 5, our teams are already working on what's coming next. As I mentioned, we received clearance for Omnipod GO in the U.S., which should further build on our type 2 leadership position. We estimate the total addressable market for Omnipod GO is at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM.\nWe expect to begin a small pilot program this year in select locations and remain on track for a commercial launch in 2024. We have several competitive advantages in the type 2 space, including those that exist for us in the type 1 market such as our unique form factor and our U.S. pharmacy channel access.\nIn Q1, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. This percentage is lower than historical levels due to the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, which, like all AID systems, has an indication for only the type 1 market.\nOn an absolute basis, new customer starts in the type 2 space remains strong. Our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's Libre systems as well as our iOS integration efforts continues to progress very well.\nI want to take a moment to congratulate Abbott on their recent Libre 2 and Libre 3 iCGM clearance milestones. That is quite an accomplishment. Both of our CGM partners have made exciting progress, and we're thrilled to be advancing our development efforts with both for the benefit of our current and future customers. We believe we offer the best AID system on the market. And adding CGM [indiscernible] choice for our current as well as future customers will only strengthen that value proposition.\nMoving on to our international operations, where we are excited to introduce Omnipod 5 in the U.K. in the middle of this year and in Germany in the fall, and we are currently training HCPs in both markets. This marks the first time we're bringing a cloud-connected Omnipod device to international markets, delivering the benefits of near real-time data management to our customers and HCPs.\nOur launch of Omnipod 5 in these countries marked the beginning of our staged international rollout with a broader rollout across our international markets next year. Another one of our competitive moats is our global manufacturing capabilities, which are critical to our long-term growth plan and ability to fulfill our mission. While we continue to navigate some challenging macro-related headwinds, we are securing components and producing Pods ahead of forecasted demand levels, ensuring global supply for our expanding customer base.\nAdditionally, we are making great progress building our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which will further strengthen our global capabilities. We are on target with our build schedule and expect to take possession of the facility by the end of this year, placing us on track to begin manufacturing in 2024.\nEarlier this week, we published our 2022 Sustainability Report, noting exciting progress across a number of environmental, social and governance initiatives. As a result of all of our initiatives, we were named by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2023.\nThis past quarter, we also were pleased to be added to the S&P 500. This is a fantastic achievement for Insulet and speaks to the hard work and dedication of our entire global team as well as the success we are having growing the company and executing our mission.\nBefore I turn the call over to Wayde, I want to comment on the changes to our organizational structure we announced this afternoon. Our business is enjoying incredible momentum, and we are confident we can build on that.\nOmnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management, and we are just getting started. Omni 5 is a revolutionary offering, delivering the most convenient therapy experience with world-class clinical outcomes as our results clearly demonstrate. And Omnipod 5 is also novel because it gives us the opportunity to use cloud connectivity and data to constantly improve all aspects of the end-to-end customer experience.\nIn addition to that, we are now the market leaders in the type 2 space, and we have a huge opportunity to expand there with a portfolio of therapy options. And of course, we are early in our efforts to expand internationally.\nIn order to capture those opportunities and reach the millions of patients that need our help, we've decided to make some changes to how we operate. It has been almost a year since I assumed the CEO role, and I could not be more proud of how well our team continues to execute.\nOver that time, we've taken a close look at our organizational structure and working processes. And in order to both continue our momentum and capture the full [indiscernible] of opportunities we see for growth, we need to do 3 things: elevate and integrate our technology stack and especially our cloud and data analytics capabilities, invest in regional and local markets to drive growth and expansion and most importantly, get even closer to our customers and orient the entire organization around the end-to-end customer experience.\nTherefore, as we announced earlier today, we have created 2 new roles in the organization effective July 1. The first is Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer, responsible for product vision and execution, including franchise management, product management and driving the end-to-end customer experience across the enterprise. Eric Benjamin, our Executive Vice President of Innovation and Strategy, will take on this new role.\nThe second is Chief Technology Officer, responsible for software and hardware engineering, information technology, cybersecurity, digital and data services and system architecture. Mark Field, our Group Vice President of Software Engineering, will step into this new role. On behalf of the entire Insulet team, I'd like to congratulate Eric and Mark and thank each of them for their leadership.\nWe also announced that in order to more effectively drive growth in our international markets, we are transitioning from a structure that had a global Chief Commercial Officer role to one with 2 distinct commercial leaders, one for U.S. and another for international. As a result of that decision, Bret Christensen is leaving Insulet on May 5 to pursue other opportunities. He's agreed [indiscernible] consulting services during the transition period.\nWe want to thank Bret for everything he has accomplished during his time at Insulet. He played an important role in so many key milestones for us, including our move into the pharmacy channel and of course, the launch of Omnipod 5. We wish Bret all the best, and I know he wishes us all the best as he's here today with us on the call as well. Thank you, Bret.\nI'm confident that the refinements we are making to our organization structure will help us to not only continue our terrific momentum but also improve our efficiency, speed our time to market with new innovations and accelerate our growth in international markets. I look forward to continuing to work with our entire Insulet team to realize our company's immense potential and continue to drive our mission to simplify the lives of the millions of people around the world living with diabetes.\nIn closing, the first quarter marked a strong start to what we are confident will be another successful year for Insulet. Omnipod 5 is transforming the market and changing the way that people manage their diabetes.\nHCPs are adopting and championing Omnipod 5, helping to bring it to the thousands of people with diabetes who benefit from it. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry in innovation. It takes a company-wide effort of all of our employees to generate the growth we are consistently delivering while investing in our business to drive sustainable growth and value creation for years to come.\nI will now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim. First quarter results exceeded our expectations, and we made further strategic progress. We delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. And in the U.S., they were the second highest of all time, slightly below last quarter's record.\nWe generated 23% revenue growth in Q1, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by total global Omnipod growth of 35%. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 210 basis point headwind compared to Q1 of last year.\nU.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 49%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH Pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where we provide the personal diabetes manager for no charge.\nOmnipod 5 ramp dynamics, unlike prior quarters, resulted in a net headwind for the quarter of $2 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated 14 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers, in large part due to existing customer conversions [indiscernible] Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod, who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies.\nThis is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand for Omnipod 5 of approximately $8 million and another $8 million reduction associated with actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5.\nConsistent with Q4, our Q1 Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts, which we expect to be the case on an ongoing basis. This is especially important given our focus on moving increasing volume through the pharmacy channel, which was over 85% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter.\nInternational Omnipod revenue increased 10% in Q1, exceeding our guidance range driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 620 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was in line with our guidance.\nOur estimated global attrition increased slightly to approximately 10% in Q1. We estimate international attrition increased to over 10% as a result of continued AID competition, while U.S. attrition improved to under 10%. We estimate global utilization trends to remain consistent with seasonal trends.\nDrug Delivery revenue declined 98% within our guidance range. Gross margin was 67.2%, representing an approximate 380 basis point decrease, which included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 30 basis points.\nCost of revenue included income of $8 million due to a lower estimated cost associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 64.9%, representing a 610 basis point decrease, in line with our expectations.\nOur growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium, positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of cost due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower Drug Delivery revenue.\nOperating expenses were slightly above our expectations to support higher-than-expected revenue and were higher than Q1 of last year as we further invested in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 5.5% and 13.6%, respectively. Both exclude the favorable metal device correction adjustment of $8 million, and both were above our expectations due to a higher-than-anticipated revenue.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $620 million in cash and the full $100 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come.\nNow turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 21% to 25% and total company revenue growth to 18% to 22%.\nFor U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to 27% to 31% driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model.\nWe continue to expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022.\nFor International Omnipod, we are reaffirming expected revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we now estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 200 basis points. Growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution from Omnipod 5 in our international markets in 2023. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we continue to expect a decline of 55% to 45%, representing a $1 decline, similar to what we experienced in 2022.\nTurning to 2023 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts this year include the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, favorable geographical sales mix and manufacturing improvements. These drivers will be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation.\nAs we've said before, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect Q2 gross margin to be near the low end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing volume in the pharmacy channel and improving manufacturing performance.\nWe continue to expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the phased launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits, similar to 2022 levels.\nWe also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion and expect to begin to leverage investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022.\nTurning to our second quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 29% to 32% and total company growth of 27% to 30%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 37% to 40%. Our growth drivers remain the same: the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel; and our continued strong new customer starts; as well as the benefits of our annuity model.\nFor International Omnipod, we expect growth of 13% to 16% driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q1 Drug Delivery revenue decline of 25% to 20%.\nIn conclusion, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and operational performance. We achieved a number of milestones this past quarter and are incredibly excited about the year ahead and the opportunities we see to further our mission, improve our customers' lives and drive value for shareholders.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVP of IR, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q4, the global Insulet team delivered another record quarter of growth, which was a strong end cap to a remarkable 2022. We exceeded our expectations once again, achieving revenue growth of 45% in the U.S. and over 35% for total Omnipod, and our U.S. and global new customer starts were at record levels. And 2022 marked our seventh consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth.\nThis past year, we not only drove consistently strong financial performance, we also achieved a number of critical milestones. We now have roughly 360,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, including more than 100,000 customers on Omnipod 5. In fact, during Q4, Omnipod 5 represented over 90% of our U.S. new customer starts. This transformative technology is the leading offer in the market and is proving to be the obvious choice for consumers.\nThe 2022 full market release of our Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System was a huge achievement. This is the product our company was founded to make. And we continue to build on that momentum throughout the year, adding CE Mark approval and quickly extending our label in the U.S. to include pediatric customers down to age 2 for Omnipod 5 as well as completing the 510(k) submission for our type 2 basal-only Pod.\nDuring 2022, we also further strengthened our intellectual property moat, representing a culmination of work throughout the year that should protect our innovation capabilities and opportunities for years to come. And we made notable advancements in our clinical efforts, including the recent publication of our first look at real-world evidence for Omnipod 5. I'll speak in more detail about the highlights of these accomplishments in a few minutes.\nI could not be more proud of everything the Insulet team has achieved in advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. And on top of everything we've achieved during 2022, I am confident our best is yet to come.\nOmnipod 5 is truly unmatched as an AID system. With Omnipod 5, we have delivered a number of market firsts. It's the only tubeless, waterproof, Pod-based AID system and the first to offer full compatible smartphone control with constant cloud-based connectivity. This means doctors don't have to wait for data to be uploaded when or if a patient visits a physician.\nWith Omnipod 5, customers no longer need to plug in their devices to access their data. Our smart bolus calculator helps patients manage their blood glucose levels and trends, and there are no other AID systems that include the adaptive algorithm that Omnipod 5 has. It works right out of the box and learns each customer's specific usage and then predicts their trends and automatically personalizes their care. These all are competitive advantages that significantly improve and simplify diabetes management.\nOmnipod 5 continues to drive customer adoption from all market segments. MDI users are growing at the high end of our forecast as are those switching from competitive tubed pumps. And the number of current Omnipod customer conversions are exceeding our expectations.\nIn Q4, the percentage of customers coming from MDI and traditional tubed pumps was an estimated 65-35 split compared to our historical 80-20 mix due to significantly more competitive switches. This again speaks to the value Omnipod 5 brings to MDI and traditional tubed pump users. We also continue to win back thousands of customers who had once been Podders and returned to us in Q4 to adopt Omnipod 5. Adopters are coming from all age groups.\nDue to higher-than-expected demand for Omnipod 5, we increased investments in our support capabilities, primarily within our call centers. These investments have helped drive our customer and product support experience back to historical levels of excellence. This has included taking quick action to address certain complaints regarding the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 handheld devices.\nWe previously announced the medical device correction for Omnipod 5 due to an issue with the controller charging port and cable. The FDA subsequently classified this as a Class II correction, and we are in the process of providing replacements to our customers upon request.\nWith respect to the previously announced Omnipod DASH MDC, we expect to complete the replacement of Personal Diabetes Managers within the coming months. I am proud of our global team's focus to ensure these corrective actions were executed with a sense of urgency and care.\nConsumer-focused innovation is central to everything we do. Omnipod 5 was designed with the user 100% in mind, and the results and feedback we receive speak to our shared success. One recent story from a mother of an 8-year-old with diabetes was particularly touching. She said, \"Omnipod 5 has given me my life back. I sleep through the night. I feel like me again. Diabetes has moved from the foreground to the background in our daily lives.\" This speaks to the power of Omnipod 5 and supports why we designed the product and the customer experience the way we did.\nA critical element to our continued strong Omnipod growth is an unwavering commitment to expand access and awareness, and we're doing this through multiple initiatives. First is through our growing presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. With low co-pays and broad coverage, access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH is affordable and simpler, which helps drive adoption and makes Omnipod more attractive and accessible, especially during challenging economic times.\nSecond, we priced Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH, resulting in our ability to meaningfully expand commercial coverage for Omnipod 5. By year-end, coverage approached 90% of U.S. lives. Additionally, because the vast majority of our U.S. customers pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, the cost is similar to multiple daily injections, even though our technology offers improved outcomes, glycemic control and quality of life.\nOur annuity business model and pharmacy access also benefit physicians and payers. We have eliminated large upfront costs and lengthy lock-in periods. This offers real value to payers compared to traditional tubed pumps sold through the durable medical equipment channel. This is especially true when you consider that on average, individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years.\nI also want to share that we recently notified U.S. classic Omnipod customers about our plans to phase out that technology by the end of this year since the vast majority of our customer base no longer is on our legacy product. We value every classic Omnipod customer and will help them through their transition to either Omnipod 5 or Omnipod DASH.\n2022 also was another exciting year for Insulet in terms of advancing our clinical efforts, and that momentum is carrying into 2023. We recently finalized our type 2 pivotal study protocol with the FDA and received IDE approval. We plan to begin enrollment in the 3-month study in the coming weeks. This will be the largest clinical study we've conducted to date, enrolling up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes from 20 sites across the U.S. There will be a targeted focus to recruit diverse and underserved populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy of Omnipod 5.\nOmnipod 5 also opens up new avenues for clinical evidence. Yesterday, at ATTD, we shared the first release of real-world evidence for Omnipod 5 with data from more than 31,000 people using the system for at least 3 months. This kind of data is unmatched by competitors and gives us valuable insights into how people use the product and the outcomes they're achieving. We're able to see which device settings contribute to maximum time in range and minimal hypoglycemia. The data demonstrated glycemic results in line with those observed in our pivotal trials and also reinforced the benefits of our customizable target glucose settings. These are some of the reasons why Omnipod 5 will be a market leader for years to come.\nOur enthusiasm is shared by a health care practitioner who recently said, \"The Omnipod 5 real-world data set is striking in that it includes all users since everyone is connected to the cloud-based system. With this large sample and limited selection bias, we see strong time in target range and minimal time below range, exceeding glycemic targets on average. This is extremely promising for long-term benefit in the real world.\"\nOur real-world data for Omnipod 5 will be incredibly powerful over time since every user is cloud connected. For patients, this means we can continue to personalize and improve the overall experience. For physicians, this means we will be able to streamline their workflows. Over time, our intention is to tie that usage data to claims data to further drive Omnipod 5 adoption as well as build a host of other enhancements such as population-based health management for payers.\nNobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy. This means that we will have unprecedented insights into actual population level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and build on our already market-leading product differentiation.\nWhile we are thrilled with the market response to Omnipod 5, winning in the global diabetes market requires a commitment to innovation. Today, we have a strong innovation pipeline that includes our type 2 basal-only Pod, future AID offerings and digital and data capabilities.\nToday, our unique form factor and access model are helping us win in the type 2 population in addition to type 1. We deliver a market-leading experience, and as a result, in Q4, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our new U.S. customer starts.\nWe expect to build on our leading competitive position in this market as well as expand our total addressable market with the planned 2024 commercialization of our new basal-only Pod. This will be a unique product for the type 2 market and will provide us with early entry into the treatment experience and help patients become comfortable with the Omnipod on-body experience. We believe this innovation will offer users a clear pathway to adopt Omnipod 5 as their insulin needs progress. We estimate the total addressable market for our basal-only Pod is approximately 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM.\nWe are also making great headway in our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's Libre systems, and our iOS integration efforts continue to progress very well. We offer the best AID system on the market today, and our future generations of technology, including CGM of choice, will continue to strengthen our leading value proposition.\nTo continue to deliver our unique and leading technologies, a key priority for us is our intellectual property. We have significantly expanded our patent portfolio over the last few years, and in this past year, we more than doubled it both organically and through record patent filings and an acquisition.\nWe acquired the pump and AID patent portfolio of Bigfoot Biomedical, including approximately 400 patents and a large number of global patent applications. Over many years, Bigfoot has developed a strong patent library, covering areas such as closed-loop technology, smartphone control, secure communications and improved user experience innovations. Our acquisition of these patent assets add significant strength to our overall intellectual property portfolio.\nAdditionally, in the fourth quarter, we entered into a mutual agreement with Medtronic not to assert our patents at each other for certain diabetes technologies. With certain exclusions, this agreement applies to both companies' existing products as well as new products commercialized over the next 7 years and does not permit cloning each other's products. The agreement replaces an earlier one and provides more certainty around covered products and the agreement's duration. Through these efforts, we have created a broad and deep IP moat that positions us incredibly well to build upon our current leading innovative platform and continue to grow our expanding innovation pipeline.\nMoving on to our international operations. We had a solid year of double-digit revenue growth, even with the ongoing impact of AID competition. We expect to begin to offset those headwinds in 2023 with the launch of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. midyear and in Germany toward the end of this year, marking the beginning of our staged international rollout. We plan to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly internationally during 2024.\nLastly, our global manufacturing capabilities continue to support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. While macro conditions remain challenging, we continue to support our growing global customer base and the strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our operations team has worked tirelessly to secure components and build products ahead of our forecasted demand. We remain committed to providing uninterrupted supply and the highest quality product to all our global customers.\nIn closing, the fourth quarter marked a terrific end to a remarkable year of strong financial performance and operational achievements. We have so many exciting opportunities in the years ahead, and the entire Insulet team remains committed to executing our mission and strengthening our long-term growth trajectory.\nI will now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP,CFO & Treasurer, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim. 2022 was an exciting year with the U.S. launch of Omnipod 5, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We once again delivered strong financial results while advancing our mission.\nIn Q4, we generated 23% revenue growth, finishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 36%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 250 basis point headwind compared to Q4 of last year.\nU.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 45%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH Pods.\nGrowth in the quarter included an estimated $15 million net volume benefit associated with the Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was driven primarily by new Omnipod 5 customers, including conversions from Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod, where we again benefited from some customers simultaneously getting both their starter kits and first order of refills as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This benefit was partially offset by some Omnipod 5 customers skipping a refill as a result of this dynamic. This volume benefit primarily from conversions will create a tougher comparison in future years as we expect most existing customers to switch to Omnipod 5 in 2023.\nDuring Q4, Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts. This is an important milestone in our transition to pharmacy as all Omnipod 5 coverage is through the pharmacy channel and as the majority -- as is the majority of Omnipod DASH. As a result, our pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 80% of our total U.S. volume in the fourth quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 19% in Q4, above our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption.\nOn a reported basis, foreign currency was a 13-point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 3 points favorable versus our guide. As a reminder, our revenue in Q4 of the prior year was impacted by an unfavorable $5 million channel inventory reduction, creating an easier comparison.\nDuring Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remain consistent with prior years with higher utilization in Q4. Note, we estimated higher utilization in Q3 above historic trends with the volume benefit of the initial Omnipod 5 ramp. Historically, our U.S. utilization has been highest in the fourth quarter of the year.\nDrug Delivery revenue declined 90%, slightly better than our guidance range. Gross margin was 58.8%, representing an approximate 10-point decrease, including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 50 basis points.\nCost of revenue included a $21 million net charge or approximately 570 basis points associated with the voluntary medical device correction. This net charge was comprised of $27 million related to our previously announced Omnipod 5 MDC, partially offset by a $6 million benefit due to a revised estimated costs associated with the Omnipod DASH MDC. Excluding the Q4 MDC net charge, adjusted gross margin was 64.5%, representing a 480 basis point decrease, in line with our expectations.\nOur growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium, positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of costs due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower Drug Delivery revenue and a charge associated with the phaseout of classic Omnipod.\nOperating expenses were above our expectations to support continued higher sales performance and were higher than Q4 of last year as we further invest in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q4 were 11.5% and 19.3%, respectively. Both exclude the voluntary medical device correction net charge and a $2 million benefit related to a legal settlement adjustment. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses.\nTurning to full year results. We delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% and total company revenue growth of 22%, which reflect the incredible demand for Omnipod 5, ongoing contribution from Omnipod DASH throughout our global markets and the benefit of our annuity-based business model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was unfavorable over the prior year by 360 basis points.\nIn 2022, we achieved adjusted gross margin of 66.2%, down 220 basis points and in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, down 200 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.2%, down 240 basis points. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses and were slightly higher than our expectations due to our revenue outperformance.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with $675 million in cash. In addition, during Q4, we further strengthened our financial position by increasing our available borrowings under our credit agreement to $100 million. We remain in a solid position to continue investing in our business.\nNow turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22% and total company revenue growth of 14% to 19%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 21% to 26%, driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts and conversions from another Omnipod product as well as the continued adoption of Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model.\nWe currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be more weighted to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022.\nFor International Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. While we're excited to introduce Omnipod 5 to our first international markets later this year, given our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution to growth in our international markets for Omnipod 5 in 2023. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, in 2023, we expect a decline of 55% to 45%, representing a $1 decline similar to what we experienced in 2022.\nTurning to 2023 gross margin. We expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. We expect a favorable impact from the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel and favorable geographical sales mix. These tailwinds are expected to be more than offset by inflation, higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume.\nAs we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect gross margin in the first half of the year to be near the lower end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing sales volume, improving manufacturing performance, and timing of the additional costs associated with the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 medical device corrections.\nWe expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the phased launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We expect operating margin to be in the high single digits, similar to 2022 levels, with significant improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. For capital expenditures, we expect a lower level than 2022 as we begin to leverage our investments, building capacity to date.\nTurning to our first quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 22% to 25% and total company growth of 11% to 14%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 200 basis points.\nFor U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 33% to 36%. We expect the core drivers of growth to be the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our consistent record new customer starts as well as our annuity model.\nFor International Omnipod, we expect growth of 4% to 7%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds and estimated order timing. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 Drug Delivery revenue to be nominal based on the current production schedule.\nIn conclusion, we delivered a strong finish in the fourth quarter and another year of solid financial performance. We achieved many milestones and entered 2023 with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business. We're incredibly excited about the year ahead and what is to come for our customers and our shareholders as we further execute our global mission.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Welcome to Insulet's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVP of IR, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you, Duleum. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 third quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.\nThe third quarter marked a continuation of our strong revenue performance, new customer growth and strategic progress. We increased our full year revenue outlook, and the entire Insulet team continues to execute at a high level and advance our mission. We're focused on finishing the year strong and carrying sustained momentum into 2023.\nIn Q3, we achieved several notable milestones. We once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts which helped us achieve a remarkable 42% year-over-year growth in the U.S., our highest U.S. revenue growth rate in at least a decade. This was driven in large part by an incredible start for our U.S. full market release for our revolutionary Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system. The feedback on Omnipod 5 from our Podders and their caregivers continues to be fantastic.\nAnd of course, we are far from finished. We continue to work to expand access to Omnipod 5 as well as increase the total addressable market for our Omnipod platform. During the quarter, we expanded Omnipod 5's indication down to H2 and secured CE Mark. We also continue to drive growth with Omnipod DASH, both in our international markets and in the U.S., especially in the type 2 diabetes market.\nBuilding on that, we are incredibly excited to announce that we have developed and will soon submit a 510(k) for a new basal-only PODD to accelerate our future growth in type 2. It's a clear indication of our commitment to further innovate for people with diabetes and expand our addressable market, and I'll share more about this in a few moments.\nWe could not be more excited about what's yet to come for Insulet and our customers. The market enthusiasm for Omnipod 5 is greater than even we anticipated. Demand is coming from all across the market. Our core target market of MDI users is growing ahead of our own forecast and continues to be the greatest source of new customers for us. But we are also seeing significant increases in customer conversions. Current Omnipod users are converting to Omnipod 5 at a much higher rate than we saw with previous product launches, demonstrating that even current Podders see Omnipod 5 as a breakthrough offering. In addition to those coming from MDI, we are seeing significant volumes of customers converting from tubed pump technologies. And in many cases, we are winning back customers who had once been Podders.\nThousands of people are returning to us and adopting Omnipod 5. And this strong demand also comes from all age groups. We achieved record new customer starts with both adult and pediatric users.\nIn Q3, after only 2 months of its full market release, Omnipod 5 represented over 80% of U.S. new customer starts compared to over 25% in Q2. This validates the power of Omnipod 5 and the competitive advantages it offers. It is the only tubeless AID system with an adaptive algorithm that works as designed right out of the box, delivering high time and range. The algorithm then learns from each patient's specific usage and automatically personalizes care over the first 2 or 3 pods. Because of that personalization, we are seeing consistent reports of increased time and range, reduction in A1c and markedly low hypoglycemia. It is the combination of clinical effectiveness and our unique Omnipod platform that is fueling our success. As a result, our historical 80-20 mix of those coming from MDI and traditional tubed pumps is changing. In Q3, we saw an estimated 60-40 split due to significantly more competitive takeaways.\nWe're excited by our early progress and are gratified to see how Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management. We have long believed that superior innovation, offering simplicity, discretion and improved outcomes, will drive adoption in our large underpenetrated markets. Omnipod 5 is demonstrating this to be true.\nOmnipod 5 offers more than any other AID system on the market, including a number of market firsts. It's the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone-controlled AID system, the first system that no one has to plug in to access data and the first AID system with a predictive algorithm, our smart bolus calculator, that directly incorporates not just blood glucose levels, but also blood glucose trends.\nAnd the stories are inspiring. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who has patients on Omnipod 5, several of whom called her elated about the dramatic improvements in their diabetes management. This HCP said she and her patients are amazed with our system. And for the first time, they have been in range 100% of the time. They called their experience \"life changing\".\nIt's clear Omnipod 5 is making it easier for our customers and their caregivers to manage diabetes, and it's simplifying the interaction between patients and their HCPs. We expect Omnipod 5's contribution to further accelerate growth as we gain additional market traction and increased commercial coverage.\nTo that end, we've made significant strides with access. And by the end of Q3, we secured coverage for over 80% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod 5, well ahead of our initial expectations. We have also experienced a few challenges that we are hitting head on. The incredible market response has placed pressure on our onboarding capabilities, particularly incoming call volumes. Additionally, the voluntary medical device correction we initiated last month for our Omnipod DASH personal diabetes managers in response to the battery issue we identified also slightly elevated call volumes. Given this, we are in the process of carefully reviewing the early field data on the Omnipod 5 controller to ensure it meets our high expectations for safety and user satisfaction. We have received a few inbound calls highlighting a potential issue related to charging the controller. Our work is ongoing, and if we ultimately decide to take a particular action, you can expect it to be swift and transparent. Every single aspect of the Omnipod 5 experience is important to us. We are investing to increase our onboarding and call center resources, and are already seeing significantly improved response times.\nWe're driving customer growth through our access and awareness efforts. We have a differentiated business model and a unique leadership position in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Both make access to our technology extremely simple, efficient and affordable, which further differentiates Omnipod during challenging economic times.\nWe have long focused on improving functional access for our customers. As a result, the vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel for both Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5, and the average co-pay is less than $50. Consistent with our commitment to drive expanded access, we are proud to offer our technology at a similar cost to multiple daily injections, while also delivering improved outcomes and quality of life.\nWe also remain focused on the benefits our model provides to physicians and payers. Our pay-as-you-go model makes access easier and more affordable for customers while also eliminating lengthy lock-in periods. At the same time, it provides a superior value proposition and is less expensive for payers. We eliminate the large upfront costs that are common in the durable medical equipment channel with traditional tube pumps, which make those offerings far more expensive, especially since individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years on average.\nIn addition to growing our strong position in the type 1 market, our initiatives are also key drivers of our leadership in the type 2 space. People with type 2 diabetes are becoming increasingly comfortable with an on-body tubeless device, and we offer an unmatched user experience with Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod. We were pleased with the recent local coverage determination proposal that would provide CGM coverage for basal insulin patients. This proposal, if approved, increases access to CGMs.\nAt the same time, CGM awareness is rising, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this market expansion opportunity. Today, we're a leader in the type 2 space, and now we are taking this a step further with another novel innovation. We have developed a version of Omnipod specifically designed to treat type 2 patients on basal-only therapy, which we plan to submit to the FDA in a few days.\nIt should greatly improve both the user experience and adherence by completely removing the use of needles. It is the perfect product for people with needle phobia and others who may struggle with adherence to daily or weekly injections.\nThe total addressable market for our basal-only pod is estimated to be approximately 3 million people in the U.S. alone. It leverages our unique Omnipod platform, including auto insertion, comfortable wear and affordable access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, creating a winning first-of-its-kind product for this population. The basal-only pod is incredibly simple to use and requires no controller or phone application to deliver a fixed rate of rapid-acting insulin for 72 continuous hours. This new innovation allows early entry into the type 2 treatment pathway, gets patients comfortable with Pod Therapy, and creates a clear pathway for them to adopt other Omnipod product offerings as their insulin needs evolve.\nPending regulatory clearance, we plan to begin U.S. commercialization in 2024. Our basal-only pod is expected to drive TAM expansion and revenue growth for years to come while further improving the lives of people with diabetes. This innovation builds upon our leadership position in the type 2 market. During the third quarter, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts. As expected, this percentage is declining given our success driving Omnipod 5 adoption in the type 1 market. However, we remain confident that the simplicity of our Omnipod 5 platform represents a significant competitive advantage that will allow us to expand our customer base in both the type 1 and type 2 populations.\nAs a reminder, like all AID systems, Omnipod 5 is currently indicated for use only for people with type 1 diabetes. However, the number of individuals with type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH remains very strong. Serving the type 2 population is a priority for us, and we are confident the combination of our form factor, access model and innovative product portfolio will continue to drive customer adoption.\nAnother area of focus is advancing our clinical efforts. Our Omnipod 5 randomized controlled trial is progressing well. We're on track to complete enrollment of 120 participants in the U.S. and expect to soon begin enrollment of up to 80 participants in France. We believe the results will demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefits compared to non-AID pump use with CGM. We are confident this will strengthen our position to secure broad reimbursement and pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets.\nAs I mentioned, we were excited to receive our expanded indication down to age 2 for Omnipod 5. We are a leader in the pediatric segment and are confident Omnipod 5 will truly change the lives of these young children and their families. Based on our positive Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study results, I'm happy to share that we expect to begin a type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 in 2023.\nWe continue to advance our robust innovation pipeline with a focus on future AID offerings as well as building our digital and data capabilities. Our iOS integration work is ongoing as is our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's CGMs. We remain committed to building on our product offering and also providing CGM of choice to our customers.\nOur investments in R&D and innovation are a strategic priority that we fully expect will drive sustainable long-term growth and continued value creation. Our priorities in this area are clear: complete integration with our CGM partners, grow our global addressable markets, and create digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers.\nOne especially important feature Omnipod 5 offers is real-time usage data feeds. This simplifies diabetes management for patients and their physicians. Looking ahead, we will be in a strong position to use that data to further enhance the patient experience, improve workflows for physicians and build on our competitive advantages.\nMoving to our international operations. We were pleased to receive CE Mark for Omnipod 5 in September. This represents a major step in our path to deliver Omnipod 5 to people globally. We remain focused on building the necessary cloud-based infrastructure needed to deliver the Omnipod 5 experience while ensuring compliance with local data protection regulations. At the same time, we're developing country-specific launch plans and continuing our work to drive premium reimbursement. We expect to enter our first international market in mid-2023. Given our planned stage approach, we will roll out Omnipod 5 more broadly throughout 2024.\nLastly, our global manufacturing capabilities support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. Global supply chain and macro-related headwinds remain, but we are addressing the needs of our expanding global customer base and supporting the adoption ramp of Omnipod 5. Our team has secured components and built product ahead of our forecasted capacity needs. While this results in increased cost that impact margins, they are necessary to deliver uninterrupted products for our customers.\nAlthough our U.S. manufacturing will continue to be a headwind to gross margin given the higher production costs, over the long term, we are confident all of our sites combined will continue to deliver the highest quality product and gross margin expansion. Our U.S. manufacturing has allowed us to build redundancy, capabilities and gain key learnings that are driving efficiency, quality and productivity improvements across all our facilities.\nIn closing, we once again achieved notable financial, commercial and operational milestones and are focused on finishing the year strong. With our customers at the center of everything we do, our entire Insulet team is executing our global mission and strengthening our foundation for sustainable long-term growth.\nI will now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP,CFO & Treasurer, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim.\nQ3 marked another record-breaking quarter. Our global team continues to execute at a high level. And Omnipod 5 is proving to be a life-changing new option for people with diabetes. We're focused on finishing the year strong and entering 2023 with momentum. We generated 29% revenue growth in the third quarter, finishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 30%.\nOn a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 480 basis point headwind compared to Q3 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 42%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. This includes a growing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the pod given we provide the PDM at no charge in the pharmacy channel.\nGrowth in the quarter included an estimated $16 million benefit associated with the initial quarter of Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was primarily driven by conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we benefited from some customers getting both their starter kits and first refills in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies.\nOmnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were over 95% of our total U.S. new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod 5 at over 80% and Omnipod DASH at almost 15%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to almost 75% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9%, within our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by ongoing AID competition.\nOn a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,440 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 140 basis points unfavorable versus our prior guide. During Q3, our estimated global attrition remained consistent, and utilization was higher, driven by the Omnipod 5 ramp benefit mentioned.\nDrug Delivery revenue declined 4% at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 55.3%, representing an approximate 1,300 basis point decrease including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 70 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $37 million charge or approximately 1,100 basis points related to the voluntary medical device correction. The aggregate $37 million charge in Q3 primarily reflects the estimated replacement units, shipping and reclaim costs of the PDMs for global Omnipod DASH users.\nThis charge is within the estimated $35 million to $45 million we included in our October 8-K filing. We no longer expect any material additional operating expenses to be recorded in Q4 of this year or in 2023, as we previously had estimated.\nExcluding the Q3 medical device correction charge, adjusted gross margin was 66.1%, representing a 240 basis point decrease. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations, higher manufacturing costs associated with Drug Delivery and higher mix of costs given Omnipod 5 ramping. These costs were partially offset by growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium.\nOperating expenses were slightly higher than our expectations to support higher demand for Omnipod 5, and were higher than Q3 of last year due to continued investments in sales in and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, development work to advance our innovation pipeline, and costs to scale our business to support our growth.\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q3, which exclude the voluntary medical device correction, were 11.6% and 18.4%, respectively. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $720 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come.\nNow turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising our total company full year revenue growth to a range of 18% to 19%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 24%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 30% to 31%. We expect revenue growth to be driven primarily by strong Omnipod 5 new customer starts and conversions to Omnipod 5 from both Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod as well as increasing Omnipod DASH volume and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model.\nFor international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance and now expect a range of 11% to 12%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,200 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption partially offset by AID competitive headwinds.\nLastly, for Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance range and now expect a decline of 37% to 35%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic.\nTurning to 2022 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%. On a year-over-year basis, we expect our gross margin will be impacted by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to ramping Omnipod 5. And lower drug delivery revenue. These headwinds will be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel.\nAs we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results for the next couple of years. And as a result, we expect 2023 gross margin to be similar to this year. Excluding certain legal and CEO transition costs, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year due to the investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5 as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions.\nWe continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits. And for 2023, given the expectation for gross margin and the continued investments to launch Omnipod 5 in the U.S. and international markets as well as ongoing innovation, clinical, commercial and support functions to scale the business and costs associated with our implementing a new enterprise reporting system, we expect operating margins to be similar to 2022. Our commitment to margin expansion continues, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. Lastly, we now expect capital expenditures to be relatively level with prior year versus our previous expectation of a slight increase.\nTurning to our fourth quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 11% to 14%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 26%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 500 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 15% to 18%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 drug delivery revenue to be nominal as the majority of our orders for the year have already been fulfilled.\nIn conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance, achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. These are exciting times, given the full market release of Omnipod 5, the recent milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made advancing our innovation pipeline. We're focused on continuing to execute at a high level and delivering on our mission.\nWith that, Duleum, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVP of IR, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you, Dilham. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 second quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange.\nThese measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as CEO of Insulet. This past quarter, we exceeded our revenue expectations resulting from sustained momentum across our business. We are halfway through the year, and the entire Insulet team is executing at a high level. We increased our full year outlook for U.S. Omnipod, delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts, had our second highest new customer starts quarter internationally and meaningfully advanced each of our strategic imperatives. Accomplishing this was no easy task given the challenging global macro environment that we and other companies are facing.\nWe are incredibly excited to have recently entered full market release for Omnipod 5. And now our differentiated transformative technology is available broadly through retail pharmacies. The results to date have been amazing. Omnipod 5 is proving to be the game changer we thought it would be. Customer and health care provider feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and our teams are doing a remarkable job executing the launch.\nOur CE Mark submission review is progressing very well, and we are in the final stretch toward approval. This represents a key milestone in our plan to bring Omnipod 5 to people with diabetes around the world. This approval is one step in our strategy to participate in the international AID market, which is being driven largely by CGM reimbursement.\nWe have also advanced our clinical efforts. Our FDA submission for an expanded indication for Omnipod 5 in the U.S. down to age 2 is progressing very well, and we are confident in the near-term clearance. The value that Omnipod 5 can deliver to young children and their families is abundantly clear, and we're thrilled to soon bring Omnipod 5 to this highly vulnerable population.\nWe shared compelling data at ADA, demonstrating how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for the type 2 insulin requirement population, a market segment that is further adopting Omnipod due to our unique value proposition. And in the type 1 population, we are currently enrolling for a 200-patient 3-month randomized controlled trial in France and the U.S. to demonstrate superior efficacy for Omnipod 5 compared to non-AID pumps and CGM alone.\nLastly, we broke ground at our future Malaysian manufacturing facility, which will strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities and redundancy as well as support our international expansion strategy.\nBefore moving into a broader view of the quarter on our progress, I want to take a step back and reflect on my first 2 months as CEO. I was aware of the strength and commitment of the entire Insulet team from my 3 years on the Board of Directors. Now that I'm CEO, I'm even more impressed. Our global teams are exceptional. The shared commitment to our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes is inspiring and is pervasive throughout our organization.\nDiabetes is a growing global epidemic, and Insulet's ability to serve unmet needs and provide improved outcomes has never been more important. It is clear that we have the team, the product portfolio, the innovation road map and most importantly, the passion to improve millions of lives, and I'm excited and privileged to lead Insulet on that journey.\nExpanding access and awareness are keys to driving our business forward. Despite improvements over the last few years, only a small percentage of people with type 1 diabetes globally benefit from insulin delivery technology. Access and awareness are important levers that will significantly drive increased penetration over the coming years. We are making terrific progress building awareness and securing coverage globally, including broad coverage for Omnipod 5 in the U.S.\nWe've built a unique leadership position in the U.S. pharmacy channel, which improves functional access for both the type 1 and type 2 populations. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 each month through the pharmacy for Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5, with many paying nothing. We've eliminated lengthy lock-in periods and upfront costs that are common in the DME channel, and our pay-as-you-go model provides easier and more affordable access for our customers and removes risk for payers.\nAnd we are delivering this easier access, combined with lower costs while also delivering an improved customer experience and better outcomes. That's a winning combination and one that resonates with people using multiple daily injections, a population from which we continue to capture approximately 80% of our new customers.\nOur pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business models also connect with people with type 2 diabetes. We are acutely focused on making access simple and more affordable, providing an unmatched form factor and generating clinical evidence that supports what Omnipod can do for the type 2 population.\nBecause the Omnipod offering is so compelling, during the second quarter, type 2 users represented almost 30% of our U.S. new customer starts. As expected, this is a percentage reduction from prior quarters because Omnipod 5 is indicated for use with people with type 1 diabetes as is the case with all AID systems. Therefore, we expect the mix percentage of new customers to change as more people with Type 1 adopt Omnipod 5. We saw this begin in Q2 and we're excited to see it continue now that we are in full market release. Nevertheless, we continue to see a strong number of new customers with Type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH, and we remain confident in our ability to further penetrate this underserved population.\nA major component of our awareness efforts is our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign. We ramped our DTC program ahead of the full market release of Omnipod 5 and have since accelerated our spend. This has resulted in more people wanting to learn about Omnipod 5 and the impact it can have on their lives and those they care about. We expect our DTC efforts for Omnipod 5 will be even more effective than what we have experienced for Omnipod DASH. We are also using DTC to drive awareness for Omnipod in select international markets.\nCustomers love Omnipod 5. That's because of the number of firsts it brings to the market. It's the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone-controlled AID system, the first system no one has to plug in to access data and the first with a smart bolus calculator to directly incorporate trends. We've heard humbling and inspiring stories from countless customers and we're just getting started.\nI want to share a couple of stories we've heard from individuals adopting Omnipod 5 and how impactful it's been for their lives. An individual who had been using an insulin pump for over a decade and recently switched to Omnipod 5 told us that after 10 years of worrying about visible tubes, getting caught on door knobs and dealing with the nuisances of being tethered to his pump. He now spends more time focusing on life. His outcomes have improved, including his overnight blood sugar, and he no longer has to live his life with diabetes top of mind.\nWe also heard from a physician who has lived with type 1 diabetes for 43 years. He noted that during that time, he's seen treatment options evolve and change, but Omnipod 5 is the largest leap in improvement he has ever seen. This very experienced physician called our system \"remarkable.\"\nThese 2 stories are just a small representation of the amazing testimonials we continue to receive from Omnipod 5 users. There's a common thread that connects all the stories we hear from users. Omnipod 5 is redefining how people manage their disease and it's making their lives simpler. The impact Omnipod 5 is having is clear and it's powerful.\nIn Q2, the first full quarter of limited market release, Omnipod 5 already represented over 25% of our U.S. new customer starts. We expect that percentage to accelerate with the U.S. full market release as we now sell through a broader distribution channel, including all of our wholesalers that supply products to approximately 88,000 retail pharmacies.\nWe are also having outstanding success securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Today, we have over 55% covered lives for Omnipod 5, which is well ahead of where we were when launching Omnipod DASH and represents a significant increase from Q1. Our team has done an amazing job, and we expect to make meaningful progress the rest of this year and into the next.\nOmnipod 5 is now fully available through retail, specialty and mail order pharmacies to anyone with a prescription and coverage, in line with our expected timing. Our limited market release provided key learnings about how health care professionals and customers interact with our product on board and virtually trained, all of which are dramatically easier than ever before. Already, the small improvements we have implemented are resonating with users, especially those coming from a tubed pump to transition to a more simplified experience.\nIn fact, one of the key learnings is that physicians and patients can rely on the automation of the system to do the work for them during the first few days. Omnipod 5 works with the first pod out of the box and then it learns and adapts to personalized care for each individual user, typically within the first or second pod change. This ability to automatically personalize therapy clearly differentiates Omnipod 5 from all other systems on the market. Quite simply, Omnipod 5 eliminates significant burden and shared work between patients and their physicians. Although our target market continues to be MDI, not surprisingly, many of our Omnipod 5 new customers come from competitive pumps and people are loving the experience.\nThe clinical benefits from Omnipod 5 were clearly demonstrated by the preschool pivotal extension data we shared at ADA that built on the strong results we saw during the study's initial phase, which were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Diabetes Care.\nDuring the first 3-month phase of the study as well as through the end of the extension phase, patients achieved an average A1c of 6.9% compared to 7.4% at baseline. The data clearly demonstrated these individuals maintained their improved levels through the extension phase. Time and range and percent time in hypoglycemia also showed sustained improvements during the extension phase, demonstrating the durability and power of Omnipod 5 for this critical population. We look forward to receiving our preschool indication for Omnipod 5 this year.\nThe engagement around Omnipod 5 at ADA was really something to see. We met with hundreds of attendees at our booth and held a product theater that was standing room only. It was here where we shared patient case studies and the real-world experience of HCPs who have had remarkable success with Omnipod 5.\nThe overwhelming feedback was that Omnipod 5 clearly stood out as the most robust AID offering. And many of the MDI and tubed pump users in attendance have since adopted our technology. Overall, ADA marked another opportunity to highlight our products and clinical accomplishments that demonstrate how Omnipod can change the lives of people with diabetes around the globe and how important and meaningful our mission is.\nWe are also advancing our innovation pipeline. We're developing the next generations of Omnipod 5, furthering our IOS development and working closely with our CGM partners, Dexcom and Abbott. Our innovation priorities are focused on growing our addressable market, building our next-generation AID technology and creating digital and data-driven products to make diabetes management easier for our customers and their physicians.\nMoving on to our international operations. Our Omnipod 5 CE Mark submission is moving swiftly through review, and we expect approval over the next couple of months. This is an important milestone for our international business as we work to bring Omnipod 5 to people around the world. CE Mark clears the way for us to focus on completing a cloud-based infrastructure that is compatible with local data protection regulations, developing country-specific launch plans, channel and customer experience approaches and seeking reimbursement.\nOmnipod 5 is a transformative platform, and we look forward to entering our first international markets in mid-2023. We will take a staged approach to entering markets so we can ensure successful launches in each country in which we operate.\nIn addition to bringing Omnipod 5 to global markets, we continue working to enter new markets and recently launched Omnipod DASH in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Omnipod is now available in 24 countries, and we're building local teams and advancing our regulatory and reimbursement goals. These efforts will serve us well as we bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and strengthen our competitive position.\nLastly, the global supply chain and inflation each presents significant challenges to Insulet as they do for most manufacturers across a range of industries. However, we continue to navigate these headwinds and increase our resiliency, ensuring ample product supply, including supporting the Omnipod 5 launch and the needs of our growing global customer base. We are mitigating supply risks by securing components well ahead of our capacity needs. While this comes at an increased cost that will have a near-term impact on margins, we are taking the appropriate steps in these turbulent times to ensure uninterrupted supply for our current and future customers.\nThe footprint of our global manufacturing operations is one of our many competitive advantages, and we advanced our efforts to further strengthen our capabilities. We recently broke ground at a new manufacturing location in Malaysia. The future facility located in Johor Bahru represents an investment of approximately $200 million over the next 5 years, will provide approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and house more than 500 full-time employees at capacity.\nOur regional sourcing strategy includes the use of local suppliers for components, and we have already outlined our plans to utilize environmentally responsible and resource-efficient materials in our building design. We expect to begin production at this new facility by the end of 2024. This facility supports our operational strategy to increase our global manufacturing redundancy, build our global talent base and support future international market expansion efforts.\nIn closing, the second quarter marked a number of financial, commercial and operational milestones. Our entire Insulet team continues to execute with an unwavering commitment to our mission and to our customers. We are proud of all the work and accomplishments we achieved this quarter and know we are setting the stage for sustainable long-term growth.\nI'll now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP,CFO & Treasurer, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim. We've made great progress in Q2 as we delivered another quarter of record U.S. and global new customer starts and achieved a number of notable milestones, including the U.S. full commercial launch of Omnipod 5 within the time range we expected. We are advancing each of our strategic imperatives, navigating supply chain and inflation challenges and maintaining our focus on fulfilling our mission. We generated 18% revenue growth in the second quarter, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 390 basis point headwind compared to Q2 of last year.\nU.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 31%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel, including initial contributions from Omnipod 5. Q2 revenue included an estimated $7 million of net channel inventory build, which consisted of Omnipod 5 inventory build, partially offset by a reduction of classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH inventory at our distributors.\nAdditionally, as a reminder, Q2 of the prior year included a favorable comparison for an approximate $2 million catch-up in rebates from earlier periods. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were up sequentially to over 90% of our total U.S. new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod DASH at approximately 65% and Omnipod 5, over 25%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 65% of our total U.S. volume.\nInternational Omnipod revenue increased 9% at the low end of our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition headwinds and the pandemics compounding impact over the past year. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,130 basis point headwind over prior year.\nDuring Q2, both our estimated global attrition and pod utilization remain consistent. Drug Delivery revenue declined 36%, in line with our guidance range. Gross margin was 63.6%, representing a 580 basis point decrease or 640 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations, a higher warranty accrual for costs related to Omnipod DASH PDMs for battery lives as they age as well as higher costs given the mix impact of Omnipod 5 ramping, all partially offset by growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel.\nAs a reminder, the higher mix of volume at our U.S. manufacturing facility, growing Omnipod 5 volume and the higher component costs included in our inventory balance will continue to pressure gross margin for the remainder of this year as we sell the product out of inventory.\nOperating expenses were above our expectations due to $27.3 million of legal costs as well as $3.4 million of costs associated with the retirement and advisory services of the former CEO. Excluding these charges, operating expenses were higher than Q2 of last year, due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, international expansion, continued investments in innovation and scaling our global business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q2, which exclude the legal and CEO transition costs, were 1.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Both were impacted by the gross margin pressures and increase in operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. During the quarter, we secured an additional $10 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Overall, our financial position is strong and provides flexibility to invest across our business to fuel sustainable long-term growth.\nNow turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising full year revenue to a range of 14% to 17%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 23% to 26%. Revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased Omnipod DASH volume through the pharmacy channel, the benefit of our pay-as-you-go model, which should expand both our type 1 and type 2 customer base, and increasing volume for Omnipod 5 following our full market release.\nAs a reminder, significant revenue from the Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are reducing our full year revenue guidance to 9% to 12% related to the impact of AID competition in our international markets.\nRevenue growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, which is sold in all of our markets. We expect international revenue growth will be the highest in the fourth quarter of the year due to an easier comparison as well as an expected improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, for our drug delivery revenue range, we are lowering full year guidance to a decline of 35% to 40%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic.\nTurning to 2022 gross margin. We now expect a range of 65% to 66% and representing a decline of 200 basis points from our previous expectation as we continue to encounter higher costs associated with ramping U.S. manufacturing and Omnipod 5 volumes, higher warranty costs, and the ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures in the broader macro environment.\nWe continue to execute strategies to partially offset these headwinds while also ensuring we have more than enough capacity to meet expected demand. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin will be impacted by product line mix from lower drug delivery revenue, higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5, manufacturing components due to inflation and warranty costs. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel.\nWe expect unfavorable product mix, the U.S. manufacturing ramp as well as inflation and supply chain macro-related headwinds to continue to impact our results for the next couple of years. We expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year, driven by ongoing investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5, an increasing DTC advertising as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions.\nExcluding the legal and CEO transition costs, we now expect operating margin to be in the high single digits as a result of the gross margin reduction and the macro environment creating inflationary and foreign exchange pressures. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase slightly due to ongoing investments in key areas of our business.\nTurning to our third quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 17% to 20%, including Omnipod growth of 18% to 21%. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we estimate the impact will be approximately 500 basis points on a reported basis for total revenue. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 24% to 27%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model, growing Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and ramping contributions from Omnipod 5.\nWe expect Q3 international Omnipod growth of 7% to 10% driven by the ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by competitive AID headwinds and the compounding impact on new customer starts in 2021 and into 2022, largely due to the pandemic. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,300 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to decline 14% to 5% as revenue is normalizing to prepandemic levels.\nIn conclusion, we've achieved a number of critical milestones that further position Insulet for growth. While there continues to be macro-related challenges, these are exciting times with the full market release of Omnipod 5 now fully available through retail pharmacies, and soon CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 internationally. We're on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer growth while also investing in key areas throughout our global business, in order to drive future growth and sustain long-term value creation.\nWith that, Dilham, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVP of IR, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you, Dalam. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\nWith me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Hollingshead, member of Insulet's Board of Directors and Insulet's future President and CEO. Shacey and Wayde, along with Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, will be available for the Q&A portion of our call.

Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nBefore we turn to our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about this afternoon's announcement that for personal reasons, I will be stepping down from my executive positions at Insulet. After careful consideration over some time, I have made the very difficult decision to reduce my professional obligations in light of medical issues and other circumstances that have been impacting my family and those I care deeply about.\nEffective June 1, Jim Hollingshead, a member of our Board of Directors since 2019, will succeed me as President and CEO. I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished in my time as CEO. We have made significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes while enhancing Insulet's ability to innovate and operate with excellence.\nInsulet is well positioned for the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5 and poised for continued growth and impact for shareholders and the diabetes community. I remain profoundly committed to Insulet and the company's long-term success, and I look forward to continuing to serve as a director on Insulet's Board and as an adviser to Jim and the team. I will be working hand-in-hand with Jim to ensure a seamless transition of leadership responsibilities.\nIn recent years, we have made great progress improving the lives of people with diabetes by delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing the company's global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Hundreds of thousands of Podders around the world are leading happier and healthier lives because of our work and dedication.\nAnd with Omnipod 5, we will offer significantly improved outcomes and incredibly simplified diabetes management to millions of people across the globe. I have never been more excited or confident about Insulet's future. Insulet has a deep, talented team and is firing on all cylinders and poised for incredible growth.\nI know Jim well from our service on the Insulet Board together, and I'm delighted that he is the one to step into the role of CEO at this important time. The company will be in great hands under his leadership. He knows our company, our culture and our team and the strong relationships he has fostered with our management team will immediately serve the company well and ensure a smooth transition. His significant experience at the rapidly evolving crossroads of medical technology and digital solutions will also be incredibly valuable to the company.\nJim has joined us today, and I'd like to turn the call over to him for a few remarks.\n\nJames R. Hollingshead\n\nIndependent Director, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you, Shacey.\nShacey and I have built a terrific working relationship, and I'm very pleased that she will continue to serve on Insulet's Board and in addition, serve in an advisory role with the company. Shacey's continued active involvement and oversight will be incredibly valuable. This gives me great confidence that we won't miss a beat.\nUnder Shacey's remarkable leadership, Insulet has delivered tremendous growth. The company has pioneered innovations that deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes, and I will work hard to build on that legacy.\nOn a personal note, I'm excited to spend a lot more time in our company's headquarters. I plan to get a place here and also maintain my residence in Southern California, near Insulet's operations in San Diego and Tijuana. I am also looking forward to getting out on the road over the next several months to meet with Insulet's amazing employees as well as the company's business partners, analysts, investors and other stakeholders.\nIn closing, I am honored to assume the role of President and CEO of Insulet at this important time, and I'm energized by working alongside our excellent leadership team and talented employees to continue advancing our mission and strategic imperatives. We are well positioned to build on Insulet's momentum to drive significant value for shareholders and to continue to execute our mission.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Shacey for commentary on the quarter.\n\nShacey Petrovic\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim.\nWe are off to a great start in 2022 with financial results that finished ahead of expectations as our team continues to execute and build on the momentum in our business. We, once again, had record Q1 U.S. and global new customer starts in the first quarter, building on our success throughout 2021. We have meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives and are on track for another successful year.\nOur position in the underserved global diabetes market has never been stronger. We are especially excited about the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received during our limited market release from users of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system with full compatible smartphone control. The feedback has been nothing short of spectacular. Users love the system and have shared how it greatly simplifies their diabetes management and is truly changing their lives. HCP feedback has been equally strong. Our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are well underway, including our CE mark submission under active review, and we continue to expand our global presence.\nWe also recently shared compelling data from our type 2 feasibility study at the ATTD diabetes conference, which demonstrates the value Omnipod 5 can bring to the type 2 community. Omnipod offers an unmatched option for people living with type 2 diabetes given our pay-as-you-go model, pharmacy access, attractive form factor, growing clinical evidence and unparalleled simplicity.\nIn the first quarter, type 2 users represented approximately 35% of our U.S. new customer starts. Our competitive advantages and exciting innovation pipelines in both the type 1 and type 2 market segments position us to drive long-term revenue growth, increase our market share and total addressable market and expand our margins.\nAlso, last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report to provide all of our stakeholders a view into Insulet's approach to environmental, social and governance programs and the exciting progress we've made across a number of fronts. Just a few examples. In 2021, we reached 60% gender diversity on Insulet's Board, millions of used pods were diverted from landfills globally through product take-back programs and solar panels at our Massachusetts headquarters generated almost 800,000 kilowatt hours of renewable energy. Insulet is committed to the 3 pillars of our sustainability strategy: resilient operations, sustainable product innovation and people and communities. And it is encouraging to see us continue to mature across each of these areas.\nNow turning to an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Today, we are working to expand access to an awareness of Omnipod given the global diabetes market is underpenetrated and growing. We continue to drive increased adoption through the U.S. pharmacy channel, which makes access to Omnipod easier and more affordable by eliminating lengthy lock-in periods and heavy upfront costs. Our pay-as-you-go model removes risk for payers while also providing a superior and affordable experience for our customers.\nThe cost of Omnipod is consistent with multiple daily injections despite Omnipod's form factor, ease of use and improved outcomes. As a result, we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. Nearly all of our global new customers start on Omnipod DASH. And in the U.S. do so primarily through the pharmacy channel. Once we move into full market release this year, we can't wait to offer Omnipod 5 solely through the pharmacy.\nWe also continue to drive increased awareness of Omnipod through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign as well as our 30-day free trial. Our DTC investment in the U.S. is ramping in support of Omnipod 5. In addition, we continue to invest in DTC in select international markets, which is helping to drive new customer starts and increase awareness of Omnipod. Brand recognition is strong internationally, and these efforts will further raise awareness for Omnipod DASH in advance of our international launch of Omnipod 5.\nOur Omnipod 5 U.S. limited market release continues to progress as planned. In March, we made the smartphone app available. And we continue to roll out availability on a growing list of Android phone models, including those most widely used in the U.S. The feedback on full smartphone control has been remarkable and highlights how differentiated an experience Omnipod 5 offers.\nConsistent with what we've heard to date, I will share feedback from one user who has tried multiple forms of insulin delivery for 35 years, including tubed pumps. He said, he has never been in better control. His fears of lows are almost gone. Having diabetes is no longer at the forefront of his thinking and he has confidence in the algorithm to quickly get him to his customized target. He said, he knew Omnipod 5 was going to be good, but he didn't anticipate just how good.\nAll of this feedback validates the years of hard work our teams have put into the development of Omnipod 5 to deliver the best customer experience. With this launch, we have also created a customer service platform centered on simplifying the Omnipod 5 onboarding process and scaling our ability to train users. As an example, today, if you are a current Omnipod and Dexcom user, you have the ability to adopt Omnipod 5 through a 100% digital pathway without having to meet with a clinician or be trained by a field rep. This makes Omnipod easier to access for our customers.\nWhile we continue to test the Omnipod 5 customer journeys, our market access team is successfully securing expanded coverage. We are well on our way to achieving our internal target by full market release. After successful completion of the first phase of our limited market release, we recently expanded the availability of Omnipod 5 through a limited distribution network as planned. Now any doctor can write a prescription for Omnipod 5 and a growing number of people will have access to it. We know Omnipod 5 is going to be a game changer for people with diabetes, and we can't wait to bring it to the broader community.\nOur Omnipod 5 submission for an expanded indication down to age 2 is under active review with the FDA and progressing well, and we continue to plan for updated labeling this year. We also recently shared compelling data from the initial 8-week phase of our type 2 feasibility study. This was the first prospective AID study of people with type 2 diabetes conducted in the U.S. and included participants with an average age of 61 years who used Omnipod 5 at home.\nOnly one individual had experience with an insulin pump and approximately half had never used a CGM. The study results were impressive. The data demonstrated an overall A1c reduction of 1.3%, along with an additional 4.6 hours a day in normal glycemic range. Participants who were previously on MDI experienced reduced time in hypoglycemia and a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. We believe the benefits that users experience during our study are indicative of how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for people with type 2 diabetes, and we remain committed to continuing to innovate to meet the needs of this important group.\nWe also continue to advance our robust product pipeline, including next generations of our Omnipod 5 platform. This includes our iOS development, which is progressing very well, as is our integration work with Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. While Omnipod 5 is a priority today, we know competing and winning in the underserved global diabetes market requires a firm commitment to innovation. We have a compelling pipeline that includes next-generation AID technology, robust, data-driven and digital innovations and additional technological advancements designed to expand our total addressable markets.\nLastly, we continue to build on our strong patent portfolio. We had a record-setting number of patent filings in 2021 and expect to set another record this year. Our current technology as well as our exciting innovation pipeline are well protected and should further strengthen our global leadership in diabetes technology.\nDiabetes is a growing epidemic with millions of people diagnosed each year, and Omnipod is already making a difference in 23 countries. We are focused on further penetrating our existing markets, expanding our total addressable market by growing our presence in new regions and launching Omnipod 5 internationally.\nOur CE mark submission is progressing well, and we are making terrific progress preparing for an Omnipod 5 international launch. We are further building our teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. AID and CGM awareness and adoption are increasing globally, helping to unlock reimbursement and access pathways. As a result, we will be well positioned to leapfrog the competition and have Omnipod 5 become the preferred AID system in our global markets.\nIn terms of market expansion, last month, we launched Omnipod DASH in Saudi Arabia and expect to enter the United Arab Emirates shortly. Together, these countries increase our total addressable market by approximately 1 million people. And the overall international opportunity represents a significant long-term growth driver.\nOur global manufacturing capabilities offer another competitive advantage. And we are taking steps to further strengthen our operations. In addition to focusing on supply chain resiliency and ensuring critical component supply, we are also optimizing our international manufacturing footprint.\nThe current macro, inflationary and supply chain environment is challenging. However, our team has been successful in partially offsetting the inflation impact and has also mitigated supply chain risk to ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers. All of their accomplishments should help ensure we have ample component supply and available capacity to meet the demands of our customers, including our full launch of Omnipod 5. Wayde will discuss our manufacturing operations in more detail.\nIn closing, our first quarter results finished ahead of our expectations, and we are off to a great start in 2022. We are making terrific progress in the limited market release of Omnipod 5. And looking ahead, the balance of the year will include a number of important milestones, including the full commercial release of Omnipod 5, an expanded indication down to age 2 and advancement of our innovation pipeline. 2022 is going to be another exciting year for us as well as our customers across the globe.\nI'll now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP,CFO & Treasurer, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Shacey.\nBefore I get into our first quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to express my own gratitude towards Shacey and also do so on behalf of all of our employees. Her outstanding leadership and invaluable contributions to both the company and people living with diabetes has set up Insulet for a bright future. She embodies our mission. It has been an honor to learn from her and work alongside the group of leaders she has assembled here. We look forward to working with Shacey in her continued role as a Board member and as a company adviser and continuing to benefit from her insights and guidance.\nAt the same time, I'm excited to welcome Jim into his new position. It has been great working with Jim on the Board of Directors to date, and I echo Shacey's confidence in his deep understanding of our business, our culture and our team. And now on to our results.\nWe started the year off well with strong first quarter results, made notable progress in all of our strategic imperatives and are on a path for another successful year. In the first quarter, we generated 19% revenue growth, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 220 basis point headwind over Q1 of last year.\nWe delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth was driven by the compounding benefit from strong new customer starts as well as increasing volume growth through the U.S. pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove approximately 90% of our U.S. new customer starts and pharmacy channel volume increased to over 55% of our total U.S. volume.\nInternational Omnipod revenue grew 12% and was above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of the pandemic over the past year and AID competition headwinds. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 640 basis point headwind over prior year.\nOur estimated global attrition remains stable. Despite a shift in U.S. volume into the pharmacy channel, global pod utilization also remained consistent with historical seasonality as we typically see a sequential decrease in the first quarter of the year driven by the U.S.\nDrug delivery revenue increased 36%, exceeding our guidance range due to production timing. Gross margin was 71% and above our expectations, representing a 460 basis point increase or 490 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were improved manufacturing operations, growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and product mix. These were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations.\nAs a reminder, our current inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary headwinds in 2021 that continue in 2022. This will pressure gross margin sequentially each quarter this year as we sell the product out of inventory. I'll provide more color on our expected 2022 gross margin cadence in a few minutes.\nOperating expenses were in line with our expectations and reflect ongoing investments in innovation, sales and marketing and international expansion. Our focus to further strengthen these critical areas supports our long-term growth trajectory and expansion of our global addressable market. Operating margin was 12.8%, up 630 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.3%, up 740 basis points. Both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin improvement and to a lesser extent, timing.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and provides opportunities to continue to invest across our business. We've taken steps to further strengthen our global manufacturing scale and flexibility, including consolidating our production in China into our newer lower cost facility. We also expect to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. These actions are intended to support our international expansion strategy, further ensure product supply and drive margin improvement over time.\nNow turning to 2022 guidance. We are maintaining our full year revenue range of 12% to 16% and raising the low end for total Omnipod by 100 basis points to 16% to 20%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end by 100 basis points to 19% to 23%. Our growth within the type 1 and type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. The Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given we are in limited market release for part of 2022 and due to our annuity-based business model.\nFor international Omnipod, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by pandemic impacts and AID competition headwinds. As a reminder, we expect international revenue growth will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to a slightly easier comparison as well as an anticipated improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, we continue to expect drug delivery revenue to decline 30% to 35% as 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic.\nTurning to 2022 gross margin. Despite increasing inflationary and supply chain pressure, we continue to expect to achieve 67% to 68%. The drivers of the decline from last year remain the same: product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume; higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp; and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. All partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect gross margin to decline sequentially throughout the year due to the various factors discussed as well as higher component costs included in inventory.\nWe were happy to exceed 70% gross margin this quarter. And after working through inflationary impacts for the next couple of years, we still have plans to achieve 70% on a sustained basis over time.\nWe continue to expect operating expenses to rise sequentially in 2022 as we increase investments. Key areas of investments include our expanding innovation pipeline, direct-to-consumer advertising, clinical efforts and the launch of Omnipod 5. As a result of the higher macro and inflationary supply chain and foreign exchange pressures, we now expect operating margin to be flat year-over-year. Despite these headwinds, we are still focused on expanding operating margin over time.\nFor Q2, given both the expected sequential decline in gross margin and the increasing sequential investment to support the Omnipod 5 launch and other initiatives, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures will grow slightly this year as we continue to invest in key areas of our business.\nTurning to our second quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 12% to 15%, including total Omnipod growth of 17% to 20%. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate the unfavorable impact will be approximately 400 basis points on a reported basis.\nFor U.S. Omnipod, we expect to continue to build momentum with growth of 21% to 24%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model and growing Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. As a reminder and as planned, Omnipod 5 is still in limited market release and will not contribute materially to revenue growth in Q2.\nWe expect Q2 international Omnipod growth of 9% to 12%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021, largely due to the pandemic and competitive AID headwinds. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,100 basis points on a reported basis.\nFinally, we expect Q2 drug delivery revenue to decline 43% to 37% year-over-year, which is also a significant sequential decline as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. There will be choppiness in the remaining quarterly revenue based on our partners requested order patterns and timing of production.\nIn conclusion, we've begun 2022 much like we ended 2021, strong execution against our strategic imperatives that position Insulet well for long-term sustainable growth. While our mission has not changed, our ability to deliver on it only gets stronger. We've never been in a better position to improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nWith that, Dalam, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDeborah R. Gordon\n\nVP of IR, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you, Dilam. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2021 fourth quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements.\nWe'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey.\n\nShacey Petrovic\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Insulet Corporation\n\nThanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nOur fourth quarter results marked the end of another year of strong growth, successful execution across our strategic imperatives and advancement of our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. In 2021, we increased awareness and adoption of Omnipod in both the type 1 and type 2 market, continued to unlock access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, expanded internationally and strengthened our global manufacturing operations. That momentum has continued into 2022 with the recent FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which we could not be more excited about.\nWhile 2021 was a strong year, it certainly wasn't without its challenges, including the ongoing impact of the pandemic, global supply chain shortages and growing AID competition, particularly in our international markets. It is wonderful to see the global diabetes community embrace automated insulin delivery technology, and it is a clear indicator of how well received we believe Omnipod 5 will be. We are making great progress with our commercial rollout in the U.S. and advancing our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets.\nThe consistent strategic progress we have made is reflected in our financial results. In 2021, we surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue, in line with the goal we provided in 2016 as part of our long-range plan. 2021 also marked our sixth consecutive year of 20% or more revenue growth. And we now serve approximately 300,000 global customers using Omnipod.\nWe are already off to a terrific start in 2022 with a critical milestone: the FDA clearance and commercial launch of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless, automated insulin delivery system that offers full compatible smartphone control and an advanced algorithm residing on the Pod. It has taken incredible effort and commitment by the Insulet team to reach this groundbreaking achievement.\nOmnipod 5 marks the greatest and most complex innovation Insulet has brought to market in our company's 20-year history. It offers unmatched innovation with a patient-preferred form factor and it strengthens the value we provide customers today through our pay-as-you-go business model and U.S. pharmacy access. These distinctive benefits should provide us with unique competitive advantages in the market and will deliver life-changing technology to our customers.\nTaking a step back, diabetes is a growing epidemic and the global markets remain critically underserved with low pump utilization. However, people with diabetes are adopting wearable technology at an increasing rate as CGM use and awareness accelerate. Our efforts to improve access to and awareness of Omnipod, along with our customer-centric approach to innovation, are driving continued Omnipod adoption.\nIn the U.S., we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. And we remain a leader in the type 2 market based on our form factor, the simplicity of our technology, demonstrated outcomes and broad affordable access through the pharmacy. Type 2 continues to represent between 35% and 40% of our new customers in the U.S. These trends offer significant growth opportunities for Insulet over the long term. Given Omnipod's differentiated benefits as well as our relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience, we expect to continue to drive Omnipod penetration, expand our total addressable market and grow our global market share.\nI will now provide an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence.\nExpanding access to and awareness of Omnipod is essential to our strategy. Today, for more people than ever, Omnipod is available through our pay-as-you-go model in the U.S. pharmacy channel. The pharmacy provides easier access and lower costs for the majority of our customers. Payers and Omnipod users are not burdened with 4-year lock-in period. New technologies like Omnipod 5 can be adopted without upgrade or upfront fees, and supplies can be picked up conveniently from a nearby pharmacy.\nFor the payer, this means we assume the risk through our pay-as-you-go business model. And for the Omnipod user, it means easier access and affordability. The enhanced experience in the pharmacy is great and is exactly why we are investing to expand access here.\nThe primary driver of our growth over the last 2 years has been Omnipod DASH, and we have successfully secured broad access to this innovation globally. Almost all of our new customers in 2021 started on Omnipod DASH. And in the U.S., we've now secured almost 90% of covered lives for this product, primarily in the pharmacy.\nEssential to access is affordability. The vast majority of our U.S. consumers pay less than $50 each month for Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy. And the average is far less, with many customers paying nothing. While the cost to users of Omnipod DASH is on par with multiple daily injections, Omnipod provides improved outcomes and quality of life. We continue to look for ways to reduce cost and the logistical and administrative hurdles for all customers so they can access and afford Omnipod.\nOur efforts to raise awareness through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign is also helping to drive adoption. Our programs across the U.S. and select international markets are ramping and continue to drive a positive response and contribute to our customer growth. In 2022, we plan to expand our DTC efforts to drive increased awareness of Omnipod DASH and now, Omnipod 5. Given our success to date, we are excited to see the impact our DTC campaign will have once Omnipod 5 is fully launched.\nDelivering the best customer experience is at the heart of what we do. For 15 years, we've been using our unique form factor to simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 takes our innovation to the next level. It is the world's first home-controlled pod-based AID system, and we are confident it will build on our history of improving diabetes management as we leapfrog all other AID systems on the market.\nFull phone control is far beyond what others in the market have been working on. With full phone control, there is no separate controller and there is no traditional pump. The entire experience is on body and on phone. No tubes and no pulling out the pump to dismiss an alarm, change pump settings or prime infusion sets. Full phone control is the next level of simplicity and sophistication. And it is an experience that is only possible with a true wearable form factor like Omnipod.\nWe've redefined the category of insulin delivery. In addition to being the first tubeless, fully smartphone-controlled AID system, Omnipod 5 includes customizable set point, our SmartAdjust algorithm on the Pod and a novel Bolus calculator. This level of innovation required unusually complex regulatory submissions, including 3 510(k)s, 3 league reviewers at the agency and thousands of pages of data.\nOur limited market release has already begun, and the early customers are over the moon. Limited market releases are best practice with launches of major new innovations. And ours is designed to test our customer training and support systems, build access and ensure the best possible customer experience upon full market release.\nIn addition to product innovation, we have also transformed how users access Omnipod through the pharmacy. Customers can now enjoy a simple onboarding process and a modernized customer service platform. We can verify pharmacy benefits in seconds, streamline complex paperwork request, enable our field teams to manage their pipelines more efficiently and facilitate a 100% digital pathway to access our product.\nDuring 2021, our market access teams contracted strong coverage for Omnipod 5 prior to FDA clearance, and we are now able to move more swiftly to expand coverage further as many payers waited for clearance to establish coverage policy. We expect to be in limited release for 3 to 9 months and are excited to roll out our system more broadly as the year progresses.\nWe can't wait for everyone to experience the simplicity and improved outcomes enjoyed by our clinical study participants. Omnipod 5 is the most anticipated innovation within the diabetes community, and our team is laser-focused on ensuring the system is available to everyone.\nShortly after clearance, we also delivered our FDA submission to expand Omnipod 5's indication down to age 2. This is important as we know the tremendous benefits Omnipod 5 can provide this vulnerable population and their caregivers. And we continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022.\nWe recently completed our type 2 feasibility study and look forward to sharing results at the ATTD Diabetes conference in April. We will take the learnings from this study to design our pivotal study with the intent to deliver Omnipod 5 to the type 2 diabetes community. We have proven to be a pioneer in the type 2 space and expect continued strong adoption given the benefits of Omnipod DASH, our U.S. pharmacy channel access and now Omnipod 5.\nEven as we launch Omnipod 5, we continue to strategically invest in a robust product pipeline. Omnipod 5 is a platform that you'll see us advance in the coming years. Our iOS app development is making terrific progress as is our integration work with both Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre.\nBeyond Omnipod 5, we are focused in 3 areas. We are working on advancements that will grow our addressable markets, we are developing next-generation AID technology, and we are creating digital innovations and data products to make diabetes management easier for our Podders. Over the last several years, we have built on and enriched our digital platform capabilities. With SIM cards in every Omnipod 5 controller and by better aggregating and analyzing user level data, we can further enhance the customer experience for all stakeholders.\nWith these investments, we can improve outcomes, lessen the burden for both physicians and users by providing actionable insights, and develop more advanced future product offerings. These innovations will serve as another driver to secure Omnipod as the user preferred brand and strengthen our digital health capabilities. We have a sharp focus on our growing intellectual property as we create innovative new technologies and build on our strong existing patent portfolio.\nIn 2021, we filed more new patent applications than in any previous year. This will help ensure we are well positioned to deliver on our mission and provide differentiated and industry-leading innovation to people with diabetes for decades to come.\nThis past year, we built upon our 2020 expansion efforts and the rollout of Omnipod DASH across our international markets through targeted geographic expansion. We entered the Asia Pacific region through our entry into Australia and also expanded into Turkey. These efforts broadened access to Omnipod and strengthened our foundation for future growth. We expect additional market expansion in 2022 in the Middle East.\nOur efforts to deliver Omnipod 5 to our international markets are underway, we are making great progress, and I'm happy to share that we submitted for CE Marking in Europe. AID adoption is accelerating and while it presenting near-term headwinds, increasing market acceptance, reimbursement pathways and awareness of these technologies bode well for Omnipod 5 once we launch in our international market. We look forward to Omnipod 5 being the product of choice globally.\nMany additional people around the world would benefit from Omnipod, and we are focused on bringing it to them over time. We are building our international teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. Diabetes is underserved everywhere in the world and entering new markets represents a critical long-term growth driver for Insulet.\nInvesting in our manufacturing operations also remains a strategic priority as we build upon our established global capabilities and scale. We made great progress in 2021, including additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing operations and to secure uninterrupted access to critical components, creating a more resilient supply chain during these unprecedented times.\nWe can produce tens of millions of Pods a year and are extremely well positioned despite the challenging supply chain environment. Our team continues to execute remarkably well, successfully mitigating the impact on our business and on our customers. These efforts will support the full commercial release of Omnipod 5, the continued strong global demand we expect for Omnipod DASH, and our growing innovation pipeline. Our growth plans in 2022 and the years ahead will not be constrained by capacity.\nIn closing, we finished another strong year and are extremely excited about 2022. We expect to fully launch Omnipod 5 this year in the U.S. We are advancing our strategy to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets, and we have an exciting and robust innovation road map.\nOur success is due to our talented team and their unwavering commitment to our mission. We have built an amazing company and an award-winning culture. This past year, we were named a Great Place to Work in both the U.S. and the U.K., while also separately being recognized as one of the best workplaces for women. This past December, Drucker Institute listed Insulet as one of the top managed companies of 2021 based on customer satisfaction, employee engagement, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength.\nThese recognitions, in part, because they come directly from employee and customer feedback are wonderful reminders of the power of our people and our positive impact on one another in our communities and on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes.\nI'll now turn the call over to Wayde.\n\nWayde D. McMillan\n\nExecutive VP,CFO & Treasurer, Insulet Corporation\n\nThank you, Shacey.\nOur fourth quarter performance closed out another year of progress for Insulet on many fronts. Our focused investments and consistent execution of our strategic imperatives continue to strengthen our financial profile while driving meaningful value for all of our stakeholders.\nIn the fourth quarter, we generated 26% revenue growth, finishing above our guidance range with record U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 70 basis point headwind over the prior year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 28%, also exceeding our guidance range. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued through the fourth quarter, a primary reason for our strong U.S. revenue growth.\nAlso contributing was our success driving volume growth through the pharmacy channel due to continued Omnipod DASH adoption. Omnipod DASH drove over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 55% of our total U.S. volume. In Q4, international Omnipod revenue grew 6%, which was below our guidance range. Our growth was impacted by an estimated $5 million channel inventory reduction due to a European distributor returning to more normalized levels from the higher balance carried throughout much of the pandemic.\nThis occurred sooner than anticipated and was not fully factored into our guidance. It negatively impacted our Q4 growth rate by approximately 600 basis points. As a reminder, the majority of our revenue is sold through distributors in international regions and fluctuations in inventory levels can impact our results. We also continue to be affected by increasing AID competition and the compounding impact of the pandemic on our annuity model.\nOn a reported basis, for international Omnipod, foreign currency was a 180 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition and Pod utilization remained stable during Q4.\nDrug Delivery revenue increased 113% during the fourth quarter, finishing above our guidance range due to increased production volume driven by higher-than-expected demand from our partner. Gross margin was 69.3% in the fourth quarter, representing a 380 basis point increase or 370 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel, product mix and our improved manufacturing operations. These drivers were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing.\nOur year-end inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary pressure in 2021, and this is expected to continue in 2022. This will affect our gross margin in 2022 as we sell the product out of inventory. I will touch on that more in a few minutes.\nOperating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to strategically invest in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing operations and international expansion. These investments are designed to fuel sustainable long-term growth and expand our total addressable market while we further advance our mission. Operating margin was 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.7%. Both showed an increase over prior year and were in line with our expectations as we grow profitably while also investing across our business for long-term growth.\nTurning to full year results. We delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 19% and total company revenue growth of 20%, achieving another record year at $1.1 billion, demonstrating the strength and durability of our annuity model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable to 2021 total revenue by 180 basis points. In 2021, we achieved gross margin of 68.4%, up 400 basis points and in line with our expectations. We are benefiting from our growing scale and global manufacturing efficiencies and mix benefit from growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel, and we also had lower onetime costs associated with the pandemic. These drivers were partially offset by expected higher costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing.\nOperating margin was 11.5%, up 580 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 340 basis points. Both were a significant step-up from prior year and consistent with our expectations.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with over $790 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We entered 2022 in a strong financial position with a strategic road map to invest in critical areas of our business that will drive our innovation and growth for years to come. This past year, we took a series of steps to strengthen our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of capital. We are well positioned to finance our growth strategy.\nMore recently, in the current quarter, we finalized the strategic vertical integration acquisition of one of our suppliers, which brings key intellectual property and expertise in-house, allowing us to strengthen our competitive moat, production capabilities and efficiency, and drive further operational excellence while mitigating supply chain risks.\nWe have also taken additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities. We have optimized operations in China by consolidating production in that region into 1 location. We also plan to invest in a new international manufacturing location to further diversify globally, and increase efficiency, consistent with our goal to drive higher gross margins over time.\nNow turning to our outlook for 2022. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 15% to 20% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 16%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 23%. Our growth within type 1 and type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access.\nWe will also benefit from the commercial release of Omnipod 5, and we anticipate this latest innovation will begin to contribute to growth this year and even more so over the long term. We expect growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half as we gained momentum from the launch of Omnipod 5 begin to move past pandemic headwinds and realize the benefits of other commercial investments.\nAs a reminder, the launch of Omnipod 5 and its adoption ramp will take time due to the nature of our annuity model and given we are in limited market release for a period of time before transitioning to full market release.\nFor international Omnipod, we expect full year 2022 revenue growth in the range of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of AID competition and pandemic-related headwinds. We expect international to remain a long-term strategic growth driver, and we will continue investing with a focus to expand our global footprint and to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets.\nWe expect international revenue growth to also be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half, resulting from a slightly easier comparison as well as expected improving conditions related to COVID. For Drug Delivery, we expect revenue to decline 30% to 35% as levels were elevated during the pandemic.\nTurning to gross margin. For full year 2022, we expect to achieve gross margin of 67% to 68% and expect it to be higher in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. The expected decline from prior year is driven by product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume, higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. We expect this to be partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel.\nLooking beyond 2022, we fully expect to continue to expand gross margin over the long term as we begin to see the full benefit of our scale and manufacturing efficiencies. We still see 70% gross margin as a near to midterm goal, and we are driving toward it. During 2022, we expect operating expenses to rise slightly below our revenue growth as we further invest in key areas of our business while progressing our financial profitability. This includes investments in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, increased direct-to-consumer marketing and further scaling other commercial-related activities. We are also experiencing inflationary pressure within operating expenses.\n2022 will be a pivotal year as we launch Omnipod 5 and strengthen our position in a large and rapidly expanding market that remains underpenetrated. We continue to invest heavily in innovation as our team advances Omnipod 5 internationally, our iOS development effort, integration with Libre and G7 and much more.\nThis year, to make the most of our Omnipod 5 launch, we expect the majority of operating expense growth will be within SG&A. Even with our increased investments and pressure from inflation, we continue to target operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points each year, which is our goal over the short and midterm as we invest in long-term strategic growth drivers.\nAt the start of 2022, we adopted new accounting guidance that reduces most of the noncash interest expense associated with our convertible notes to an insignificant amount. Cash interest expense remains unchanged at approximately $30 million per year. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2022 will grow slightly from 2021 and with continued investment throughout our business.\nTurning now to our first quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect both total company growth and total Omnipod growth of 13% to 16%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 17% to 20%. We expect the core drivers will be the benefits of our recurring revenue model following consistent record setting new customer starts in 2021 and additional Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel.\nWe expect Q1 international Omnipod growth of 6% to 10%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition and the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021, largely due to the pandemic. Finally, we expect Q1 Drug Delivery revenue growth of 20% to 25%. Q1 is expected to be higher than each of the subsequent quarters in the year due to production timing.\nIn conclusion, we completed another solid year of growth and strategic progress. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 is launched, the preschool expanded indication filing is under active review at the FDA. We are advancing our type 2 initiatives and our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are progressing. We expect 2022 to be a transformative year as we advance our strategy and build upon our existing competitive advantages to position Insulet for sustainable growth for years to come.\nWith that, we will turn the call over to Dilam to open the call for questions."

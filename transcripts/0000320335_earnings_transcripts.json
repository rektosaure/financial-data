Third Quarter Earnings Release Call. My name is Jeannie, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Stephen Mota, Senior Director of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release 2024 10-K and a subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.\nSome of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, net income was $388 million or $4.73 per share, compared to $303 million or $3.44 per share a year ago.\nNet operating income for the quarter was $394 million or $4.81 per share, an increase of 38% over the $3.49 per share from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through September 30 is 21.9% and book value per share of $69.52. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity at 16.6% and book value per share as of September 30 is $93.63, up 12% from a year ago.\nBefore I discuss the third quarter insurance operations, I would like to revisit the nature of the market we serve. As most of you know, we serve the lower middle to middle income market. This market is vastly underserved and has significant growth potential, providing us with a distinct competitive advantage. This advantage is protected due not only to our ability to efficiently reach this market through both exclusive and direct-to-consumer distribution channels, but also due to the tremendous amount of data and experience we possess as we have been in the same market for over 60 years with essentially the same products.\nThe basic protection life and health insurance products we offer are specifically designed to help provide financial security to consumers in this market. We continue to be proud to serve this market and are grateful for the opportunity to help working family protect their financial future. In our insurance operations, total premium revenue in the third quarter grew 5% over the year ago quarter. For the full year 2025, we expect total premium revenue to grow approximately 5% as well, which is slightly higher than in 2024 and consistent with our 10-year average growth rate.\nLife premium revenue for the third quarter increased 3% from the year ago quarter to $844 million. Life underwriting margin was $482 million, up 24% from a year ago, driven by premium growth plus remeasurement gains due to good mortality experience, including the updating of both mortality and lapse assumptions. For the full year, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 3% and 3.5%. As a percentage of premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be between 44% and 46%. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 9% in the quarter to $387 million and health underwriting margin was up 25% and to $108 million due primarily to premium growth and remeasurement gains. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow in the range of 8% to 9% and anticipate health underwriting margin as a percent of premium to be between 25% and 27%.\nAdministrative expenses were $90 million for the quarter, an increase of 1% over the third quarter of 2024. As a percent of premium, administrative expenses were 7.3%. For the year, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 7.3% of premium, the same as in 2024.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the third quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. I'd like to start with a few comments about our exclusive agency force. We currently have over 17,500 exclusive agents that sell only for us. These agents are the strength to grow Globe Life.\nWhile we frequently see short-term agent count fluctuations in a stairstep pattern, this agency force has consistently generated significant long-term growth. In fact, the average agent count has nearly doubled over the past 10 years. The ability to maintain and grow an exclusive agency force is a core competency of our company. As a reminder, we typically recruit individuals who haven't previously sold insurance and are looking for a better opportunity. This provides us with an enormous pool of potential recruits that provides a tremendous growth opportunity going forward.\nAs we have mentioned in the past, there is a very close correlation between sales growth and agent count growth over the long term. And we are confident that our agent force will continue to grow, and our goal is to surpass 28,000 exclusive agents and $1.4 billion in annual sales by 2030.\nNow I'll discuss each distribution channel. First, let's start with our exclusive agencies, American Income, Liberty National and Family Heritage. At American Income, the life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $451 million. And the life underwriting margin was up 18% to $261 million. In the third quarter of 2025, net life sales were $97 million, flat compared to a year ago. But as a reminder, we had a difficult comparable this quarter as American Income had a 19% increase in life sales in the year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 12,230 up 2% from a year ago. We are currently focused on initiatives to enhance our recruiting as growth in agent count will lead to future sales growth.\nAt Liberty National, the life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $98 million, and the life underwriting margin was up 57% to $70 million. Net life sales were $24 million, flat from the year ago quarter, and net health sales were $8 million, up 4% from the year ago quarter. Average producing agent count for the third quarter was 3,847, up 1% from a year ago. We have a few initiatives underway that we expect to have a near-term positive impact. We have developed a new worksite enrollment platform designed to improve agent productivity and training. In addition, we are in the process of rolling out a new recruiting CRM which will further enable the use of data and analytics to enhance the recruiting process. I continue to be optimistic about the future growth of this agency.\nAt Family Heritage, the health premiums increased 10% over the year ago quarter to $119 million, and the health underwriting margin increased 49% to $51 million. Net health sales were up 13% to $33 million, and this is due to an increase in agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,553, up 9% from a year ago. And this is 5 consecutive quarters of strong agent count growth for family heritage. The continued focus of the past few years on recruiting and growing agency middle management has produced significant momentum and results.\nNow let's move on to our direct-to-consumer channel. In our DTC division of Globe Life, the life premiums were down 1% over the year ago quarter to $245 million while the life underwriting margin increased 29% to $114 million. While the life premiums were down slightly this quarter, net life sales were $27 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter. I'm very pleased to see this continued sales turnaround from the declining trend of recent years. As we mentioned on our last call, we have implemented new technology to enhance our underwriting process. This technology is helping improve the conversion of customer inquiries into sales.\nNow as a reminder, the value of our direct-to-consumer business is not only those sales directly attributable to this channel, but the significant support that is provided to our agency business through brand depressions and sales leads. We expect this division to generate approximately 1 million leads during 2025, which will be provided to our 3 exclusive agencies. Improved conversion of our direct-to-consumer leads across the enterprise allows us to increase our marketing spend and increase direct-to-consumer lead volume and marketing campaigns, which leads to sales growth in both our DTC and agency channels.\nUnited American is our General Agency division, and here, the health premiums increased 14% over the year ago quarter to $170 million, driven by the sales growth and Medicare supplement rate increases we have discussed previously. Health underwriting margin was $16 million, up $2 million from the year ago quarter. Strong activity across the entire agency resulted in net health sales of $25 million, an increase of approximately $9 million over the year ago quarter.\nNow I'd like to discuss projections. And based on the trends we are seeing, we expect the average producing agent count trends for the full year 2025 to be as follows: at American Income, an increase of around 2%, at Liberty National, an increase of around 4% and family heritage, an increase of around 8%. We Net life sales for the full year 2025 are expected to be as follows: American Income, an increase of around 3%, Liberty National, an increase of around 1% and direct-to-consumer, an increase of around 4%. Net health sales for the full year 2025 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, flat family heritage, an increase of around 13%, United American, an increase of around 50%.\nNow let's move on to projections for 2026. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect sales growth for the full year to be as follows. For net life sales, we expect American income to have mid-single-digit growth Liberty National high single-digit growth; direct-to-consumer, low single-digit growth. For net health sales, we expect Liberty National to have high single-digit growth; Family Heritage, low double-digit growth; and United American mid-single-digit growth.\nI'll now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We will now turn to investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less only required interest was $37 million down approximately $3 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $286 million in the quarter, slightly above last year's third quarter. The low growth of net investment income is consistent with the low growth in average invested assets.\nRequired interest is up approximately 1% over the year ago quarter, relatively consistent with the growth in average policy liabilities. As a reminder, the growth in average invested assets and average policy liabilities is lower than normal, primarily due to the impact of the annuity reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter of last year, which involved approximately $460 million of annuity reserves being transferred to a third party along with supporting invested assets. Net investment income was also negatively impacted in the current quarter by lower average earned yield as compared to a year ago. For the full year 2025, we expect net investment income to be flat and required interest to grow around 2%, resulting in a decline in excess investment income of around 10% to 15% for the year.\nThe growth in average invested assets for the full year is lower than normal due to the impact of the previously mentioned annuity reinsurance transaction as well as higher dividend distributions from the insurance companies to the parent.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $279 million in fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and industrial sectors. These investments were at an average yield of 6.33%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 29 years. We also invested approximately $86 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with debt-like characteristics and an average expected cash return of approximately 9%. None of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involve office properties. These non-fixed maturity investments are expected to produce additional cash yield over our fixed maturity investments while still being in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.26%, up 1 basis point from the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, the fixed maturity portfolio yield was 5.28%. Including the investment income from our commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and corporate owned life insurance investments, the third quarter earned yield was 5.46%. While we do own some floating rate investments, they are well matched with floating rate liabilities on the balance sheet.\nNow regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $21.5 billion, including $18.9 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.5 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of $1.1 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and it is mostly interest rate driven internally relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.\nBonds rated BBB comprised 43% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 46% from the year ago quarter. This percentage is at its lowest level since 2003. As we have discussed on prior calls, we believe the BBB securities we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. While the percent of our invested assets comprised of BBB bonds might be a little higher than some of our peers, remember that we have little or no exposure to other high-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities.\nBelow investment-grade bonds remain at historical lows at $455 million compared to $556 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to total fixed maturities is just 2.4%, are below investment-grade bonds as a percent of equity, excluding AOCI, are at their lowest level in over 30 years. While there is uncertainty as to where the U.S. economy is headed, we are well positioned to withstand a significant economic downturn due to holding historically low percentages of invested assets in BBB and below investment-grade bonds.\nIn addition, due to the long duration of our fixed policy liabilities, we invest in long-dated assets. As such, a critical and foundational part of our investment philosophy is to invest in entities that can survive through multiple economic cycles. In addition, we have very strong underwriting profits and long-dated liabilities so we will not be forced to sell bonds in order to pay claims. With respect to our anticipated investment acquisitions for the full year 2025, at the midpoint of our full year guidance, we assume investment of approximately $800 million to $850 million in fixed maturities at an average yield of around 6.4%. And approximately $300 million to $400 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics and an average expected cash return of 7% to 9%.\nAlso at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect the average yield earned on the fixed maturity portfolio to be around 5.27% for the full year 2025 and approximately 5.29% for the full year 2026. With respect to our commercial loans, limited partnerships and corporate-owned life insurance, we anticipate the yield impacting net investment income to be in the range of 7% to 8% for 2025 and 2026. In total, including these additional investments, we anticipate the blended earned yield to be approximately 5.45% in 2025 and in the range of 5.4% to 5.5% in 2026.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas George Gallagher\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThanks, Frank. First, I'll spend a few minutes discussing our available liquidity, share repurchase program and capital position.\nThe parent began and ended the quarter with liquid assets of approximately $105 million. We anticipate concluding the year with liquid assets in the range of $50 million to $60 million. In the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 840,000 shares of Global Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of approximately $113 million at an average share price of $134.17. Including shareholder dividend payments of $22 million for the quarter, the company returned approximately $135 million to shareholders during the third quarter and approximately $580 million year-to-date. We expect share repurchases will be approximately $170 million and anticipate distributing approximately $20 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments in the fourth quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter, share repurchases are higher than previously anticipated as we recently received approval for an extraordinary dividend from one of our subsidiaries, which will be -- which we anticipate will be available to support additional share repurchases by the parent. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate share repurchases will total $685 million in 2025. In addition, we intend to distribute approximately $85 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\nWe will continue to use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return of yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's excess cash flow after payment of shareholder dividends. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and is available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases. We continue to invest in our growth through investments in sales, technology and the insurance operations. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, implement new technologies, enhance operational capabilities, and modernize existing information technology as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs.\nFinancial strength is paramount to our company's success, and we believe the $500 million contingent capital funding arrangement established early in this quarter, will add to our already strong capital generation capabilities that exist within our insurance companies.\nNow with regard to capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital within our insurance operations at levels necessary to support our current ratings. To do that, Global Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. Although the target range is lower than many of our peers, it is appropriate given the stable premium revenue from the large number of in-force policies, the nature of our protection products with benefits that are not sensitive to interest rates or equity markets. Our conservative investment portfolio and strong consistent underwriting margins, which result in consistent statutory earnings at our insurance companies.\nAs we do every quarter, we performed stress tests on our investment portfolio under multiple economic scenarios, anticipating various levels of downgrades and defaults. If all estimated losses under our stress tests were to occur before year-end, which we believe is highly unlikely, we have concluded that we have sufficient capital resources exist within our subsidiaries and the parent to maintain our target RBC range and our share repurchases as planned. For 2025, we intend to maintain our consolidated RBC within the target range of 300% to 320%.\nAs previously discussed, we continue to progress towards establishing a Bermuda reinsurance affiliate for the purpose of reinsuring a portion of new business and in-force life insurance policies issued by Global Life affiliates. We currently estimate parent excess cash flow will increase from incremental earnings from our U.S. and Bermuda subsidiaries over time as the reinsurance block grows. This additional excess cash flow will enhance the financial strength of the company and provide additional flexibility, allowing the company to meet various capital and liquidity needs of the parent. We continue to make progress on the required regulatory filings and subject to approvals, we anticipate executing the first reinsurance transaction by the end of 2025, and we will provide an additional update on our next call.\nNow with respect to policy obligations for the current quarter. Each year, GAAP accounting requires us to review and generally update actual assumptions for mortality, morbidity and lapses. We have chosen to review and update as necessary both our life and health reserve assumptions in the third quarter each year. The remeasurement exhibit included in our supplemental financial information available on our website includes the impact of these assumption changes as well as experience related remeasurement gains and losses by distribution channel. When assumption changes are made, GAAP accounting standards require a cumulative catch-up adjustment going back to January 1, 2021, the transition date for LDTI. This cumulative catch-up is the assumption related remeasurement gain or loss. An assumption remeasurement gain lowers the reserve balances and indicates an improved outlook as less premium is needed to fund reserves to meet future policy obligations. The opposite is true if there is an assumption to remeasurement loss.\nFor the quarter, the overall impact of both life and health assumption changes reduced policy obligations by $134 million, with life obligations reduced by $131 million and health obligations reduced by approximately $3 million, indicating an anticipation of an improved outlook for future policy obligations. To put this into perspective, total GAAP life and health reserves on our balance sheet are approximately $19 billion, so the adjustment to reserves is less than 1%.\nTo better understand the performance of the business, we think it is beneficial to look at normalized underwriting margins, which exclude the impact of assumption changes and provide an improved basis for comparison of quarterly results. For the third quarter, normalized life underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 41.5% compared with 40.4% for the year ago quarter, which is a notable improvement and reflects recent favorable mortality experience. Normalized health margin as a percent of premium was 27.2% compared with 27.5% for the year ago quarter. For the Health segment, as expected, health margins as a percent of premium continued to increase from the first half of the year. This is largely driven by margin increases from the Medicare supplement business as 2025 premium rate changes became fully effective.\nSo now with respect to guidance for 2025. For the full year 2025, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $14.40 to $14.60, representing 17% growth at the midpoint of our range and 11% growth when excluding the impact from assumption updates in both '24 and '25. The midpoint is higher than our previous guidance due to the anticipation of continued favorable mortality experience.\nFinally, with respect to 2026 guidance. For the full year 2026, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $14.60 to $15.30 representing 3% growth at the midpoint of the range. The growth rate is lower than historical averages given the significant impact of the assumption updates in 2025. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate total premium revenue growth of 6% to 7%, with life premium revenue growth growing 4% to 5% and health premium revenue growing 9% to 11%. We anticipate underwriting margins as a percent of premium to be in the range of 40% to 43% for life and 24% to 27% for health. We anticipate net investment income growth will be approximately 3%.\nAlthough 2025 statutory results are not final for the year, we anticipate parent excess cash flows available to return to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases in 2026 will be approximately $600 million to $700 million. This is greater than the amount available in 2025, excluding the impact of extraordinary dividends. On the next call, I'll provide an update as we get updated statutory results for 2025 and after we finalized the initial reinsurance transactions for the new Bermuda subsidiary.\nThose are my comments, and now I'll turn it back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments, and we will now open the call up for questions."

Second Quarter Earnings Release Call. My name is Laura, and I will be a coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded.

Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Combat, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that provided for general guidance purposes only.

In the second quarter, net income was $253 million or $3.05 per share compared to $258 million or $2.83 per share a year ago. .\nNet operating income for the quarter was $271 million or $3.27 per share, an increase of 10% over the $2.97 per share from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through June 30 is 18.8%, and book value per share is $66.07, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity is 14.4% and book value per share as of June 30 is $90.26, up 10% from a year ago.\nIn our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue for the second quarter increased 3% from the year ago quarter to $840 million. Life underwriting margin was $340 million, up 6% from a year ago, driven by premium growth or overall policy obligations. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 3.5%. As a [indiscernible] premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be between 43% and 45%, which is higher than our previous estimate, continued favorable mortality.\nIn Health Durante, premium revenue grew 8% to $378 million, while health writing margin was down 2% to $98 million due primarily to higher obligations than the year ago period at United American. Tom will talk more about the Medicare Supplement business in his comments, but I would like to point out here that we saw a slight reduction in utilization from first quarter to the second quarter, resulting in an underwriting margin at United [indiscernible] as a percent of premium at the high end of our expectations. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow in the range of 8% to 9% and anticipate health underwriting margin as a percent of premium to be between 25% and 27%.\nAdministrative expenses were $86 million for the quarter, an increase of approximately 5% over the second quarter of 2024. As a percent of premium, administrative expenses were 7.1%. For the year, we expect administrative expenses to increase by about 4% over 2024 and be approximately 7.3% of premium, lower than noted on the last call.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the second quarter marketing operations.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Frank. I'll start by addressing recent agent count trends. Each of the exclusive agencies increased average agent count from the first quarter to the second quarter, for a combined sequential growth rate of 6%, resulting in an average total agent count of 17,621 for the second quarter. We've seen strong results over the past several months in agent recruiting and onboarding. While rapid increases in new agents can have an impact on productivity in the short term, this bodes well for sustainable future growth. .\nThe exclusive agencies are the strength of Globe Life and the ability to maintain and grow an exclusive agency force is a core competency of our company. While we frequently see short-term fluctuations, there is a very close correlation between sales and agent count over the long term. Now I'll discuss each of the distribution channels. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $446 million, and the life underwriting margin was up 6% to $205. In the second quarter of 2025, net life sales were $96 million, up 2% from a year ago.\nAnd as a reminder, we had a difficult comparable this quarter as American Income had a 16% increase in life sales in the year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 12,241, up 3% from a year ago. I am confident we will continue to see growth in this agency as we move forward.\nAt Liberty National, the life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $97 million. And the life underwriting margin was up 8% to $33 million. Net life sales decreased 5% to $25 million, and net health sales were $8 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter. The decreases were primarily due to lower productivity. Additionally, we had a higher comparable this quarter as [indiscernible] National had an 11% increase in our sales in the year ago quarter.\nThe average producing agent count for the second quarter was 3,882, up 5% from a year ago. Liberty National continues to have positive agent count growth, which is a good leading indicator for continued sales growth. At Family Heritage, the health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $116 million, and the health underwriting region increased 12% to $41 million.\nNet health sales were up 20% to $30 million due to an increase in agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was $1,498 and up 10% from a year ago. And I'm excited to see this continued growth, this is 4 consecutive quarters of strong agent count growth for family heritage. Now in our direct-to-consumer division, here, the life premiums were down 1% over the year ago quarter to $246 million, while life underwriting margin increased 8% to $69 million.\nNet life sales were $31 million, and this is up 2% from the year ago quarter and up 24% from the first quarter. I'm very pleased to see these results as this is a turnaround of a declining trend in recent years. As we mentioned on the last call, we have been working on implementing new technology to enhance our underwriting automation. This technology is helping improve the conversion of inquiries into sales. The resulting improvement in return on marketing investment could allow us to reinstate some of the marketing campaigns that were discontinued in the past due to high marketing costs. Now as a reminder, the value of direct-to-consumer business is not only those sales directly attributable to this channel but the significant support that is provided to our agency business through [indiscernible] and sales leads.\nWe expect this division to generate approximately 1 million leads during 2025, and which will be provided to our 3 exclusivities. Improved conversion of our direct-to-consumer leads across the enterprise will allow us to increase our marketing spend and increase future lead volume and marketing gains. Now on to United American General Agency. Here, the health premiums increased 10% over a year ago quarter to $164 million. and this is driven by prior year -- strong prior year sales growth and premium rate increases. Health underwriting margin was $12 million, down $4 million from the year ago quarter due to higher claim costs. Net health sales were $25 million, up approximately $7 million over the year ago quarter. We continue to see strong individual Medicare supplement sales activity.\nNow I'd like to discuss projections and based on these recent in our experience with our business, we expect the average producing agent count trends for the full year 2025 to be as follows: at both American Income, Evry National mid-single-digit growth at Family Heritage, high single to low double-digit growth. Net life sales for 2025 are expected to be as follows: at American Income and Liberty National, both mid-single-digit growth direct-to-consumer low single-digit growth. Net health sales for 2025 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National mid-single-digit growth; Family Heritage, low double to mid-teens growth and United American double-digit growth.\nI'll now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We'll now turn to the embedment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest was $35 million. down approximately $8 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $282 million, down 1% and average invested assets were relatively flat. Required interest is up approximately 2% over the year ago quarter, consistent with growth in average policy liabilities.\nThe growth in average invested assets and average policy liabilities are lower than normal, primarily due to the impact of the annuity reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter last year, which involved approximately $460 million of annuity reserves being transferred to a third party, falling with supporting invested assets. Net investment income was also negatively impacted by lower average earnings rates on our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments in the current quarter as compared to a year ago.\nFor the full year 2025, we expect net investment income to be up about 1% and required interest to grow around 2.5%, resulting in a decline in excess investment income of around 10% to 15% for the year. While the growth in average invested assets will be lower than normal for the full year due to the impact of the annuity reinsurance transaction last year, as well as higher dividend distribution from the insurance companies.\nWe do anticipate sequential growth in the third and fourth quarters, which should set us up well for more normalized growth in 2026. Now regarding our investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $263 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. These investments were at an average yield of 6.44% an average rating of A and an average life of 34 years. We also invested $68 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with debt-like characteristics, and an average expected cash return of approximately 9.7%. None of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involve office properties. These non-fixed maturity investments are expected to produce additional cash yield over our fixed maturity investments. while still being in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.29%, up 3 basis points from the second quarter of 2024. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.26%. Including the investment income from our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships, the second quarter earned yield was 5.38%. Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $21.5 billion, including $18.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-.\nOverall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A-, the same as a year ago. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.6 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and it is mostly interest rate driven and currently relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Bonds rated BBB priced $0.44 of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 46% from the year ago quarter.\nThis percentage is at its lowest level since 2006. As we have discussed on prior calls, we believe the BBB securities we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. While the percent of our invested assets comprised of BBB bonds might be a little higher than some of our peers, remember that we have little or no exposure to other higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities.\nThe low investment grade bonds remain at historical lows at $503 million compared to $564 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to total fixed maturities is just 2.7%. Our below investment grade bonds as a percent of equity, excluding AOCI, are at their lowest level in over 30 years. While there are clearly uncertainties as to where the U.S. economy is headed, we are well positioned to stay a significant economic downturn. Due to the long duration of our fixed policy liabilities, we invest in long-dated assets.\nAs such, a critical and foundational part of our investment philosophy is to invest in entities that can survive through multiple economic cycles. In addition, we have very strong underwriting profits and long-dated liabilities. So we will not be forced to sell any of our bonds in order to pay claims. With respect to our anticipated investment acquisitions for the full year, at the midpoint of our full year guidance, we assume investment of approximately $900 million to $1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of around 6.2%, and approximately $200 million to $300 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics, at an average expected cash return of 7% to 9%.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. I'll spend a few minutes discussing our available liquidity, share repurchase program and capital position. The parent began the quarter with liquid assets of approximately $90 million and ended the quarter with approximately $105 million of liquid assets. We anticipate concluding the year with liquid assets in the range of $50 million to $60 million. For the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of Global Life common stock for a total cost of approximately $226 million at an average share price of $121.13. Thus, including shareholder dividend payments of $22 million for the quarter, the company returned almost $250 million to shareholders during the second quarter of 2025. This amount is greater than what we indicated on the prior call, as we took advantage of declines in the price of our stock, which created market conditions more favorable for repurchases during the quarter.\nThe parent's liquid assets at the end of the quarter, along with excess cash flow expected to be generated for the second half of the year will provide the [indiscernible] with $240 million to $290 million that we expect to return to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases after meeting the anticipated needs of the parent. We will continue to use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives.\nThus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's excess cash flow after the payment of shareholder dividends. We also intend to reduce the outstanding commercial paper balances over the course of the year to be more in line with historical levels. For the full year, we anticipate share repurchases will total $600 million to $650 million and we intend to distribute $80 million to $90 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\nRemaining share repurchases will be spread over the remainder of the year with approximately $100 million to $125 million expected in the third quarter. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, implement new technologies, and enhanced operational capabilities and modernize existing information technology as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs. At the beginning of the third quarter, we strengthened our financial preparedness through the issuance of a 30-year $500 million contingent capital funding arrangement. This arrangement complements our existing capital resources and enhances our financial flexibility by providing additional source of committed long-term capital regardless of capital mix and economic conditions.\nThis transaction has no impact on the company's debt has finance costs of just under $9 million pretax per full year. Overall, we believe that financial strength is paramount to our company's success, and this arrangement will simply add to our already strong capital generation capabilities that exist within our insurance companies. With regards to the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital within our insurance operations at levels necessary to support our current ratings. Global Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%.\nAs of year-end 2024, our consolidated RBC ratio was 36% and which provides approximately $100 million of capital more than what is needed to meet our minimum target capital of 300%. As we do every quarter, we performed stress test in our investment portfolio under multiple economic scenarios, anticipating various levels of downgrades and defaults. If all of the estimated losses under our stress tests were to occur before year-end, which we believe is highly unlikely, we have concluded sufficient capital resources exist within our subsidiaries and the parent to maintain our target RBC ratios and our share repurchases as planned.\nFor 2025, we intend to maintain our consolidated fee within the targeted range of 100% to 320%. As I said on the call, I would like to share an update with our progress towards establishing a Bermuda reinsurance affiliate. During the quarter, we submitted a preliminary business plan to the Bermuda Monetary Authority for the [indiscernible] to establish an affiliate reinsurer in Bermuda for the purpose of reinsuring a portion of new business and in-force life insurance policies issued by Globe Life affiliates. An updated business plan, along with the formal licensing application will be submitted in the third quarter, and we anticipate establishing our Bermuda reinsurance entity and executing the first reinsurance transaction by the end of the year.\nDuring the finalization of the application and licensing process, we need to have dialogue with regulators as well as rating agencies, and we will continue to provide additional information as warned on future calls. This initial reinsurance transaction is currently intended to reinstill small block of life reserves to get the company up and running. However, we invite that over time, approximately 1/4 of total statutory life reserves may be ceded to our Bermuda subsidiary as a portion of new business and additional business is reinsured. Of course, we have not completed our evaluation and our final business plan has not been approved, so they change over time. At this time, we are not contemplating any changes to our overall investment strategy will be needed.\nOur decision to pursue this new Bermuda captive reinsurer is for the following strategic reasons. First, Bermuda's economic capital Frank will better support Globe Life's continued sales and premium growth rates, which are generally above industry average. We are also very comfortable with Bermuda's statutory framework as it is consistent with U.S. GAAP and capital is determined under an economic framework. This supports earnings emergence consist with GAAP earnings, which, over time, will provide additional dividend competing to the parent, enhancing the parent's overall financial strength and flexibility.\nIn addition, Bermuda is an established and stable regulatory environment with international insurance industry experience. Bermuda regulators have been actively engaged in discussions with us and have developed a good understanding of our business and the insurance products we intend to reinsure with the new entity. [indiscernible] approval of reciprocal jurisdiction, which we will seek to obtain as soon as possible.\nWe currently estimate parent excess cash flow will increase from incremental earnings from our U.S. and Bermuda subsidiaries over time as the reinsurance block grows. This additional excess cash flow will enhance our financial strength of the company and provide additional flexibility for the company to meet various capital and liquidity needs of the parent. There is still a lot of work in front of us as regulators and rating agencies to finalize plans. While we do anticipate any additional parent excess cash flows until 2027, we do see the potential for additional distributable earnings from our subsidiaries to the parent trending over time towards $200 million annually as earnings emerge from reinsuring additional in-force and new business.\nThis will provide additional financial flexibility for the parent to support our growth. Now with regards to policy obligations for the current quarter. As we discussed on prior calls, we have included within our supplemental financial information available on our website an exhibit that details remeasurement gains and losses by distribution channel. For the quarter, we continue to experience favorable mortality results resulting in life remeasurement gains. The life remeasurement gain was $16.7 million, reflecting mortality and lapse experience for the quarter. This was favorable to management's estimates and resulted in lower life policy obligations than anticipated.\nThe health remeasurement gain was about $3.9 million was favorable to management's estimates and contributed to favorable obligation trends at Family Heritage and experience fluctuations for other health lines, including Medicare supplement. There have been no changes to our long-term assumptions this quarter as we will update life and health assumptions in the third quarter of 2025. Due to the continued favorable mortality we are experiencing, we are increasing our estimate on the margin impact for the third quarter life assumption updates as recent mortality and lapse experiences are incorporated into these assumptions.\nAlthough we have not finalized our assumption updates, we have updated and revised our estimates for the anticipated impacts. At this time, our guidance anticipates a total remeasurement gain in the third quarter related to both life and health assumption updates to be in the range of $110 million to $160 million. At this time, our current estimates for life assumption updates reflect future mortality levels generally in line with pre-pandemic levels. It should be noted that recent mortality experience is favorable to prepandemic levels overall, and to the extent this continues, we would expect continued quarterly remeasurement gains even after updating long-term assumptions.\nFor the Health segment, as expected, health margins as a percent of premium increased from the first quarter. This was largely driven by anticipated margin increases from the Medicare supplement business as 2025 premium rate changes became fully effective. In addition, we saw some improvement in Medicare supplement claims, which were favorable to our expectations. The claim cost trends continue to run higher than those reflected in our recent rate filings. We intend to reflect these higher trends in our 2026 rate filings to improve long-term profitability consistent with those needed to achieve historical margins as a percent of premium. Our estimate for total remeasurement gains related to assumption updates include an estimate of $5 million to $15 million related to the Health segment. Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2025. For the full year 2025, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $14.25 to $14.65, representing 17% growth at the midpoint of our range and 10% growth when excluding the impact of remeasurement gains from assumption updates in both 2024 and 2025.\nThe midpoint is higher than our previous guidance due to the anticipation of continued favorable mortality experience and the updated anticipated impact of third quarter assumption updates. In addition, we anticipate health margins will improve slightly relative to our prior expectations.\nThose are my comments. I will now turn it back to Matt.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments. We will now open the call for questions. ."

My name is Allen, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Stephen Mota, Senior Director of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release in 2024 10-K on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, net income was $255 million or $3.01 per share compared to $254 million or $2.67 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $259 million or $3.07 per share, an increase of 10% from a year ago and slightly higher than our internal projections. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through March 31 is 19% and book value per share is $64.50. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity is 14.1% and book value per share as of March 31 is $87.92, up 11% from a year ago. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue for the first quarter increased 3% from the year ago quarter to $830 million. Life underwriting margin was $337 million, up 9% from a year ago, driven by premium growth and lower overall policy obligations. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 4%. As a percent of premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be between 42% and 44%. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 8% to $370 million, while health underwriting margin was down 10% to $85 million due primarily to higher claim costs in United American resulting from higher utilization. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% and anticipate health underwriting margin as a percent of premium to be between 24% and 26%. Administrative expenses were $88 million for the quarter. The increase over the year-ago quarter is primarily due to higher information technology employee and legal costs. For the year, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 7.4% of premium. I will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the first quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $438 million, and the life underwriting margin was up 5% to $196 million. In the first quarter of 2025, net life sales were $99 million, up 1% from a year ago. And as a reminder, we had a difficult comparable this quarter as American Income had a 17% increase in life sales in the year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 11,510, up 3% from a year ago. The average agent count declined from the fourth quarter, but I would attribute this to the tremendous agency growth produced over the last couple of years. From the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2024, average agent count grew 29%, and it is typical for our agencies to see some contraction after periods of significant recruiting success. We are pleased to see productivity has increased as more agents are submitting weekly, and I'm confident we will see continued growth in this agency going forward.\nNow at Liberty National, here, the Life premiums grew 6% over the year ago quarter to $96 million, and life underwriting margin was up 3% to $32 million. Net life sales increased 4% to $22 million, while net health sales were $7 million, down 5% from the year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 3,688 and this is up 8% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the agent count rose at Liberty National which is primarily driven by recruiting activity and growth in agency middle management and is a good leading indicator for continued sales growth at this division.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $112 million, and health underwriting margin increased 10% to $39 million. Net health sales were up 7% to $27 million, and this is due primarily to an increase in agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was $1,417, up 9% from a year ago. And this is 3 consecutive quarters of strong agent count growth for this division and is driven by this agency's focus on recruiting and middle management development. In our direct-to-consumer division, the life premiums were down 1% over the year ago quarter to $246 million. While life underwriting margin increased 10% to $64 million. Net life sales were $25 million, down 12% from the year ago quarter. And as we have previously mentioned, the continued decline in sales is primarily due to lower customer inquiries as we have reduced marketing spend on certain campaigns that did not meet our profit objectives as a result of higher distribution costs.\nOur focus in this area is having a positive impact on our overall margin as we will continue to focus on maximizing the underwriting margin dollars on new sales by managing the rising advertising and distribution costs associated with acquiring new business and the value of our direct-to-consumer business is not only those sales directly attributable to this channel, but the significant support that is provided to our agency business through brand impressions and sales leads. And as we mentioned last year, we expect this division to generate over 750,000 leads during 2025, which will be provided to our exclusive agencies.\nNow on to United American General Agency. Here, the health premiums increased 13% over the year-ago quarter to $160 million, driven by strong prior year sales growth. Health underwriting margin was $2 million, down approximately $10 million from the year ago quarter due to higher claim costs resulting primarily from higher utilization. For the year, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in underwriting margin due to strong sales and premium rate actions. And as a reminder, the majority of the premium rate increases for 2025 on individual Medicare supplement business will take effect starting in the second quarter.\nNet health sales were $28 million, and this was up $11 million from the year ago quarter. Now I'd like to discuss projections. And based on recent trends we are seeing in our experience with our business, we expect the average producing agent count trends for the full year 2025 to be as follows: At American Income, mid-single-digit growth; at Liberty National, high single-digit growth; and at Family Heritage, low double-digit growth, and we are reaffirming the life and health sales guidance we gave on last earnings call. And as a reminder, net life sales for 2025 are expected to be as follows: American Income, high single-digit growth; Liberty National, low double-digit growth; direct-to-consumer, low to mid-single-digit growth. And for health sales, we expect Liberty National Family Heritage and in United American General Agency to all have low double-digit growth.\nNow before I turn the call back over to Frank for investment operations, I want to note that with respect to the inquiries made by the SEC and the DOJ discussed on previous calls, there have been no material developments to disclose at this time. To the extent there is further information to share on any of these items, we will update you accordingly. I'll now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Now turning to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less on the required interest was $36 million, down approximately $8 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $281 million, down 1% from the year ago quarter as compared to a 1.3% growth in invested assets. Required interest is up a little more than 2% over the year ago quarter, consistent with growth in average policy liabilities. The growth in average invested assets and average policy liabilities are lower than normal due to the impact of the annuity reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter, which involved approximately $460 million of annuity reserves being transferred to a third party along with supporting assets.\nNet investment income was also negatively impacted by lower short-term interest rates. For the full year 2025, we expect net investment income to be fairly flat and required interest to grow around 2.5%, resulting in excess investment income to be down 7% to 15% for the year. With regard to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $245 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. These investments were at an average yield of 6.4% at an average rating of A- and an average life of 43 years. We also invested approximately $51 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with net light characteristics and an average expected cash return of approximately 8.5%. None of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involved office properties. These non-fixed maturity investments are expected to produce an additional cash yield over our fixed maturity investments while still being in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.25%, up 1 basis point from the first quarter of 2024. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was 5.26%. Including the investment income from our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships, the first quarter earned yield was 5.4%. Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $21.4 billion, including $19 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.5 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A- same as a year ago. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.5 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position as it is mostly interest rate driven and currently relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Bonds rated BBB comprise 45% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 47% from the year ago quarter. This percentage is at its lowest level since 2007, as we have discussed on prior calls, we believe the BBB securities we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nWhile the percentage of our invested assets comprised of pleasant might be a little higher than some of our peers, remember that we have little or no exposure to other higher risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Below investment grade bonds remain at historical lows at $506 million compared to $542 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to total fixed maturities is just 2.7%. Our below investment-grade bonds as a percent of equity, excluding AOCI, are at their lowest level in over 30 years. While there are clearly uncertainties as to where the U.S. economy is headed in the upcoming months, we are well positioned to withstand a significant economic downturn. Due to the long duration of our fixed policy liabilities, we invest in long-dated assets. As such, a critical and foundational art of our investment philosophy is to invest in entities that can survive through multiple economic cycles. In addition, we have very strong underwriting profits and long-dated liabilities. So we will not be forced to sell any of our bonds in order to pay claims.\nWith respect to our anticipated investment acquisitions for the year, at the midpoint of our full year guidance, we assume investment of approximately $600 million to $700 million in fixed maturities at an average yield of 6% to 6.2% and approximately $300 million to $500 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics at an average expected cash return of 7% to 9%.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nI'll spend a few more minutes discussing our available liquidity, share repurchase program and capital position. The parent began the year and ended the quarter with liquid assets of approximately $90 million. We anticipate concluding the year with liquid assets at the higher end of our targeted range of $50 million to $60 million. During the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of below life common stock for a total cost of approximately $177 million at an average share price of $121.70, thus, including shareholder dividend payments of $20 million. For the quarter, the company returned approximately $197 million to shareholders during the first quarter of 2025. The parent's liquid asset at the end of the quarter, along with the excess cash flows expected to be generated over the last 3 quarters of the year, will provide the parent with [ $375 million ]to $725 million to meet the -- sorry, $675 million to $725 million to meet the needs of the parent or that or that can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases.\nIn April, we used approximately $47 million to repurchase Globe Life common stock. And for the remainder of 2025, we anticipate using approximately $65 million for shareholder dividends. The total amount of excess cash flows in 2025 is higher than in 2024 primarily because of higher statutory earnings in 2024 than in 2023 and due to the inclusion of an extraordinary dividend of approximately $190 million approved late in 2024. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, primarily results from the dividends received by the parent permits subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and is available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases.\nWe will continue to use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return renewable to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends. However, we also intend to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances over the course of the year to be more in line with historical levels. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to new -- to issue new insurance policies implement new technologies and enhance operational capabilities and modernize existing information technology as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs.\nThe remaining amount is sufficient to support our targeted capital levels at our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program in 2025. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $600 million to $650 million of share repurchases will occur over the full year. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. As of year-end 2024, our consolidated RBC ratio was 316%, which provides approximately $100 million of capital in excess of that needed to meet our minimum target capital of 300%. As we do every quarter, we have performed stress tests in our investment portfolio under multiple economic scenarios, anticipating various levels of downgrades and defaults. If the estimated losses under our stress -- stress tests were to occur before year-end, we have concluded that we have sufficient capital to [ man ] our target RBC ratios, given the current excess capital at our subsidiaries and capital resources of the parent, while maintaining our share repurchases as planned. For 2025, we intend to maintain our consolidated RBC within the targeted range of 300% to 320%. In addition, as mentioned on previous calls, we continue to evaluate the opportunity to manage capital under an economic framework available in Bermuda. We expect to conclude this work in 2025 and intend to provide an update on the strategic decisions made on the next call.\nNow with regards to policy obligations for the current quarter. As we discussed in prior calls, we have included within the supplemental financial information available on our website and exhibit that details the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. For the quarter, life remeasurement gain was $8.5 million. This was favorable to management's estimates and resulted in lower life policy obligations than anticipated. The health remeasurement gain was about $400,000. In other life distribution, during the quarter, we completed the recapture of a reinsurance agreement that involved a small block of business associated with our military life business. This resulted in a onetime favorable impact to life margins of approximately $14 million. There have been no changes to our long-term assumptions this quarter as we will update life and health assumptions in the third quarter of 2025. Due to the continued favorable mortality we are experiencing, we anticipate a favorable margin impact in the third quarter for life assumption updates as recent mortality and lapse experience are incorporated into these new assumptions.\nAt this time, our guidance anticipates a remeasurement gain in the third quarter related to life assumption updates in the range of $60 million to $100 million similar to third quarter's life remeasurement gain last year. As Frank mentioned, we anticipated life margins as a percent of premium to be in the range of 42% to 44% for the full year. However, for the first half of the year, we expect life margins as a percent of premium to be in the range of 40% to 41% and 43% to 46% in the second half of the year, given the anticipated favorable impact from third quarter life assumption updates.\nFor the Health segment, we anticipate health obligations will continue to be elevated given recent claim trends outpacing premium rate increases on individual and group Medicare supplement business. This appears to be largely impacted by an increase in a select set of procedures taking place in doctors' offices. In addition, although a portion of the premium rate increases for '25 were effective late in the first quarter, the majority are effective in April, and we will reflect -- in addition, we will reflect recent claim trends in our 2025 premium rate filings, which will be effective in 2026.\nSo finally, with respect to earnings guidance in 2025. For the full year 2025, we reaffirm our previous guidance and estimated net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $13.45 to $14.05, representing 11% growth at the midpoint of our range. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Those are our comments, and we will now open up the call for questions."

My name is Alan, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Stephen Mota, Senior Director of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJoining the call today are Frank Svoboda, and Matt Darden, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2023 a 10-K and a subsequent Form 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the fourth quarter, net income was $255 million or $3.01 per share compared to $275 million or $2.88 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $266 million or $3.14 per share, an increase of 12% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through December 31st is 21.7%, and book value per share is $62.5. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity is 15.1% and book value per share as of December 31st is $86.40, up 13% from a year ago.\nIn our life insurance operations, premium revenue for the fourth quarter increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $823 million. Life underwriting margin was $336 million, up 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by premium growth and lower overall policy obligations.\nIn 2025, we expect life premium revenue to grow at the midpoint of our guidance in the range of 4.5% to 5% compared to 4% growth for 2024. As a percentage of premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be between 40% and 42%. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 7% to $358 million, while health underwriting margin declined 6% to $91 million due primarily to higher claim costs at United American resulting from higher utilization.\nIn 2025, we expect health premium revenue to grow in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% compared to 6.5% growth for 2024. We also expect health underwriting margin as a percent of premium to be between 25% and 27%. We are pleased with the overall premium growth we saw in 2024 as the 4.7% growth in total premium income was well above the 3.4% growth rate in 2023. This is especially encouraging as we come out of the high inflationary period that has put a stress on the U.S. consumer, especially those in the demographic we serve and demonstrates the resiliency of our business. Due to the continued efforts of our sales and conservation teams, we anticipate this growth rate to accelerate and be even higher in 2025.\nAdministrative expenses were $91 million for the quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher information technology costs related to maintaining IT software and services employee costs and legal expenses. While our expenses in the fourth quarter were higher than prior quarters, they were largely in line with our expectations. In 2025, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 7.4% of premium.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the fourth quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank.\nAt American Income Life, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $433 million, and Life underwriting margin was up 9% and to $199 million. In the fourth quarter of 2024, net Life sales were $93 million, and this is up 22% from a year ago and primarily due to increased productivity and agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 11,926, up 7% from a year ago. This growth is due to the continued focus on recruiting and improved new agent retention, and I continue to be very pleased by the momentum at American Income.\nAt Liberty National, our life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $94 million. And the Life underwriting margin was up 8% to $34 million. Net Life sales increased 1% to $26 million, while net health sales were $9 million, down 5% from the year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 3,743, up 11% from a year ago. And I'm excited to see the continued agent count growth at Liberty National, which is primarily driven by our recruiting activity and agency Middle Management growth. And I am confident that this growth in agent count and agency Middle Management will drive strong sales growth in 2025.\nAt Family Heritage, the health premiums increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $111 million, and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $40 million. Net health sales were up 6% to $27 million due primarily to an increase in agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,512, and this is up 11% from a year ago, and I continue to be pleased to see the agent count growth, which is driven by this agency's efforts in recent quarters to emphasize recruiting and middle management development. In our direct-to-consumer division at Global Life, life premiums were down 1% over the year ago quarter to $245 million, while life underwriting margin increased 20% to $71 million. Net life sales were $23 million, down 11% from the year ago quarter. Now as we've mentioned previously, the continued decline in sales is primarily due to lower customer inquiries as we have reduced our marketing spend on certain campaigns that did not meet our profit objectives as a result of higher distribution costs. Our focus in this area is having a positive impact on our overall margin as we will continue to focus on maximizing the underwriting margin dollars on new sales managing the rising advertising and distribution costs associated with acquiring new business. The value of our direct-to-consumer business is not only those sales directly attributable to this channel but the significant support that is provided to our agency business through brand impressions and sales leads. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect this division to generate over 750,000 leads during 2025, which will be provided to our 3 exclusive agencies. At United American General Agency, here the health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $151 million, driven by strong progress sales growth of 23%. Health underwriting margin was $5 million, down approximately $9 million from the year ago quarter due to higher claim costs resulting primarily from higher utilization. For the full year 2025, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in our underwriting margin due to strong sales and premium pricing actions. Net health sales were $30 million, up 7% over the year ago quarter.\nNow I'd like to discuss our projections. And based on the recent trends and our experience with our business, we expect the average producing agent count trends for the full year 2025 to be as follows: at American Income, mid-single-digit growth at Liberty National low double-digit growth; and at Family Heritage, also low double-digit growth. We'd also like to reaffirm our life and health sales guidance we gave on our last earnings call. And as a reminder, this was not -- where net life sales for 2025 are expected to be as follows: American Income, high single-digit growth; Liberty National, low double-digit growth and our direct-to-consumer division, low- to mid-single-digit growth. Now for health sales, we expect Liberty National Family Heritage and United American General Agency to all have low double-digit growth.\nNow before I turn the call back over to Frank for investment operations, I'd like to make a few brief comments regarding the inquiries made by the SEC and DoJ that we have previously discussed. While these inquiries are still open, there have been no material developments and neither agency has asserted any claims or made any obligations against Globe Life or AIL, and we're not aware of any actions being contemplated by the SEC or the DoJ. And with respect to the EEOC matter, as of now, there have been no material developments to share outside of what was disclosed within our 10-Q as filed on November 6, 2024. And to the extent there's further information to share on any of these items, we will update you accordingly.\nI'll turn the call back now to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt.\nWe'll now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less only required interest. It was $38 million, up $3 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $282 million, up 4% or $11 million from the year ago quarter. The increase is largely due to the 3% growth in average invested assets over that period and to a lesser degree, higher interest rates. Required interest is up 3.5% over the year ago quarter, in line with the growth in average policy liabilities. For the full year we expect net investment income to be fairly flat and require interest to grow around 2.5%. The growth in both our average invested assets and our average policy liabilities is lower than historical levels due primarily to the reinsurance of approximately $460 million of our [indiscernible] force annuity reserves that we noted on our last call. This agreement was effective November 1. In addition, the impact of higher subsidiary dividends to the parent in 2025 will also contribute to lower average invested asset growth. As such, we anticipate excess investment income to be flat to down 15%.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $378 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. These investments were at an average yield of 5.83% at an average rating of A- and an average life of 35 years. We also invested approximately $52 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with deadline characteristics and an average expected cash return of approximately 8.5%. None of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involve office properties. These non-fixed maturity investments are expected to produce additional yield overall fixed maturity investments while still being in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.27%, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 2 basis points from the third quarter. As of December 31, the portfolio yield was 5.25%. Including the cash yield from our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships, the fourth quarter earned yield was 5.41%.\nNow regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $21.2 billion, including $18.8 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.7 billion due to the current market rate being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and is mostly interest-rate driven and totally relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Bonds rated BBB comprised 46% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 48% from the year ago quarter. This percentage is at its lowest level since 2007. As we have discussed on prior calls, we believe the BBB securities we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. While the percent of our invested assets comprised of BBB bonds might be a little higher than some of our peers, remember that we have little or no exposure to other higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Below investment-grade bonds remain at historical lows at $525 million compared to $530 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to total fixed in 30s is just 2.8%.\nAt the midpoint of our guidance, for the full year 2025, we expect to invest approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.5% to 5.7%. And approximately $300 million to $500 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt like characteristics and an average expected cash return of 7% to 9%.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of approximately $48 million and ended the year with approximately $90 million. In the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 338,000 shares of Global Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of approximately $36 million at an average share price of $105.37. This was slightly higher than we had anticipated in the quarter. For the full year, we purchased 10 million shares for a total cost of $946 million at an average share price of $93.76, including shareholder dividend payments of $85 million the company returned slightly more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2024. In addition to liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company will generate excess cash flows during 2025. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less interest paid on debt. Although our statutory results are not final, we anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year of 2025 will be approximately $785 million to $835 million. Excess cash flows are anticipated to be higher in '25 than in '24, primarily as resulting from higher statutory earnings in '24 than in 2023 as well as the impact of previously discussed reinsurance transactions completed in 2024. Statutory income in 2024 is anticipated to be higher than statutory income in 2023, primarily from favorable investment results, statutory reserve changes, improved mortality results and lower realized losses. At the midpoint of our guidance, anticipated excess cash flows are expected to be used to distribute approximately $85 million to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and reduced commercial paper to more historical levels, with the remainder expected to be used for share repurchases in the range of $600 million to $650 million, absent an alternative use with a higher return to our shareholders. We anticipate liquid assets at the parent of around 69 at the end of the year. We still believe share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends.\nWith regards to capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries, our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. Global Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC in the range of 300% to 320%. Since our statutory financial statements are not yet final, our consolidated RBC ratio is not yet known. However, we anticipate the final 2024 RBC ratio will be within our targeted range.\nNow with regards to policy obligations for the current quarter, as we discussed on prior calls, life and health assumption changes were made in the third quarter. No assumption changes were made in the fourth quarter. The supplemental financial information available on our website provides us exhibit that details the quarterly remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. For the fourth quarter, life obligations continue to be favorable when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency resulting in lower policy obligations and a $19 million remeasurement gain related to experience fluctuations. For the full year, encompassing both assumption changes and experience-related fluctuations, the remeasurement gain from the Life segment resulted in $107 million of lower life policy obligations and for the Health segment, $3 million of higher health policy obligations. In recent quarters, mortality trends in the Life segment has been favorable relative to our long-term assumptions. If mortality continues to develop favorably over the next couple of quarters, life obligations will be favorable relative to our long-term assumptions, resulting in life remeasurement gains. Conversely, if mortality experience is higher than our long-term assumptions, we will experience life remeasurement losses. Recent mortality and lapse experience will inform future updates to long-term assumptions, which we intend to make in the third quarter of 2025. For the Health segment, we anticipate health obligations for our Medicare supplement and group retiree health products will continue to be elevated given recent claim trends outpacing premium rate increases.\nFinally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2025, for the full year 2025, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in a range of $13.45 to $14.05, representing 11% growth at the midpoint of our range. The $13.75 midpoint is higher than our previous guidance due to the favorable mortality experience we've seen in recent quarters and the anticipation that these favorable mortality trends will continue into 2025, resulting in improved life underwriting margins.\nThose are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments, and we will now open the call up for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'd like to hand the call over to Stephen Mota. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2023 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.\nSome of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, net income was $258 million or $2.83 per share compared to $215 million or $2.24 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $271 million or $2.97 per share, an increase of 14% from a year ago.\nOn a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through June 30 is 20.8% and book value per share is $58.06. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, return on equity is 14.5% and book value per share as of June 30 is $82.38, up 14% from a year ago.\nBefore we continue, we would like to address and advance the status of the independent review conducted by the Audit Committee of Globe Life's Board of Directors regarding allegations levied against the company by short sellers. On June 22, 2024, Globe Life filed an 8-K addressing this matter. As noted in the 8-K, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors conducted an independent investigation of allegations contained in various short seller reports. The Audit Committee was assisted in its review by the law firm, WilmerHale, and the forensic accounting firm, FTI Consulting.\nThe scope of the independent review included all allegations that raise specific questions about the accuracy and integrity of the company's financial statements and disclosures. It also included the company's process for preventing, identifying and responding to misconduct.\nAs stated, the Audit Committee has completed its review and determined that the allegations of financial misconduct were not supported. Additionally, the independent review did not identify any matters requiring adjustments to the company's previously issued financial statements or related disclosures in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe believe the allegations were false and misleading and were designed to drive down Globe Life's stock price in an effort for the short sellers to profit at the expense of our long-term shareholders. The company stands by its financial results and disclosures, which remain accurate and do not require any adjustments.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and confirmed that the company has policies and procedures in place designed to safeguard the quality of the work experience. Compliance with our code of conduct, both internally and in connection with our third-party relationships, is and will continue to be a key focus area for management.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nIn separate but related issues, we'd like to update you regarding the inquiry by the SEC and the request by the DOJ. As we have previously disclosed, the company received an inquiry from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company and the Audit Committee have provided information in response to the SEC's request received to date. And the company is cooperating fully and will continue to do so. At this time, the SEC has not asserted any claims against the company or indicated it intends to do so.\nRegarding the DOJ, we continue to fully cooperate in responding to requests related to sales practices by certain licensed insurance agents in Arias Organization who are contracted to sell American Income policies. The DOJ has not asserted any claims or made allegations against the company or American Income or indicated it intends to do so.\nIn conclusion, we'd like to discuss the questions we have received regarding ongoing litigation and the company's process for identifying, assessing and remediating complaints related to alleged misconduct.\nThe various allegations are subject of litigation in a variety of stages. And as you can appreciate, it would not be appropriate for us to comment on terminated contracts or pending lawsuits. But as we've discussed in prior calls, Globe Life takes unethical conduct and any allegations brought to our attention concerning harassment, inappropriate conduct or unethical business practices seriously, and we do not tolerate such behavior. The company has reasonable and appropriate systems in place that are designed to detect and mitigate misconduct and attempted fraudulent activities.\nGlobe Life has a long history of integrity in our business practices and principles while providing our customers with financial protection as well as work opportunities for agents, small business owners and employees to build financial security. We are focused on results and the continued strategic growth of Globe Life. Our field force of approximately 17,000 agents and our 3,500 employees are focused and dedicated to helping families make tomorrow better by working to protect their financial futures. And together, we strive to act in accordance with the highest levels of ethics and integrity at all levels of the organization.\nNow Frank, let's talk about our results with respect to our insurance operations.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue for the second quarter increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $815 million. Life underwriting margin was $320 million, up 8% from a year ago, driven by the premium growth and lower overall policy obligations. For the year, driven by strong premium growth in both our American Income and Liberty National divisions, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 4.5% and 5% at the midpoint of our guidance and life underwriting margin to grow between 9% and 10%. As a percent of premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be in the range of 39% to 41%.\nIn health insurance, premium grew 7% to $352 million, and health underwriting margin was up 9% to $100 million. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow approximately 6.5% to 7%. And at the midpoint of our guidance for the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow between 1% and 2%, and as a percent of premium to be between 27% and 29%.\nAdministrative expenses were $82 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 7%, consistent with our expectations, compared to 6.8% a year ago. For the full year 2024, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 7% of premium.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the second quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. First, I'd like to discuss American Income Life. Here, the life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $424 million, and the life underwriting margin was up 7% to $193 million. In the second quarter of 2024, net life sales were $95 million, and this is up 16% from a year ago and is primarily due to the strong growth in our agent count.\nThe average producing agent count for the second quarter was 11,869, and that is up 13% from a year ago. We are seeing strong recruiting activity along with continued improvement in new agent retention. Our new [indiscernible] pipeline for the second quarter is up 16% from the prior year, and I'm very pleased with the sales productivity and agent count trends at American Income.\nAt Liberty National, the life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $92 million, and the life underwriting margin was up 9% to $31 million. Net life sales increased 11% to $26 million, and net health sales were $8 million, which is up 4% from the year ago quarter. Growth in both the life and the health sales was due primarily to the increase in agent count.\nThe average producing agent count for the second quarter was 3,700 and is up 16% from a year ago. Liberty National continues to generate positive recruiting and sales momentum, and this is driven by our investments in technology and the growth in middle management.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $106 million, and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $37 million. Net health sales were up 7% to $25 million, and this is primarily due to an increase in agent productivity.\nThe average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,361, and this is up 1% from a year ago. And as we've said before, we continue to emphasize recruiting and middle management development at Family Heritage. And I'm encouraged as we have started to see middle management growth, which is up 11% from year-end.\nIn our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums were flat compared to the year ago quarter at $249 million, while the life underwriting margin increased 13% to $64 million and is due primarily to favorable mortality and continued efforts to maximize our margin dollars. Net life sales were $31 million and is down 3% from the year ago quarter.\nAs we have previously mentioned, the decline in sales is primarily due to lower customer inquiries as we have reduced marketing spend on certain campaigns that do not meet our profit objectives. Our focus in this area is having a positive impact on our overall margin.\nWe will continue to focus on maximizing underwriting margin dollars on new sales by managing the rising advertising and distribution costs associated with acquiring new business. Additionally, as a reminder, the direct-to-consumer channel provides support to our agency business through brand impressions and the generation of sales leads.\nAt United American General Agency, our health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $149 million. Health underwriting margin with $17 million and is up approximately $2 million from the year ago quarter. Net health sales were $18 million, and this is up approximately $7 million over the year ago quarter and it's due primarily to improved market conditions for our Medicare Supplement business.\nNow I'd like to discuss projections. Based on the trends that we are seeing and the experience with our business, we expect the average producing agent count trends for 2024 to be as follows: at American Income, low double-digit growth; at Liberty National, mid-teens growth; and at Family Heritage, mid-single-digit growth.\nNow our net life sales for 2024 are projected to be as follows. At American Income, mid-teens growth. Now here, we are raising our guidance at American Income to reflect strong second quarter experience along with the trends we are seeing. Last quarter, we had tempered our projections just out of an abundance of caution. Liberty National sales anticipate low double-digit growth and direct-to-consumer slightly down.\nNet health sales for 2024 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, high single-digit growth; and at Family Heritage, also high single-digit growth; and United American General Agency, low to mid-single-digit growth.\nI'll turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less only required interest, was $43 million, up $11 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $286 million, up 9% or $24 million from the year ago quarter. The increase is largely due to strong 6% growth in average invested assets over that period. In addition, higher interest rates across fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and short-term investments also contributed to the higher growth rate.\nAcquired interest is up approximately 5.5% over the year ago quarter, slightly higher than the 5% growth in average policy liabilities. For the full year, we expect net investment income to grow between 7% and 8% due to the combination of the favorable interest rate environment and steady growth in our invested assets. In addition, at the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate required interest will grow around 5% to 5.5% for the year, resulting in growth in excess investment income of approximately 20% to 25%.\nNow with respect to our investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $241 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 6.16%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 35 years. We also invested approximately $115 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics, and an average expected cash return of 10%. None of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involved office properties. These investments are expected to produce additional cash yield over our fixed maturity investments and they are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.26%, up 8 basis points from the second quarter of 2023 and up 2 basis points for the first quarter. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.24%. Including the cash yield from our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships, the second quarter earned yield was 5.44%.\nNow regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $21.3 billion, including $19.2 billion from fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.\nOur fixed maturity portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.6 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position as it is mostly interest rate driven and currently relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.\nBonds rated BBB comprised 46% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 49% from the year ago quarter. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets helped by many of our peers, such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, real estate, equities, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. We believe that the BBB securities we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nBelow investment-grade bonds remained below at $564 million compared to $496 million a year ago. The average of below investment grade bonds to total fixed maturities is 2.9%. During the quarter, we did take the opportunity to extend duration on a portion of our portfolio by selling some shorter maturity bonds and investing in longer-dated securities. While we realized a loss on some of the months sold, we were able to extend the average life and improve the overall yield of the portfolio and we're able to reduce our exposure to smaller regional banks.\nAt the midpoint of our guidance for the full year, we expect to invest approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in fixed maturities and an average yield of 5.7% to 5.9%, and approximately $500 million to $600 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics and an average expected cash return of 8% to 10%.\nAs we've said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact to our future policy benefits since they are not interest sensitive.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. First, let me spend a few minutes discussing our available liquidity, share repurchase program and capital position. Parent began the quarter with liquid assets of approximately $65 million and ended the quarter with approximately $35 million of liquid assets. We anticipate concluding the year with liquid assets in the range of $50 million to $60 million that we have historically targeted.\nIn the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of just over $314 million at an average share price of $81.87, resulting in repurchases to date of approximately 4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $330 million at an average share price of $83.17. Including shareholder dividend payments of $23 million for the quarter, the company returned approximately $337 million to shareholders during the second quarter of 2024 alone and has returned approximately $375 million year-to-date.\nThe amount of share repurchases during the quarter is higher than usual as we took the opportunity to accelerate repurchases from the second half of the year given the favorable market conditions with share prices below our book value per share. We are able to finance this largely with excess cash flows during the quarter due to the timing of subsidiary dividends and the use of parent's liquid assets.\nIn addition to the liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company will generate excess cash flows during the remainder of the year. The parent company's excess cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from dividends received from the parent from its subsidiaries less interest paid on debt. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $440 million to $460 million and is available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends and through repurchases.\nAs mentioned on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. At this time, we believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary source -- sorry, the primary use of the parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends.\nWe intend to use 2024 excess cash flows to purchase $350 million to $370 million during the year and distribute $85 million to $90 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. In addition, during the second half of the year, we anticipate raising additional capital to support accelerating approximately $400 million of additional share repurchases in 2024. So for the full year, at the midpoint of our earnings guidance, we anticipate approximately $750 million to $770 million of total share repurchases for the full year.\nNow with regard to our capital levels at the insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At the end of 2023, our consolidated RBC was 314%, At this ratio, our subsidiaries had, at that time, approximately $85 million of capital over the amount needed to meet the low end of the consolidated RBC target of 300%. In 2024, we currently estimate that no additional capital is needed to maintain the midpoint of our consolidated RBC target of 300% to 320%.\nNow with regards to policy obligations during the current quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we have included within the supplemental financial information available on our website and exhibit that details the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2023, we updated both our life and health assumptions, and there have been no changes to our long-term assumptions in the period since. No assumptions were made in the second quarter of 2024, and we intend to update life and health assumptions in the upcoming third quarter.\nIn addition to the impact of assumption changes, the remeasurement gain or loss also indicates experienced fluctuations. For the second quarter of 2024, life policy obligations were favorable when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency. The remeasurement gain related to experience fluctuations resulted in $12 million of lower life obligations and $3 million of lower health policy obligations.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the recent short-term trends and policy obligations experience. The range of our earnings guidance encompasses potential future remeasurement impacts, inclusive of assumption changes through the remainder of 2024. Recent and longer-term life and health mortality trends will inform the third quarter 2024 update to assumptions.\nSo now finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2024. For the full year 2024, we estimate that operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $11.80 to $12.10, representing 12% growth at the midpoint of the range. The [ $11.95 ] midpoint is higher than our previous guidance and reflects recent anticipated improvements in underwriting income results in addition to a greater impact from share repurchases than previously anticipated for the year.\nThose are my comments, and I'll now turn it over back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments, and we will now open the call up for questions."

First Quarter Earnings Release Call. My name is George. I will be coordinating at today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Stephen Mota, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release and 2023 10-K on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, net income was $254 million or $2.67 per share, compared to $224 million or $2.28 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $264 million or $2.78 per share, an increase of 10% from a year ago.\nOn a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through March 31 is 21.3%, and book value per share is $53.3. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity is 14.3% and book value per share as of March 31 is $79, up 12% from a year ago.\nBefore we continue, we'd like to take a moment to address ahead of time questions many of you may have regarding dismissed litigation against the company, the DOJ inquiry, and the recent attack on the company by a short seller. For over 70 years, our business model has stood the test of time. And as we will further discuss today, we continue to generate sustainable earnings growth that provide long-term value for our shareholders. With over 17 million policies in force, our millions of customers value the protection of the company's products, and we strive to be there when our customers need us most.\nWe want to assure you that Globe Life, its management and our Board of Directors strive to act in accordance with the highest level of ethics and integrity at all levels of the organization. While we believe the short seller's claims present a false and misleading overall picture of the company and its subsidiaries, as a demonstration of our commitment to operating ethically, the company's Audit Committee has retained the international law firm, WilmerHale, to conduct an independent review of the assertions in the short seller's report.\nAs you can appreciate, given the ongoing nature of the DOJ's investigation and out of respect for the integrity of the independent review initiated by the Audit Committee, we are limited in what we can say. For this reason, we will not be taking any additional questions on these issues today, although our intent is to address questions we understand you may have to the extent possible. We will provide updates as and when appropriate.\nFirst, we want to provide a brief update on the status of the lawsuit filed by claimant Renee Zinsky, a former independent contractor sales agent, which, as many of you know, included allegations of sexual harassment and purported fraud joint business practices, neither of which we tolerate, and the claim that she was misclassified as an independent contractor. On September 27, 2022, the claim had filed the demand for arbitration and participated in the selection of the 3 arbitrator panel. After 1.5 years of litigation, the arbitration hearing was scheduled to begin on March 4, 2024.\nThe night before the hearing, the claim had sought to dismiss her claims without obtaining any relief or payment. After a lengthy discussion on the record, the panel dismissed the case with prejudice, and on April 3, 2024 of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania affirmed the dismissal with prejudice.\nOn March 14, 2024, Global Life filed an 8-K addressing this matter in more detail, and the court filings are publicly available for those interested. Also noted in our Form 8-K, Global Life and American Income received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania. These subpoena sought documents related to sales practices by certain licensed insurance agents in the areas of organization who are contracted to sell American Income policies.\nThe company and American Income is in the process of responding to these subpoenas, which were received in late 2023, and have been fully cooperating with the DOJ. The DOJ has not asserted any claims or made allegations against the company and American Income with respect to the foregoing investigation. And the company currently is not aware that any legal proceedings are contemplated by governmental authorities.\nWhile no assurances can be made and we are still evaluating the matter, management did not believe when the subpoenas were received, and does not believe now, that it is either reasonably possible or probable this investigation will result in material liability to the company. As such, the company did not disclose the existence of the request from the DOJ in its Form 10-K. We are providing additional information regarding this matter to you now in light of recent questions that have been raised.\nMatt?\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. Most recently, both the litigation and the DOJ's investigation were the subject of a lengthy attack on the company by a short seller. As we have stated publicly, we believe the report mischaracterizes many facts and it relies on anonymous sources, dismissed lawsuits and allegations that have not been proven in litigation to present a false and misleading overall picture of Global Life and American Income.\nIn this instance, we believe the short seller's report demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the life insurance business generally and about how our company operates and reports revenue. As we have disclosed in our annual reports and audited financial statements, Globe Life recognizes revenue from premiums for long-duration life and health insurance products over the life of the contract and when payments are due from the policyholder. Therefore, premium revenue closely matches the cash we collect monthly.\nFor example, during the fiscal year 2023, American Income's collected premium payments and reported GAAP premium income were essentially the same at $1.6 billion. A history of American Income's collected premium as compared to its reported GAAP premium is included in the supplemental financial information available on the Investors section of our website.\nNow we only report net sales and policies after they have been through our underwriting and quality control processes. And as disclosed in our public filings, when calculating net sales for American Income, we exclude policies that are canceled in the first 30 days after issue.\nFundamentally, the success of our business depends on our underwriting rigor and our ability to continue selling policies to customers who keep their policies and pay their premiums over time. Now this builds a solid book of business, and we have continued to do so year-over-year. In fact, over 80% of American Income's total life premiums are received from policies that have been in force for over 1 year. Please see our first year renewal GAAP premium page under the Financial Reports and Other Financial Information in the Investors section of our website.\nNow the more than 11,000 independent agents who sell American income policies offer products designed to help families make tomorrow better by working to protect their financial future. Each agency office has a structured hierarchy, whereas agents above the writing agent receive an override commission paid by the company. While there is a hierarchy, there is no pyramid scheme as the policies require customers to pay the monthly premium for the policy to continue. There is no third-party payer of premiums.\nIt is important to note this business model has stood the test of time and is common in the industry. American Income realizes revenue and profits only when these customers pay their premiums over time. We have generated consistent growth, providing long-term value for our shareholders, with a history of integrity in our business practices and principles while providing our customers with financial protection when it matters most, as well as job opportunities for agents, small business owners and employees to build financial security.\nNow these agents are independent contractors and the agency offices are independent businesses. Notwithstanding their independence, Globe Life takes unethical agent conduct seriously, and has measures to detect and deter actions that are inconsistent with the company's values, including, among others, American Income has internal controls and monitoring processes in place to identify potential agent misconduct, and monitors relevant data metrics for each individual agent to identify and assess trends regarding unethical or fraudulent business practices, including data related to policy lapse and persistency.\nNow our annual policy count and phased amount lapse rates are disclosed in our regulatory filings and our quarterly premium in-force lapse rates are disclosed each quarter in the supplemental financial information we provided. These controls also include background checks on all prospective agents. Agents who contract with American Income must have a valid license issued by the appropriate state departments of insurance who have their own processes for determining one's suitability to be a licensed insurance agent.\nAmerican Income has controls to validate the indemnity and legitimacy of the sale to the customer, including conducting quality assurance calls to verify new applications. And when complaints are raised, including complaints alleging fraud, deceit, unethical business practices or other misconducts, American Income has a dedicated group responsible for investigating these allegations. American Income has not hesitated to take disciplinary actions against agents and agency owners where warranted, including termination and notice to the appropriate regulatory bodies.\nIndeed, the short seller's report relies heavily on allegations by a former employee who, following an internal review, was terminated for cause based on violations of the company's policies prohibiting sexual harassment. This matter is the subject of pending litigation. The companies investigate complaints when they are received and, where appropriate, authorizes independent investigations.\nThe report also contains allegations regarding bribery and kickback schemes. These claims are based on a lawsuit that was filed by an insurance licensing exam test prep company. This lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. American Income does not contract with or recommend any test prep companies to prospective agents, and we're not aware of any bribes or kickbacks to the company executives.\nAdditionally, we want to make clear that the projections and guidance we will be providing on this call today incorporate our current view based on our knowledge of the business and the information we have at this time. Now with respect to our insurance operations, I'll turn the call back over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. In our life insurance operations. Premium revenue for the first quarter increased 4% from the year-ago quarter to $804 million. Life underwriting margin was $309 million, up 6% from a year ago.\nFor the year, driven by strong premium growth in both our American Income and Liberty National divisions, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 4.5% and 5% at the midpoint of our guidance, and life underwriting margin to grow between 7% and 7.5%. As a percent of premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be in the range of 38% to 40%.\nIn health insurance, premium grew 6% to $341 million, and health underwriting margin was up 3% to $94 million. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow around 7%. At the midpoint of our guidance for the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow between 5% and 6%, and as a percent of premium, to be around 27% to 29%.\nThe final tri-agency rule regarding various health plans was finalized with minimal impact to the supplemental health products we sell and, therefore, to our business. The final rule requires an additional consumer disclosure, which we will implement as required.\nAdministrative expenses were $80 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. As a percent of premium, administrative expenses were 7%, consistent with our expectations and compared to 6.7% a year ago. For the year, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 7% of premium, higher than 2023, due primarily to continuing investments in technology as we modernize and transform how we operate.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the first quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. First, let's discuss American Income Life. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 7% over the year-ago quarter to $414 million, and life underwriting margin was up 7% to $187 million. In the first quarter of 2024, net life sales were $97 million, which is up 17% from a year ago quarter, primarily due to growth in agent count.\nThe average producing agent count for the first quarter was 11,139. This is up 15% from a year ago. This is another strong quarter for American Income and builds on the growth in sales and agent count that we achieved in the third and fourth quarter of 2023.\nAt Liberty National, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $91 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $31 million. Net life sales declined 2% to $22 million, and net health sales were $8 million, up 7% from a year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count.\nNow as a reminder, we report on sales after the policy has been through our quality control and underwriting processes. As we have previously discussed, we continue to make investments in technology to enhance our business. One of these investments is a new business and underwriting platform for our life business at Liberty National, which we implemented toward the end of the first quarter. As a result of this system implementation, our policy [ issues fee ] temporarily slowed down. Now I'm pleased to see that the amount of business submitted from the field to the underwriting department is up 11% from the prior-year quarter. Now I anticipate as we finalize our transition to this new system, our throughput of policies will return to historical norms.\nThe average producing agent count for the first quarter was 3,419, up 14% from a year ago. We continue to be proud of the strong agent count growth at Liberty National.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $103 million, and health underwriting margin increased 13% to $36 million. Net health sales were up 11% to $25 million, and this is due to increased agent productivity enabled by our investments in technology. Average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,295, approximately flat from a year ago. Family Heritage continues to focus on agent count and middle management growth.\nNow let's discuss Direct to Consumer. In our Direct to Consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums were flat compared to the year-ago quarter at $248 million, while life underwriting margin increased 4% to $59 million. Net life sales were $29 million, down 12% from the year ago quarter. And as we have previously disclosed, this decline is primarily due to lower customer inquiries as we have reduced marketing spend on certain campaigns that did not meet our profit objectives.\nWe will continue to focus on maximizing the underwriting margin dollars on new sales by managing the rising advertising and distribution costs associating with acquiring this new business. Additionally, the Direct to Consumer channel provides critical support to our agency business through brand impressions and the generation of sales leads.\nNow let's discuss United American General Agency. Here, the health premiums increased 7% over the year-ago quarter to $142 million. Health underwriting margin at $12 million is down approximately $1 million from the year ago quarter. Net health sales were $16 million, up 7% over the year ago quarter, due to strong activity in the individual Medicare supplement business.\nNow let's discuss projections. Now based on the trends that we are seeing and our experience with our business, we expect the average annual producing agent count trends for 2024 to be as follows. At Liberty National, mid-teens growth. At Family Heritage, low single-digit growth.\nNet life sales for 2024 are expected to be as follows. For Liberty National mid-teens growth, Direct to Consumer slightly down. Net health sales for 2024 are expected to be as follows. Liberty National, mid-teens growth; Family Heritage, low double-digit growth. United American General Agency, low to mid-single-digit growth.\nNow based on very recent events, we are actively evaluating the impact on AIL's agent count and projected sales for the remainder of the year. Now to date, we have not seen a significant impact on our agent recruiting pipeline. As the majority of our business is produced by experienced agents, any negative recruiting trends should have a muted impact on 2024 sales.\nIn addition, it should be noted that sales in the second half of the year have a diminished impact on premium earnings, especially since over 80% of American Income Life's premiums come from policies that have been in force for greater than 1 year. That said, taking into account what we know today and the knowledge of our business, at the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate average agent count growth and sales growth at AIL for the full year to be in the low single digits and mid-single digits, respectively.\nWe acknowledge these are estimates and this agent count and sales growth could be higher or lower. The range of our earnings guidance contemplates a range of possibilities regarding sales and agent count growth. including reasonably severe scenarios. Due to the significant growth in the first quarter, our sales guidance does assume a moderation of sales for the remainder of the year.\nI will now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less only required interest, was $44 million, up $15 million from the year-ago quarter. Net investment income was $283 million, up 10% or $25 million from the year-ago quarter. The increase is due to the continued strong growth in average invested assets.\nHigher interest rates across fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and short-term investments also contributed to the higher growth rate.\nRequired interest is up 4.8% over the year-ago quarter, same as the increase in average policy liability. For the full year, we expect net investment income to grow between 7% and 9% due to the combination of the favorable interest rate environment and steady growth in our invested assets, especially related to our CMLs and limited partnership investments.\nIn addition, at the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate required interest will grow between 5% and 5.5% for the year, resulting in growth in excess investment income of approximately 25% to 30%.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $682 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. This amount was higher than expected to take advantage of opportunities in the market. We invested at an average yield of 5.86%, an average rating of A-, and an average life of 32 years. We also invested approximately $126 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics at an average expected return of 10%.\nNone of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involve office properties. These investments are expected to produce additional cash yield over our fixed maturity investments and they are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.24%, up 6 basis points from the first quarter of 2023 and up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter. As of March 31, the tax equivalent effective yield rate on the fixed maturity portfolio was 5.25%, Including the cash yield from our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership, the first quarter earned yield was 5.46%.\nInvested assets are $21.4 billion, including $19.5 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $19 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.\nOn fixed maturity -- investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.4 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield of our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position as this is mostly interest rate driven and currently relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.\nBonds rated BBB comprised 47% of the fixed maturity portfolio, compared to 51% from the year ago quarter. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, real estate equities, CLOs and other asset-backed securities held by our peers. We believe that the BBB securities we acquired generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nBelow investment grade bonds remained low at $542 million, compared to $596 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to total fixed maturities is 2.8%.\nAt the midpoint of our guidance, for the full year, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion to $1.2 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.6% to 5.8%, and approximately to $400 million to $500 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics, at an average expected cash return of 8% to 10%.\nAs we said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact to our future policy benefits since they are not intra-sensitive.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. First, let me spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. Parent began the year with liquid assets of $48 million and ended the quarter with liquid assets of approximately $66 million, slightly higher than the $50 million to $60 million that we had historically targeted.\nIn the first quarter, the company repurchased almost 128,000 shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of approximately $16 million at an average share price of $122.13. Thus, including shareholder dividend payments of $21 million for the quarter, the company returned approximately $37 million to shareholders during the first quarter of 2024.\nThe amount of share repurchases during the first quarter is lower than we had anticipated, solely due to the evaluation of a potential acquisition wherein we paused share repurchases until conclusion on the acquisition was reached. We have decided not to pursue the acquisition and, as such, intend to continue repurchases as soon as possible.\nIn addition to the liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company generated excess cash flows during the first quarter and will continue to do so for the remainder of 2024. Parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $450 million to $470 million and is available to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases.\nExcess cash flows in 2024 are estimated to be higher than those in 2023, primarily due to higher statutory earnings in 2023 as compared to 2022. Including $66 million of available liquid assets at the end of the quarter, along with the $390 million to $410 million in excess cash flows we expect to generate during the remainder of 2024, the company has approximately $455 million to $475 million of liquid assets available to the parent for the remainder of 2024, of which we anticipate distributing approximately $65 million to $70 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments.\nAs mentioned on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. At this time, we believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other alternative investments -- over the alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of parent excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends.\nAt the midpoint of our earnings guidance, we anticipate approximately $350 million to $370 million of share repurchases for the year, with approximately 1/2 of that occurring in the second quarter and the remainder in the third and fourth quarters. That said, current market conditions, and should they remain favorable, we will clearly consider accelerating repurchases and may consider accelerating some portion of our anticipated 2025 excess cash flows into 2024.\nNow with respect to our capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support ratings -- [ current ] ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action-level RBC in the range of 300% to 320%. At the end of 2023, our consolidated RBC ratio was 314%. At this ratio, our subsidiaries had, at that time, approximately $85 million of capital over the amount needed to meet the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%.\nNow with regards to policy obligations for the current quarter. As we discussed on prior calls, we have included within the supplemental financial information available on our website an exhibit that details the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2023, we updated both our life and health assumptions, and there have been no changes to our long-term assumptions in the period since. No assumption updates were made in the first quarter of 2024, and we intend to update life and health assumptions in the third quarter of this year.\nIn addition to the impact of assumption changes, the remeasurement gain or loss also indicates experienced fluctuations. For the first quarter of 2024, life policy obligations were favorable when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency. The remeasurement gain related to experienced fluctuations resulted in $5 million of lower life policy obligations and $3 million of lower health policy obligations. As expected, life remeasurement gains were lower this quarter than in the first half of 2023 -- sorry, in the last half of 2023, which we believe is due in part to the seasonally high first quarter life claims versus the rest of the year.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the recent short-term trends and policy obligations experienced. The range of earnings guidance encompasses the possibility of future favorable remeasurement gains through 2024. The recent experience as well as our life mortality trends in the first half of 2024 will inform the third quarter 2024 update to our endemic mortality assumptions. As we noted on our last call, our endemic mortality assumptions currently assumes returning to mortality levels slightly above pre-pandemic levels over the next few years. Recent trends, if they should continue, they indicate a quicker recovery than our current assumptions.\nFinally, with respect to earnings guidance for 2024. For the full year 2024, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $11.50 to $12, representing 10.3% growth at the midpoint of our range. The $11.75 point midpoint is higher than our previous guidance and reflects recent and anticipated investment income results, in addition to a greater impact from the $350 million to $370 million of share repurchases in 2024 as discussed earlier.\nThose are my comments. I'll now return the call back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments, and we'll now open up the call for questions."

My name is Melissa, and I will be your operator for today's call. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Stephen Mota, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2022 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussions of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, net income was $275 million, or $2.88 per share compared to $242 million or $2.46 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $267 million, or $2.80 per share, an increase of 10% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through December 31 is 23.2%, and book value per share is $47.10. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity is 14.7%, and book value per share as of December 31 is $76.21, up 11% from a year ago.\nIn our life insurance operations, premium revenue for the fourth quarter increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $795 million. Life underwriting margin was $305 million, also up 4% from a year ago. In 2024, driven by strong premium growth in both our American Income and Liberty National divisions, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 4.5% and 5% at the midpoint of our guidance and life underwriting margin to grow between 7% and 7.5%. As a percent of premium, we anticipate life underwriting margin to be in the range of 38% to 40%.\nIn health insurance, premium grew 3% to $336 million, and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $97 million. In 2024, we expect health premium revenue to grow 7% to 8%. At the midpoint of our guidance for the full year 2024, we expect health underwriting margin to grow between 5% and 6%, and as a percent of premium, to be around 27% to 29%.\nAdministrative expenses were $77 million for the quarter, down 1% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in pension and other employee-related costs. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.8% compared to 7.2% from the year ago quarter. For the year, administrative expenses were 6.8% of premium compared to 6.9% a year ago. In 2024, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 7% of premium, higher than 2023 due primarily to continuing investments in technology as we modernize and transform how we operate. I will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the fourth quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $406 million, and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $183 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, net life sales were $76 million, up 9% from a year ago, primarily due to growth in agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 11,131, up 20% from a year ago. American Income has had sequential agent growth each quarter of 2023, but accelerated in the last half of the year to double-digit growth, which bodes well for sales growth in 2024. I am pleased to see the strong growth in agent count and sales as we continue to build momentum from the recruiting and agent retention initiatives put in place at the end of 2022.\nNow at Liberty National, life premiums were up 8% over the year ago quarter to $90 million, and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $31 million. The growth in life premium reflects the significant progress this agency has made over the past several years, going from no growth in life premiums in 2016 and just 2% annual growth through 2019 to where we are today. Net life sales grew 12% to $26 million, and net health sales were $9 million, up 9% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 3,387, which is up 15% from a year ago. Liberty continues to generate strong growth in both agent count and sales due in part to the new technology implemented over the past few years, which has provided more granular field activity feedback and allowed agents to track their sales activity and training progress.\nNow Family Heritage. At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $102 million, and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $36 million. Net health sales grew 12% to $25 million due to increased productivity and higher agent counts during 2023. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,368, which is up 3% from a year ago. For the full year 2023, the average producing agent count increased 10% from a year ago. Family Heritage will continue to focus on recruiting, with additional emphasis\n[Audio gap]\nwere flat compared to the year ago quarter at $247 million, while life underwriting margin declined 2% to $59 million due to increased acquisition costs.\nNet life sales were $26 million, which is down 16% from the year ago quarter, primarily due to declines in customer inquiries as we have reduced marketing spend on certain campaigns that did not meet our profit objectives. We continue to focus on maximizing the underwriting margin dollars on new sales by managing the rising advertising and distribution costs associated with acquiring this new business. In addition to generating new business at profitable margins, the direct-to-consumer channel provides critical support to our agency business through brand impressions and the generation of sales leads.\nOn to United American General Agency. Here, the health premiums were flat compared to the year ago quarter at $139 million. Health underwriting margin was $14 million, down approximately $3 million from the year ago quarter due to both higher policy obligations and acquisition costs. Net health sales were $28 million, which is up 40% over the year ago quarter due to strong activity both in the individual and group Medicare supplement businesses.\nProjections. Let me talk about where we are headed based on the trends that we are seeing and the experience with our business. We expect the average producing agent count trends for the full year 2024 to be as follows: at American Income Life, high single-digit growth; in Liberty National, low double-digit growth; at Family Heritage, low double-digit growth. Net life sales for the full year 2024 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, low double-digit growth; also at Liberty National, low double-digit growth; and direct-to-consumer, relatively flat.\nNet health sales for the full year 2024 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, low double-digit growth; also at Family Heritage, low double-digit growth; United American General Agency, low to mid-single-digit growth. Now before turning the call back over to Frank, I'd like to discuss 1 additional item. During 2023, an online publication posted articles related to litigation pending in arbitration against American Income Life and 1 of its state general agents. Although we generally do not comment on pending litigation and will not be taking any questions on the topic today, we'd like to provide the following limited statement.\nThis litigation relates to allegations made by former independent contractor sales agent with American Income. In 2021, prior to the litigation and as soon as American Income became aware of the agent's allegations, the company engaged an external third party to conduct an impartial and thorough investigation. American Income took prompt and appropriate action based on that investigation. We continue to vigorously dispute and defend against the allegations made about American Income Life in this litigation. And we do not believe the litigation will be material to Globe Life's overall results or American Income Life's agency operations. We take seriously any allegations brought to our attention concerning harassment, inappropriate conduct or unethical business practices, and we do not tolerate such behavior.\nAmerican Income Life provides numerous ways for sales agents to raise concerns, including contacting the company's agency department directly or utilizing an independent third-party reporting hotline. We have processes in place to address such concerns when we learn of them. We also provide mandatory anti-harassment and antidiscrimination training to agents and provide and ask agents to review the company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes information about how to report concerns. I want to emphasize that at Globe Life, we strive to act in accordance with the highest level of ethics and integrity at all levels of our organization. I'll now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We'll now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less only required interest, was $36 million, up $5 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $272 million, up 6% or $16 million from the year ago quarter. The increase is due primarily to growth in average invested assets, but also supplemented by the impact from higher interest rates across fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and short-term investments. Required interest is up nearly 5% over the year ago quarter, slightly higher than the 4.5% growth in average policy liabilities.\nFor the full year 2024, we expect net investment income to grow between 5% and 6% due to the combination of the favorable interest rate environment and steady growth in our invested assets. In addition, at the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate required interest will grow around 5% for the year, resulting in growth in excess investment income of approximately 10% to 12%.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $443 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 6.61%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 23 years. We also invested approximately $114 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics at an average expected cash return of 8%. None of our direct investments in commercial mortgage loans involved office properties. These investments are expected to produce additional cash yield over our fixed maturity investments, and they are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.23%, up 5 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 and up 4 basis points from the third quarter. As of December 31, the portfolio yield was also 5.23%.\nNow regarding our investment portfolio. Invested assets are $20.7 billion, including $18.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.4 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total fixed maturity portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.\nOur fixed maturity investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1 billion due to current market rates being higher than the average book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and is mostly interest rate-driven and currently relates entirely to bonds with maturities that extend beyond 10 years. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.\nBonds rated BBB comprised 48% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 51% from the year ago quarter. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, common equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities held by our peers. Additionally, unlike many other insurance companies, we do not have any exposure to direct real estate equity investments or private equities. We believe that the BBB securities we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nBelow investment-grade bonds remained low at $530 million compared to $542 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to total fixed maturities is 2.8%. At the midpoint of our guidance, for the full year 2024, we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.5% and approximately $440 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics and an average estimated cash yield of approximately 8.2%. As we said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment accounts with no impact to our future policy benefits since they are not interest sensitive. Now I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. First, let me spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $91 million and ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $48 million. In the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 660,000 shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of $77 million. The average share price for these repurchases was $117.02. For the full year, we purchased 3.4 million shares for a total cost of $380 million at an average share price of $112.84.\nIncluding shareholder dividend payments of $84 million, the company returned approximately $164 million to shareholders during 2023. In addition to liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company will generate excess cash flows during 2024. The parent company's excess cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $420 million to $460 million and is available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases.\nExcess cash flows in 2024 are estimated to be higher than those in 2023, primarily due to anticipated higher statutory earnings in 2023 as compared to 2022, thus providing higher dividends to the parent in 2024 than were received in 2023. The reason for this anticipated increase is due primarily to favorable life claims which are sufficient to offset approximately $50 million of realized losses in 2023. So using the $48 million of liquid assets plus the $420 million to $460 million of excess cash flows expected to be generated in 2024, we anticipate having approximately $470 million to $510 million of liquid assets available to the parent in 2024, of which we anticipate distributing approximately $85 million to $90 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments.\nAs mentioned on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other alternative -- other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to generate new sales, transform and modernize our information technology and other operational capabilities, as well as acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs. The remaining amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program in 2024.\nIn our earnings guidance, we estimate approximately $330 million to $370 million of share repurchases will occur during the year. With regards to the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries, our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. As discussed on previous calls, our consolidated RBC ratio was 321% at the end of 2022. For 2023, since our statutory financial statements are not yet finalized, our consolidated RBC ratio is not yet known. However, we anticipate the final 2023 RBC ratio will be slightly above the middle of our targeted range without any additional capital contributions being made.\nNow with regards to policy obligations for the current quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, we have included the historical operating summary under results under LDTI for each of the quarters in 2023 and 2022 within the supplemental financial information available on our website. In addition, we included an exhibit that details the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. As also noted on previous calls, life and health assumption changes were made in the third quarter of 2023. No assumption changes were made in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition to the impact of assumption changes, the remeasurement gain or loss also indicates experience fluctuations. For the fourth quarter, life policy obligations were favorable when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency. The remeasurement gain related to experience fluctuations resulted in $13 million of lower life policy obligations and $4 million of lower health policy obligations, primarily a result of favorable claims experience versus expected. For the full year, encompassing both assumption changes and experience-related fluctuations, the remeasurement gain for the Life segment resulted in $29 million of lower life policy obligations and $12 million of lower health policy obligations.\nThis is the second quarter in a row with life remeasurement gains greater than $10 million. We are encouraged by the short-term trend. And to the extent it continues, we would expect continued favorable remeasurement gains in 2024. The recent experience, as well as life mortality trends in the first half of 2024, will inform the third quarter 2024 update to our endemic mortality assumptions. Recall, our endemic mortality assumption currently assumes returning to mortality levels slightly above pre-pandemic levels over the next few years. Recent trends, if they should continue, may indicate a quicker recovery than our current assumption.\nSo finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2024. For the full year 2024, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $11.30 to $11.80, representing 8.5% growth at the midpoint of the range. The $11.55 midpoint is higher than our previous guidance and reflects recent favorable mortality trends continuing in '24. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments. We will now open up the call for questions."

Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Please note this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Stephen Mote, Senior Director, Investor Relations, to begin today's conference.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today, Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only.\nAccordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2022 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.

In the third quarter, net income was $257 million or $2.68 per share compared to $191 million or $1.94 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $260 million or $2.71 per share, an increase of 24% from a year ago. The strong growth in net income and net operating income is due in part to the remeasurement loss taken in the year ago quarter due to the unlocking of assumptions under LDTI.\nTom will discuss this further in his comments. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity through September 30 is 22.6% and book value per share is $48.51, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity is 14.7% and book value per share as of September 30 is $74.31, up 11% from a year ago. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $788 million. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 3.5% to 4%. Life underwriting margin was $300 million, up 21% from a year ago. The increase in life underwriting margin was due in part to a remeasurement gain recognized this quarter due to improved claims experience versus a remeasurement loss taken in the year ago quarter.\nAt the midpoint of our guidance, we expect life underwriting margin for the full year to grow a little over 5% and as a percent of premium to be approximately 38%. In health insurance, premium grew 3% to $331 million and health underwriting margin was down 4% to $97 million, due in part to a remeasurement gain recognized in the third quarter of 2022 that was greater than what was recognized in the current quarter. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow around 3%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect health underwriting margin to be relatively flat and as a percent of premium to be around 29%.\nAdministrative expenses were $75 million for the quarter, down 1% from a year ago, primarily due to a decrease in pension and other employee-related costs. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 7% a year ago. For the full year 2023, we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 6.8% of premium, in line with our previous expectations.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the third quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. First, I'm going to start with American Income Life Here, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $400 million and the life underwriting margin was up 8% to $181 million. In the third quarter of 2023, net life sales were $81 million, which is up 6% from the year ago quarter, primarily due to growth in agent count.\nThe average producing agent count for the third quarter was 10,993, up 16% from the year ago quarter and up 5% from the second quarter. I am encouraged to see the growth in agent count and sales. We are seeing positive results from the recruiting and sales initiatives put in place at the end of last year. At Liberty National, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $88 million and life underwriting margin was up 39% to $27 million. Net life sales increased 31% to $24 million and net health sales were $9 million, which is up 19% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increase in agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 3,339, up 20% from the year ago quarter.\nLiberty continues to generate positive momentum through strong recruiting and agency leadership growth. Ongoing implementation of new technology over the past few years has enabled agency leadership to more effectively monitor and manage agent activity. Now Family Heritage. Here, the health premiums increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $100 million, while the health underwriting margin declined 3% to $36 million. Net health sales were up 15% to $25 million due to increased agent count and productivity.\nThe average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,323, up 7% from the year ago quarter. Moving forward, this agency will continue to focus on recruiting with additional initiatives to incentivize agency middle management growth, which will lead to growth in new offices and agent count. In our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums increased 1% over the year ago quarter to $248 million, and life underwriting margin increased 86% to $63 million due to lower policy obligations. Net life sales were $26 million down 8% from the year ago quarter, primarily due to declines in direct mail and insert media activity\nWhile we will continue our efforts to grow direct-to-consumer sales activity, our primary focus will be maximizing the underwriting margin dollars on new sales by managing the rising advertising and distribution costs associated with acquiring this new business. In addition to the ability to produce new business at a healthy margin, the direct-to-consumer division provides significant support in the form of brand impressions and sales leads to our agencies that is critical to the strong growth they're seeing.\nAt United American General Agency, here, the health premiums increased 2% over the year ago quarter to $137 million. Health underwriting margin of $15 million or 11% of premium is flat from the year ago quarter. Net health sales were $16 million, up 20% over the year ago quarter due to a 6% increase in individual Medicare supplement sales and increased activity at Globe Life benefits.\nOn to projections, now based on the trends that we are seeing and our experience with our business, we expect that average producing agent count trends for the full year 2023 to be as follows: at American Income Life, an increase of around 12% at Liberty National, an increase of around 18% at Family Heritage, an increase of around 11%.\nNet life sales for the full year 2023 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, we anticipate approximately 15% growth in the fourth quarter which will result in full year growth of approximately 4%. Liberty National, an increase of around 23% and direct to consumer, a decrease of around 5%. Net health sales for the full year 2023 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of around 17%, Family Heritage, an increase of around 18% and United American General Agency, an increase of around 20%.\nNow for 2024, at the midpoint of our 2024 guidance, we expect sales growth for the full year of 2024 to be as follows: for life sales, American income, high single digit; Liberty National mid-teens growth and direct-to-consumer relatively flat as we continue to focus on profitability. For health sales, we expect Liberty National to have mid-teens growth; Family Heritage, low double-digit growth, and United American General Agency, low single-digit growth\nI'll now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest was $34 million, up from $10 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $267 million, up 8% or $20 million from the year ago quarter due to higher yield on fixed maturities and short-term investments and an increase in floating interest rates on our commercial mortgage loans, including those held in limited partnerships.\nRequired interest is up 5% over the year ago quarter, in line with the increase in net policy liabilities. For the full year, we expect net investment income to grow approximately 7% due to the combination of the favorable rate environment and steady growth in our invested assets and expect excess investment income to grow approximately $25 million.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $427 million in investment-grade maturities primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 6.15%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 27 years, taking advantage of opportunities in the municipal sector to obtain higher yield as well as higher quality. We also invested approximately $100 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.19%, up 2 basis points from the third quarter of 2022 and up 1 basis point from the second quarter.\nAs of September 30, the portfolio yield was 5.23%. Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $20.7 billion, including $18.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $18.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. As a reminder, we have information on our website regarding our banking and commercial loan investments.\nOur fixed maturity investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss position of approximately $2.6 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and is mostly interest rate driven. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Bonds rated BBB are 48% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 52% from the year-ago quarter. While this ratio was the lowest it has been in over 10 years, it is high relative to our peers. However, keep in mind that we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, common equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities held by our peers.\nAdditionally, unlike many other insurance companies, we do not have any exposure to direct real estate investments or private equities. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire generally provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Below investment-grade bonds are $493 million compared to $543 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to total fixed maturities is only 2.6%. At the midpoint of our guidance for the full year 2023, we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.9% and approximately $310 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics, at an average yield of approximately 8.3%. Also at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect the average yield earned on the fixed maturity portfolio to be around 5.19% for the full year 2023 and slightly higher at approximately 5.23% for the full year 2024.\nWe expect -- with respect to our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships, we anticipate the yield impacting net investment income to be in the range of 7.1% to 7.2% for both 2023 and 2024. As we've said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact to our future policy benefits. Since they are not interest sensitive.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. First, let me spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $91 million and ended the third quarter with liquid assets of approximately $69 million.\nIn the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 755,000 shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of $84 million. The average share price for these repurchases was $111.52. To date, the fourth quarter, we have purchased 165,000 shares for a total cost of $18 million at an average share price of $108.36 resulting in repurchases year-to-date of 2.9 million shares for a total cost of $321 million at an average share price of $111.63.\nIn addition to the liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company generated excess cash flows during the third quarter and will continue to do so for the remainder of 2023. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $425 million and available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases. As previously noted, we had approximately $69 million of liquid assets at the end of the quarter, slightly above the $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets we have historically targeted. In addition to the $69 million of liquid assets, we expect to generate $35 million to $40 million of excess cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2023, providing us with approximately $90 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of 2023 after taking into consideration the approximately $18 million of share repurchases to date in the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate distributing approximately $21 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments for the remainder of 2023. As mentioned on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations and after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to generate new sales, expand and modernize our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs.\nThe remaining amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program for 2023. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate approximately $465 million will be returned to shareholders in 2023, including approximately $380 million through share repurchases. Now with regards to capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. As discussed on previous calls, our consolidated RBC ratio was 321% at the end of 2022.\nIn light of credit losses incurred to date, we anticipate our overall year-end RBC ratio to be at the midpoint of our range or approximately 310%. At this point, we do not anticipate any significant credit losses or downgrades for the remainder of the year. But to the extent any do occur, we are well positioned to address any capital needed by our insurance subsidiaries to maintain RBC levels at the midpoint of our range. Now with regards to policy obligations for the current quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we have included the historical operating summary results under LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022 with -- within the supplemental financial information available on our website.\nIn addition, we included an exhibit that details the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. The total remeasurement gain of $19 million for the quarter reflects both current period fluctuations in experience from expected and the impact of assumption changes made in the quarter. Also, as noted on prior calls, life and health assumption changes were made in the third quarter of 2022 with an expectation of higher mortality in the Life segment and more favorable claim trends in the health segment.\nIn the third quarter of '23, we again updated those -- both our life and health assumptions, lapse, mortality and morbidity. And as we expected, the overall impact on third quarter results was not significant with a combined decrease in total life and health obligations of approximately $3 million. The life assumption changes increased life obligations by approximately $2 million in the quarter, while health assumption changes decreased health obligations by approximately $5 million\nIn addition to the assumption changes, the remeasurement gain or loss also indicates experience fluctuations. For the third quarter, life policy obligations were favorable when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency. The remeasurement gain related to experience fluctuations for the Life segment resulted in $13 million of lower life policy obligations and $3 million of lower health policy obligations, primarily as a result of favorable claim experience versus expected. Now with regards to earnings guidance for 2023, we are projecting net operating income per diluted share will be in the range of $10.49 to $10.65 and for the year ending December 31, 2023. The $10.50 midpoint of our guidance is $0.10 higher than what we had indicated last quarter, largely due to favorable policy obligations in the third quarter.\nOur guidance anticipated -- our guidance anticipates the continuation of recent favorable short-term trends, although at a lower level than the third quarter. For the full year 2023, we anticipate life underwriting margins to be approximately 38% of premium and helped underwriting margins to be approximately 29% of premium. Total acquisition cost, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs as well as nondeferred acquisition costs and commissions are expected to be 21% of premium, which is consistent with the third quarter.\nNow with regards to '24 guidance, for the full year 2024, we estimate net operating earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $11 to $11.60, representing 7% growth at the midpoint of the range. We anticipate life and health underwriting income to grow consistent with premium growth with Life and health underwriting margins as a percentage of premium to fall within the same ranges as '23 or about 39% for life and 28% to 30% for health. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate life premiums growing at approximately 5% and and health premiums growing at around 7%.\nIn addition, higher interest rates are expected to favorably impact excess investment income as we anticipate it to increase 7% to 9% at the midpoint of our guidance. Although 2023 results are not final for the year, at this time, we anticipate parent excess cash flows available to return to shareholders in 2024 will be a little over $400 million, slightly lower than '23 due in part to the impact of 2023 statutory income and realized losses and the cost of agency sales growth offsetting the benefits from favorable mortality trends and higher investment yields.\nFinally, let me comment on the merger announcement of Every Health. Earlier in the month, we announced entering into a merger agreement with Every Health, a small regional health care company locally focused in the major urban areas of Texas. Every is a start-up with a technology focus to provide outstanding customer experience and results in positive health outcomes. We previously had made a small investment in Every and recently had the opportunity to acquire the whole company. We believe full ownership will allow Every to grow, but more importantly, allow us to directly assess how we can utilize Every's technology to enhance Globe's customer experience and service offerings. We do not expect Every to have a significant impact on 2023 or 2024 results.\nThose are my comments. I'll now turn it back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments, and we will now open up the call for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to Stephen Mota, Senior Director, Investor Relations.\n\nKenneth S. Lee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release 2022 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, net income was $215 million or $2.24 per share compared to $224 million or $2.26 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $251 million or $2.61 per share, an increase of 3% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 22.4%, and book value per share is $41.44. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share of $72.09, up 10% from a year ago. .\nIn our life insurance operations, premium revenue for the second quarter increased 3% from the year ago quarter to $782 million. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 4%. Life underwriting margin was $296 million in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect life underwriting margin for the full year to grow around 5% and as a percent of premium to be in the range of 37% to 39%. In health insurance, premium grew 3% to $329 million, and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $92 million. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow around 3%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect health underwriting margin to be relatively flat and as a percent of premium to be in the range of 28% to 30%.\nAdministrative expenses were $75 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.8%, same as the year ago quarter. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up approximately 3% and and be around 6.9% of premium. Higher labor and IT costs are expected to be largely offset by a decline in pension-related employee benefit costs.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the second quarter marketing operations.\n\nUnknown Analyst\n\nThank you, Frank. First, American Income Life, where life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $395 million, and life underwriting margin was up 2% to $180 million. In the second quarter of 2023, net life sales were $82 million, down 4% from a year ago quarter. However, as a reminder, we produced very strong sales in the first half of 2022 and with AIL posting sales growth of 16% for the second quarter of 2022. This makes for a tough quarter-over-quarter comparable. However, I see good momentum with this division, and I anticipate strong sales growth in the latter half of this year. The average producing count for the second quarter was $10,488, up 8% from the year ago quarter and up 8% from the first quarter. While sales declined from the year ago quarter, we have seen sequential growth in average producing agent count over the past 2 quarters, and I am excited to see the continued momentum in recruiting as agent count growth is a driver of future sales growth. .\nAt Liberty National, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $87 million, and life underwriting margin was up 2% to $28 million. Net life sales increased 21% to $23 million, and net health sales were up $8 million, which is up 18% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 3,180, which is up 17% from the year ago quarter. Liberty National continues to produce strong sales and recruiting activities. At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $98 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $33 million.\nThe increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to higher premiums and improved claim experience. Net health sales were up 19% to $23 million, primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,345, up 15% from the year ago quarter. The ongoing emphasis on recruiting continues to generate strong growth in this division.\nIn our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums increased 1% over the year ago quarter to $249 million while life underwriting margin declined 8% to $56 million. The decrease in underwriting margin is primarily due to higher policy obligations and acquisition expenses. Net life sales were $32 million, down 3% from the year ago quarter, primarily due to declines in direct mail and insert media activity. However, electronic sales grew over 4% from the year ago quarter. Electronic sales continue to be an important part of our direct-to-consumer division as the electronic channel currently represents approximately 70% of new sales. And this channel has grown at an approximate 6% compounded annual growth rate since 2019.\nOn to United American General Agency, where health premiums increased 1% over the year ago quarter to $137 million. Health underwriting margin was $15 million or 11% of premium down from 12% from the year ago quarter. Net health sales were $13 million, up 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Now on to projections. Based on the trends that we are seeing in our experience with our business, we expect the average producing agent count trends for the full year 2023 to be as follows: at American Income Life, low double-digit growth at Liberty National mid-teens growth at Family Heritage, low double-digit growth. Net life sales for the full year 2023 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, low single-digit growth; Liberty National, mid-teens growth direct-to-consumer slightly down to relatively flat. Net health sales for the full year 2023 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, mid-teens growth family heritage, low double-digit growth and United American General Agency, mid-single-digit growth. I'll now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which for 2023, we define as net investment income less only required interest on policy liabilities was $31 million, up $7 million from the year ago quarter. Net investment income was $261 million, up 7% or $16 million from the year ago quarter due to higher yield on fixed maturities and short-term investments. and an increase in floating interest rates on our commercial mortgage loans, including hotel and limited partnerships. I would point out here that while we benefit from the higher floating rates on the commercial loans, these investments do have rate floors that mitigate the impact of a decline in rates. Required interest as adjusted to reflect the impact from the adoption of LDTI, is up 4% over the year ago quarter. in line with the increase in net policy liabilities. For the full year, we expect net investment income to grow approximately 6% as a result of the favorable rate environment and steady growth in our invested assets. and expect excess investment income to grow in the range of $11 million to $12 million.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $359 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.75% and an average rating of AA- and an average life of 24 years, taking advantage of opportunities in the municipal sector to obtain higher yield as well as higher quality. We also invested $39 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yields and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.18%, and up 2 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and flat from the first quarter. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.21%. We -- now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $20.3 billion, including $18.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, 18.1 billion are investment grade with an average rating of B-. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. As a reminder, we have information on our website regarding our banking and commercial mortgage loan investments. As we mentioned previously during our first quarter earnings call, we took a $30 million after-tax provision for credit loss early in the second quarter as a result of the default of First Republic Bank. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.6 billion due to current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and it is primarily interest rate driven. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.\nBonds rated BBB are 49% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 53% from the year ago quarter. This is the lowest this ratio has been in over 10 years. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, keep in mind that we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives common equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Additionally, unlike many other insurance companies, we do not have any exposure to direct real estate equity investments or private equities. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Low investment-grade bonds are $496 million compared to $585 million a year ago.\nThe percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 2.7%. This is as low as this ratio has been in more than 20 years. In addition, below investment-grade bonds plus bonds rated BBB are 52% of fixed maturities, the lowest ratio it has been in over 15 years. Overall, we believe we are well positioned not only to stand a market downturn, but also to be opportunistic and purchase higher-yielding securities in such a scenario. Because we primarily invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles. We have performed stress tests under multiple scenarios on both our fixed maturity portfolio and our commercial mortgages held directly and through limited partnerships. Tom will address the potential capital implications of these stress tests in his comments. At the midpoint of our guidance, for the full year, we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.7% and at approximately $325 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics and an average yield of 7.5% to 8.5%. As we've said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact to our future policy benefits since they are not intrasensitive.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, [indiscernible]. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repo program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $91 million and ended the second quarter with liquid assets of approximately $74 million. In the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 780,000 shares of Global Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of $84 million. The average share price for these repurchases was $17.26. And to date, in the third quarter, we've purchased 133,000 shares for a total cost of $15 million at an average share price of $111.1 and resulting in repurchases year-to-date of 2.1 million shares for a total cost of $234 million at an average share price of $111.88. In addition to the liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company generated excess cash flows during the second quarter and will continue to do so through the second half of 2023. [indiscernible] company's excess cash flow, as we define it, primarily results from dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $420 million to $440 million and will be available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends through share repurchases. As noted in previous calls, this amount is higher than 2022. As previously noted, we had approximately $74 million of liquid assets at the end of the quarter as compared to the $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets we have historically targeted. In addition to the $74 million of liquid assets, we expect to generate $140 million to $160 million of excess cash flows for the second half of 2023, providing us with approximately $200 million to $220 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of 2023, and this is after taking into consideration the approximately $15 million of share repurchases to date in the third quarter. We anticipate distributing approximately $40 million to $45 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments for the remainder of 2023. As noted in previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends.\nIt should be noted that cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to generate new sales expand and modernize our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund future cash needs. The remaining amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program in 2023. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $370 million and $390 million of share repurchases will occur during the year. With regard to capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At the end of 2022, our consolidated RBC ratio was 321%. At this RBC ratio, our subsidiaries had at that time, approximately $125 million of capital over the amount required to meet the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. When adjusted for credit losses on fixed maturities incurred in the first half of the year, the RBC ratio has reduced slightly below the midpoint of our targeted RBC range of 300% to 320%. We are well positioned to address any additional capital needed by our insurance subsidiaries due to potential downgrades and additional defaults that may occur due to the recession or other economic factors. As Frank mentioned, we routinely performed stress tests on our investment portfolio under multiple scenarios. Under these stress tests, we anticipate various levels of downgrades and defaults in our fixed maturity portfolio, and included a provision for losses in our CML portfolio that reflect loss ratios in excess of those of the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. Under our scenarios, we do not anticipate that all of the downgrades defaults and losses in our investment portfolio would occur in 2023, but rather anticipate they would emerge over an extended period of time, which could be as long as 24 months.\nEven if these losses under our internal stresses occurred before the end of the year, we estimate only $25 million to $50 million of additional capital would be needed to maintain the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. The parent company has sufficient resources of liquidity and to fund this capital if it is needed to maintain our consolidated RBC ratio within our target range while continuing our dividend and share repurchase program as planned. With regards to policy obligations in the second quarter, as we've discussed on prior calls, we have included the historical operating summer results under LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022 and within the supplemental financial information available on our website. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated both our life and health assumptions, lapse, mortality and morbidity the life assumption updates reflected our current estimates of continued excess mortality, particularly in the near term. For the second quarter, life obligations were slightly favorable when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency. This resulted in a life remeasurement gain for the quarter. The supplemental financial information available on our website provides an exhibit, which shows the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. The remeasurement gain or loss shows the current period fluctuations in experience from those expected and the impact of assumption changes, if any, which are allocated to the current quarter and past periods. In the absence of assumption changes, the remeasurement gain or loss is indicative of experience fluctuations. The remeasurement gain for the Life segment resulted in $24 million lower life policy obligations and $2.6 million lower health policy obligations.\n\nMichael Clay Majors\n\nExecutive Vice President-Administration & Investor Relations, Globe Life, Inc.\n\n$2.4 million.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nSorry, $2.4 million lower life policy obligations and $2.6 million lower health policy obligations on slightly lower claims than anticipated. And in the second quarter, we had no changes to long-term assumptions. We are currently in the process of finalizing our review of long-term assumptions, and we'll make updates if needed in the third quarter. We do not expect these updates to be significant overall. Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2023. We -- we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $10.37 to $10.57 per diluted common share for the year ending December 31, 2023. The $10.47 midpoint of our guidance is higher than what we had indicated last quarter and is largely due to higher investment income from our commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments. For the full year 2023, we anticipate life underwriting margins to be in the range of 37% to 39%, slightly higher than the 2022 life underwriting margin percentage when restated for the full year. Life underwriting margins helped underwriting margins to be in the range of 28% to 30%. The Life and Health anticipated underwriting margins are unchanged from last quarter's guidance. We believe the year-to-date obligation ratios are indicative of emerging policy obligations over the remainder of the year. As previously noted, we will be reviewing assumptions and anticipate making updates next quarter Again, we do not expect these updates to be significant overall. Total acquisition costs in the second quarter as a percent of premium are 21%, including both amortization and nondeferred acquisition costs and commissions. We expect the full year to be consistent with this 21%. Those are my comments. I will now turn it over to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments, and we will now open the call up for questions. ."

And good morning, everyone. I would note here that our reported results for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 and reflect the adoption on January 1, 2023 of the new LDTI accounting guidance. First, I want to thank the many members of our accounting, actuarial, investment and technology teams for getting us ready to adopt this new accounting guidance this quarter. It was a substantial project, and they did a fantastic job. Tom will discuss the new guidance in more detail in his comments.\nIn the first quarter, net income was $224 million or $2.28 per share compared to $237 million or $2.37 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $248 million or $2.53 per share, an increase of 4% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 22.9% and book value per share is $39.74, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share is $70.34, up 10% from a year ago.\nIn Life Insurance Operations, premium revenue for the first quarter increased 3% from the year ago quarter to $773 million. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 4%. Life underwriting margin was $291 million, up 1% from a year ago. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect life underwriting margin as a percent of premium to be in the range of 37% to 39%. As we've discussed on prior calls, underwriting margin is different under the new LDTI accounting rules.\nIn Health Insurance, premium grew 2% to $322 million, and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $91 million. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow around 3%, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect health underwriting margin as a percent of premium to be in the range of 28% to 30%. Administrative expenses were $74 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.8% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up between 2% and 3% and be around 6.9% of premium due primarily to higher IT and information security costs.\nHigher labor and other costs are expected to be offset by a decline in pension related employee benefit costs.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the first quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $388 million, and life underwriting margin was up 2% to $176 million. In the first quarter of 2023, net life sales were $83 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter, while first quarter sales declined slightly from a year ago they grew 19% from the fourth quarter of last year. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 9,714, up 4% from the year ago quarter and up 5% and from the fourth quarter and is consistent with our expectations discussed on the last call. I'm very encouraged with the sales and agent count trends and see a lot of positive momentum in this division.\nAt Liberty National, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $85 million, and life underwriting margin was up 3% to $28 million. Net life sales increased 27% to $22 million, and net health sales were $7 million, up 14% and from the year ago quarter due to increased agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 3,011 up 13% from a year ago quarter. I'm very pleased with the results here as Liberty continues to successfully generate strong sales and recruiting activity.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% over the year ago quarter to $96 million, and health underwriting margin increased 15% to $32 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to higher premiums and improved claim experience. Net health sales were up 21% to $23 million, primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,298, up 18% from the year ago quarter. As we've mentioned previously, this agency has shifted focus over the last several quarters to recruiting and middle management development.\nNow in our direct-to-consumer division, life premiums increased 1% over the year ago quarter to $248 million, but life underwriting margin declined 3% to $56 million. The decrease in underwriting margin is primarily due to an increase in lead-related nondeferred acquisition expenses. Net life sales were $32 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter. As we have mentioned on previous calls, direct-to-consumer marketing is one facet of our business that has been impacted by the current inflationary environment. We've had to pull back somewhat on circulation and mailings as increases in postage and paper costs impeded our ability to achieve satisfactory return on our investment for specific marketing campaigns. There is an offset to this as we continue to generate more Internet activity, which has lower acquisition costs than our direct mail marketing.\nIn fact, electronic sales have grown at a 5.8% compounded annual growth rate since 2019 and are currently approximately 70% of our new business.\nOn to United American General Agency. Here, the health premiums increased 1% over the year ago quarter to $133 million, and health underwriting margin of $13 million, which is 10% of premium, is consistent with the year ago quarter. Net health sales were $15 million, up 13% in the year ago quarter. The increase in net health sales is primarily due to the sales growth at Globe Life Benefits.\nProjections. Now I want to talk about based on the trends that we are seeing and the experience with our business, we expect that average producing agent count trends for 2023 to be as follows: at American Income Life, low double-digit growth; at Liberty National low double-digit growth; and Family Heritage, low double-digit growth. Are very nice -- I'm pleased to project that all 3 of our exclusive agencies are going to have low double-digit growth through the remainder of the year.\nNet life sales for the full year 2023 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, low single-digit growth; Liberty National, low double-digit growth and direct-to-consumer slightly down to relatively flat for the full year. Net health sales for the full year of 2023 are expected to be as follows: at Liberty National, low double-digit growth; Family Heritage, low double-digit growth, and at United American General Agency, mid-single-digit growth.\nI will now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We'll now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which for 2023, we define as net investment income less only required interest was $29 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 15%. Net investment income was $257 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter. Acquired interest as adjusted to reflect the impact of the adoption of LDTI, is up 4% over the year ago quarter, in line with the increase in net policy liabilities. For the full year, we expect net investment income to grow approximately 5% as a result of the favorable rate environment and steady growth in our invested assets. And excess investment income to grow between 10% and 12%.\nNow regarding our investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $311 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.84% and an average rating of A and an average life of 25 years. We also invested $45 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. I will further discuss our commercial mortgage loans momentarily.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.18%, up 3 basis points from the first quarter of 2022 and flat versus the fourth quarter. As of March 31, the portfolio yield with 5.20%. Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets of $20.2 billion including $18.5 billion of $6 million -- of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $17.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.\nI would like to make a few comments regarding our banking and commercial mortgage loan investments. Total bank investments are 7% of our fixed maturity portfolio. We realized an after-tax loss of roughly $21 million during the first quarter on Signature Bank bonds. We also hold $39 million of First Republic bank bonds, which have been impaired in the second quarter due to recent developments. We did not have any exposure to the Silicon Valley Bank or the Credit Suisse AT1 bonds that defaulted.\nRegarding our commercial mortgage loans. We have $204 million net book value of CMLs directly held on our balance sheet, which is 1% of our total investment portfolio. We also have $454 million of limited partnership funds or 2.4% of the total investment portfolio that invest in CML. These limited partnerships are carried at fair value, which is updated quarterly and managed by [ PIMCO ] and MetLife. The CMLs we hold directly and most of our limited partnership CML investments our transitional or bridge loans that generally have a floating rate, 3-year maturities and 2 optional 1-year extensions if certain criteria are met. We prefer the risk return profile of these types of loans over traditional commercial mortgage loans and believe they provide good diversification away from corporate securities.\nTransitional or bridge loans are typically used to renovate or otherwise improve a particular property. For loans that are on our balance sheet, oftentimes, the appraised value is reflected in our regulatory filings reflect the original as-is appraisal at the time the transitional mode was initiated, which does not take into account any increases in value after the renovations are completed. The loan-to-value method we consider in evaluating the property, what we call stabilized appraised value is the basis we use in the supplemental information we provided on our website and reflects appraisals that take into consideration the effect of such renovations are expected to have on the property's value using market comps and other standard appraisal techniques at the time of the loan -- of loan origination.\nThus, the stabilized appraised values are typically higher than the original appraised values reflected in the regulatory filings. With respect to the CML tell directly on our balance sheet, $150 million of gross book value were originated prior to 2022. We have $59 million of loans with maturities in 2023 of which $22 million have optional extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain criteria of the loans with maturities in 2023, only $8 million are related to office properties, plus $2 million related to the pro rata office portion of mixed-use properties. The average loan-to-value ratio of the 2023 maturities is 64% with none greater than 90%. Our expected lifetime losses for our CML portfolio, which is equivalent to our CML CECL allowance is $3.1 million or 1.5% of book value.\nBased on both the underlying structure of our direct and indirect CML investments and the specific properties involved, we believe that the incremental risk inherent in these investments is more than offset by the additional yield they generate. As mentioned in our earnings release, we have provided additional information regarding our banking and CML investments on our Investor Relations website under Financial Reports and other financial information. These investments have been included in our portfolio stress testing that Tom will discuss in his comments.\nOur fixed maturity investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.3 billion due to the current market rates being higher than the book yield on our holdings. As we have historically noted, we are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and is mostly interest rate-driven. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Bonds rated BBB are 51% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 55% from the year ago quarter. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, keep in mind that we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, common equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities.\nAdditionally, unlike many other insurance companies, we do not have any exposure to direct real estate equity investments or private equities. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Below investment-grade bonds are $596 million compared to $583 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3.2%, still near historical lows.\nIn addition, below investment-grade bonds plus bonds rated BBB are 54% of fixed maturities, the lowest ratio it has been in over 8 years. Finally, the amount of our fixed maturity portfolio subject to either negative outlook or negative watch by the rating agencies is at the lowest level since 2010.\nOverall, we believe we are well positioned not only to a stand to market downturn, but also to be opportunistic and purchase higher-yielding securities in such a scenario. Because we primarily invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles. We have performed stress tests under multiple scenarios on both our fixed and maturity portfolio and our commercial mortgages held directly and through limited partnerships. As previously noted, Tom will address the potential capital implications of these stress tests in his comments. At the midpoint of our guidance for the full year, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of approximately 5.6% and approximately $250 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics at an average yield of 7% to 8%.\nAs we've said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact to our future policy benefits since they are not interest sensitive.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital, liquidity and LDTI.\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. Parent began the year with liquid assets of $91 million. In the first quarter, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock for a total cost of $135 million which includes the acceleration of approximately $35 million of our annual repurchase plan to take advantage of recent lower share prices. The average share price for these purchases was $115.04, and we ended the first quarter with liquid assets of approximately $77 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 1.4 million shares of Global Life Inc's common stock for a total cost of $158 million at an average share price of $114.04.\nIn addition to the liquid assets held by the parent, the parent company generated excess cash flows during the first quarter and will continue to do so throughout 2023. Parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the Parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt. We anticipate the Parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $420 million to $440 million and is available to return to its shareholders in the form of dividends and through share repurchases. This amount is higher than 2022, primarily due to the lower life losses incurred in '22, which resulted in higher statutory income in 2022 as compared to 2021, thus providing higher dividends to the Parent in 2023 that were received in 2022.\nAs previously noted, we had approximately $77 million of liquid assets at the end of the quarter as compared to $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets that we have historically targeted. In addition to the $57 million of liquid assets, we expect to generate $295 million to $315 million of the excess cash flows for the remainder of 2023 and providing us with approximately $350 million to $370 million of assets available to Parent for the remainder of 2023 after taking into consideration the approximately $23 million of share repurchases to date in the second quarter. We anticipate distributing approximately $60 million to $65 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments for the remainder of 2023.\nIn May, we have approximately $166 million of senior debt maturing. In April, the company closed on $170 million 18-month term loan, the proceeds of this term loan will be used to retire the 7.875% senior notes maturing on May 15, 2023. We want to continue to monitor debt markets and our capital needs. Our current plan is to issue new long-term debt long-term senior debt in 2024 to pay off the term loan, reduce other short-term debt and meet long-term capital needs.\nAs noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over the other alternative -- other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the Parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends. It should be noted that the cash received by the Parent from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand and modernize our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs. The remaining amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program in 2023. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $370 million and $390 million of share repurchases will occur during the year.\nWith regard to capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. Global Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At the end of 2022, our consolidated RBC ratio was 321% at this RBC ratio our subsidiaries had at that time, approximately $125 million of capital over the amount required to meet the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. When adjusted for first quarter realized losses of $24 million and anticipated $30 million after-tax loss related to the First Republic Bank, the RBC ratio is reduced approximately to 312% and is near the midpoint of our targeted RBC range of 300% to 320%.\nWe are well positioned to address any additional capital needed by our insurance subsidiaries due to potential downgrades and additional defaults that may occur due to a recession or other economic factors. As Frank mentioned, we routinely performed stress tests on our investment portfolio under multiple areas. Under these stress tests, we anticipate various levels of downgrades in the defaults in our fixed maturity portfolio and include a provision for losses in our CML portfolio that reflects loss rates in excess of those in the Fed's severely adverse scenario.\nUnder our scenarios, we do not anticipate that all the downgrades, defaults and losses in our CML portfolio would occur in 2023, but rather anticipate they would emerge over an extended period, which could be as long as 24 months. Even if the losses under our internal stress test occurred before the end of the year, we estimate only between $30 million to $55 million of additional capital would be needed to maintain the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. A parent has sufficient capital sources of liquidity to meet this capital if it is needed to maintain our consolidated RBC ratio within our target range while continuing our dividend and share repurchase program as planned.\nNow I'd like to provide a few comments related to policy obligations on the first quarter results. As we've talked about on prior calls, we have included in the supplemental financial information available on our website, historical operating sub results under LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022. In the third quarter of '22, we updated both our life and health assumptions. The life assumption updates reflect our current estimates of continued excess mortality particularly in the near term. For the first quarter, the life policy obligations showed slightly favorable fluctuations when compared to our assumptions of mortality and persistency. This resulted in a small life remeasurement game in the quarter. The supplemental financial information available on our website provides exhibits, which shows the remeasurement gain or loss by distribution channel. The remeasurement gain or loss shows the current period fluctuations in experience and the impact of assumption changes, if any, which are allocated to the current quarter as well as past periods.\nIn the absence of assumption changes is indicative of experienced fluctuations. The remeasurement gain for the Life segment was $2.7 million lower policy obligations, reflecting favorable fluctuations for the quarter while for the Health segment resulted in $2 million higher policy obligations, reflecting unfavorable fluctuations for the quarter. In the first quarter, we had no changes to long-term assumptions.\nFinally, with respect to our earnings guidance in 2023, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $10.28 to $10.52 per diluted common share for the year ending December 31, 2023. The 1040 midpoint of our guidance is higher than what we had indicated last quarter. The increase in our expectations for 2023 is largely due to the impact of lower share price and slightly higher life margins as a result of lower policy obligations than previously anticipated. Consistent with our guidance on the last call and Frank's comments, for the full year 2023, we anticipate life underwriting margins to be in the range of 37% to 39% and health underwriting margins to be in the range of 28% to 30%.\nGiven that our assumptions were recently updated, we believe first quarter obligation ratios are indicative of emerging policy obligations over the year. We will be reviewing assumptions and anticipate making updates in the third quarter each year. At this time, we do not believe that to be significant. Total acquisitions in the first quarter as a percent of premium is 21%, including both amortization and nondeferred acquisition costs and commissions, we expect the full year to be consistent with this 21%. While the new GAAP accounting changes were significant, it is important to keep in mind that the changes only impact the timing of when our future profits will be recognized and that none of the changes impact our premium rates, the amount of premiums we collect in the amount of claims we ultimately pay.\nFurthermore, it has no impact on our statutory earnings, the statutory capital we require to maintain for regulatory purposes or the parent company's excess cash flows nor will it cause us to make any changes in the products that we offer. Those are my comments.\nI'll now turn it back to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nLet's say, we're ready to open up the call for questions now."

My name is George. I'll be coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Stephen Mota, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen Mota\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Tom Kalmbach, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Majors, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only.\nAccordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2021 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nCo-CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Before getting started, I want to let you know that due to the ice storms in the DFW area, we are doing this call from multiple locations. So if there are any issues with connections, please bear with us. Then Matt and I would like to quickly take this opportunity to thank Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, once again and acknowledge their accomplishments as Globe Life's co-CEOs over the last 10 years, including 2022, another good year for Globe Life.\nNow to the results of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, net income was $212 million, or $2.14 per share compared to $178 million or $1.76 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $221 million or $2.24 per share, an increase of 32% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 12.3% and book value per share was $49.65.\nExcluding unrealized losses on fixed maturities, return on equity for the full year was 13.4% and book value per share as of December 31 was $64.01, up 9% from a year ago. It is encouraging that our return on equity, excluding unrealized gains and losses for the fourth quarter, was 14.3%, reflecting the lessening impact of excess life claims on our operations.\nIn the life insurance operations, premium revenue for the fourth quarter increased 3% from the year ago quarter to $754 million. For the full year 2022, premium income grew 4%. Growth in premium income was challenged due to the lower sales growth we've seen this year, primarily in our direct-to-consumer channel in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates on our Canadian premiums at American Income.\nIn 2023, we expect life premium to grow around 4%. Life underwriting margin was $212 million, up 45% from a year ago. The increase in margin is due primarily to improved client experience. With respect to anticipated underwriting income, as we've talked about on prior calls, underwriting margin will be calculated differently under the new LDTI accounting rules and is expected to be substantially higher due to the changes required by the new accounting standards.\nTom will discuss the expected impact of LDTI in his comments. In health insurance, premium grew 4% to $324 million, and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $82 million. For the full year 2022, premium grew 6%. In 2023, we expect health premium revenue to grow around 3%, lower than 2022 due to lower premium growth in our United American and General Agency operations.\nAdministrative expenses were $78 million for the quarter, up 12% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 7.2% compared to 6.7% a year ago. For the year, administrative expenses were 7% of premium compared to 6.6% a year ago.\n2023, we expect administrative expenses to be up approximately 3%, and be around 6.9% of premium due primarily to higher IT and information security costs. Higher labor costs are expected to be offset by a decline in pension-related employee benefit costs.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the fourth quarter marketing operations.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nCo-CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. First up is American Income Life. The American Income Life, life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $381 million, and Life underwriting margin was up 27% to $130 million. The higher underwriting margin is primarily due to improved claims experience and higher premium.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, net life sales were $70 million, down 6% from a year ago quarter. The decline in sales resulted from reduced agent count and agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 9,243, down 3% from the year ago quarter and down 2% from the third quarter.\nThe decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter is consistent with typical seasonal trends. The decline in average agent count from a year ago is due to higher-than-expected attrition throughout 2022, as we have previously discussed. While the agent count declined from a year ago, I am encouraged as we have seen positive recruiting momentum over the latter part of the fourth quarter into the beginning of this year. We've also started to have some success with our new retention efforts. I believe the agency compensation adjustments we have made to emphasize recruiting and retention will help continue this momentum.\nI am optimistic regarding the long-term growth potential of this agency division. At Liberty National, life premiums were up 4% over the year ago quarter to $82 million, and life underwriting margin was up 74% to $21 million. The increase in the underwriting margin is primarily due to improved claims experience.\nNet life sales increased 24% to $23 million, and net health sales were $9 million, up 14% from the year ago quarter due mainly to increased productivity and agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,946, up 8% from the year ago quarter and up 6% compared to the third quarter. Liberty continues to build on the momentum that's been generated over the past year and is well positioned for future growth.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% over the year ago quarter to $94 million, and health underwriting margin increased 2% to $26 million. Net health sales were up 21% to $22 million due to increased agent count and agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,334 up 12% from the year ago quarter and up 8% compared to the third quarter.\nAs we've discussed before, there was a shift in emphasis last year to recruiting and middle management development. This has paid off nicely as we continue to see positive trends at Family Heritage. In our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums were flat over the year ago quarter to $238 million but life underwriting margin increased from $12 million to $39 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved claims experience. Net life sales were $31 million down 9% from the year ago quarter due to declines in circulation and response rate. This sales decline is consistent with our expectations. As we have mentioned in previous calls, direct-to-consumer marketing is one facet of our business that has been impacted by the current inflationary environment.\nWe've had to pull back somewhat on circulation and mailings as increases in postage and paper costs impede our ability to achieve satisfactory return on our investment for specific marketing campaigns. There is an offset to this as we continue to generate more Internet activity, which has lower acquisition costs than our direct mail marketing.\nToday, electronics sales are approximately 70% of our business compared to 54% in 2019. I am also encouraged to see some resiliency here as the average premium per issued policy has increased each year for the last several years and was 16% higher in 2022 than in 2019. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% over the year ago quarter to $137 million and health underwriting margin increased 1% to $20 million.\nNet health sales were $20 million, down 25% compared to the year ago quarter, and this decline is due primarily to the market dynamics we saw throughout 2022, including aggressive pricing by competitors on certain Medicare Supplement products and a consumer movement to Medicare Advantage.\nProjections. Now based on the trends that we are seeing and our experience with our business, we expect the average producing agent count trends for 2023 to be as follows: American Income Life, high single-digit growth; Liberty National, low double-digit growth; Family Heritage, high single-digit growth. Net life sales trends for the full year 2023 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, relatively flat; Liberty National, high single-digit to low double-digit growth; direct-to-consumer, relatively flat.\nNet health sales trends for 2023 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, a high single digit to the low double-digit increase, Family Heritage, a high single-digit increase, United American General Agency, low single-digit growth. I will now turn the call back to Frank.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nCo-CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. We'll now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which for 2022, we defined as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $63 million, up 7% from the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 10%. Net investment income was $254 million, up 6% from the year ago quarter.\nOn a per share basis, net investment income was up 9%. With the adoption of LDTI in 2023, we will begin viewing excess investment income as net investment income less only required interest. For the full year 2023, we expect net investment income to grow approximately 5% as a result of the favorable rate environment. With respect to required interest, it will be substantially higher than reported in 2022 as a result of changes related to the adoption of LDTI.\nAs mentioned previously, Tom will further discuss LDTI in his comments. Now regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $239 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the financial, municipal and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 6.10%, an average rating of A and an average life of 21 years.\nWe also invested $104 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.18%, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter of 2021 and up 1 basis point from the third quarter.\nAs of December 31, the portfolio yield was 5.19% including $18.3 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. For the fixed maturities, $17.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.\nOur investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $1.8 billion due to the high -- higher current market rates on our holdings than book yields. We are not concerned by the unrealized loss position and it is mostly interest rate driven. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.\nBonds rated BBB are 51% of the fixed maturity portfolio, down from 54% from a year ago. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is relative -- high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nLow investment grade bonds are $542 million compared to $702 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3%. This is as low as this ratio had been for more than 20 years. In addition, below investment-grade bonds plus bond rate BBB or 54% of fixed maturities, the lowest ratio it has been in 8 years.\nOverall, we are comfortable with the quality of our portfolio because we primarily invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles.\nDuring 2022, we executed some repositioning of the fixed maturity portfolio to improve yield and quality. Over the course of last year, we sold approximately $359 million of fixed maturities with an average rating of BBB and reinvested the proceeds in higher-yielding securities with an average rating of A+. Overall, we believe we are well positioned not only to withstand a market downturn but also to be opportunistic and purchase higher-yielding securities in such a scenario.\nI would also mention that we have no direct investments in Ukraine or Russia and do not expect any material impact to our investments in multinational companies that have exposure to these countries. At the midpoint of our guidance for the full year 2023, we expect to invest approximately $940 million in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.5% and approximately $310 million in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics at an average cash yield of 7% to 8%.\nAs we've said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact on our future policy benefits since they are not interest sensitive.\nNow I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on capital, liquidity and LDTI. Tom?\n\nThomas Peter Kalmbach\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. So in the fourth quarter, the company purchased 490,000 shares of Global Life Inc. common stock $60 million of liquid assets we have historically targeted with the $91 million of liquid assets plus $410 million to $450 million of excess cash flows expected to be generated in 2023, we anticipate having $500 million to $540 million of assets available to the parent in 2023,of which we anticipate distributing approximately $80 million to $85 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of parent excess cash flow after the payment of shareholder dividends.\nIt should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand and modernization of our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs.\nThe remaining amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program for 2023. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $360 million and $400 million of share repurchases will occur during the year. Now with regard to capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support current ratings. Global Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%.\nFor 2022, since our statutory financial statements are not yet finalized, our consolidated RBC ratio is not yet known. However, we anticipate the final 2022 RBC ratio will be near the midpoint of this range without any additional capital contributions. As noted on the previous call, the new NAIC factors became effective in 2022 related to mortality risk, also known as C2. Given the consistent generation of strong statutory gains from insurance operations and given our product portfolio, these new factors will simply result in even stronger capital adequacy at our target RBC ratios.\nNow I'd like to provide you a few comments related to the impact of excess policy obligations on fourth quarter results. Overall, fourth quarter excess policy obligations were in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, the company incurred approximately $5 million of COVID life claims related to approximately 31,000 U.S. COVID deaths occurring in the quarter as reported by the CDC and was in line with expectations. We also incurred excess deaths as compared to those expected based on pre-pandemic levels from non-COVID causes, including deaths due to lung disorders, heart and circulatory issues and neurological disorders.\nWe believe the higher level of mortality we have seen is due in large part to the effects of the pandemic. So as the number of COVID deaths had moderated, so has the number of bets from other causes. In the fourth quarter, the impact of excess non-COVID policy -- life policy obligations were generally in line with our expectations at about $6 million.\nFor the full year, the company incurred approximately $49 million of COVID life policy obligations related to approximately 243,000 U.S. COVID deaths, an average of $2 billion per 10,000 U.S. deaths. In addition, we estimate non-COVID claims resulted in approximately $69 million of higher policy obligations for the full year. The $118 million combined impact of COVID and higher non-COVID policy obligations was around 4% of total life premium in 2022, down from approximately 6% in 2021.\nBased on the data we currently have available; we estimate incurring approximately $45 million of total excess life policy obligations from both COVID and non-COVID claims in 2023. We estimate that the total reported U.S. deaths from COVID will be approximately 105,000 at the midpoint of our guidance.\nFinally, with respect to earnings guidance for 2023. As noted on prior calls, the new accounting standard related to long-duration contracts is effective January 1, 2023. From this point forward, we report 2023 results and guidance under the new accounting requirements. I will do my best to bridge the gap as there are many changes with these new requirements.\nSo we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $10.20 to $10.50 per diluted common share for the year ending December 31, 2023. The $10.35 midpoint of our guidance is lower than what we had indicated last quarter when including the impact of LDTI adoption. The reduction is primarily due to a reduction in the expected impact from the adoption of LDTI as we get more information and have refined our assumptions and estimates impacting both 2022 and 2023.\nIn addition to the lower LDTI impact, we anticipate slightly lower premiums, higher customer need and agency expenses as well as higher financing costs, which are reflective of higher short-term yields than previously anticipated. We estimate the after-tax impact of implementing the new accounting standard resulted in an increase in 2023 net operating income in the range of $105 million to $115 million.\nWe are still in the process of determining the full 2022 results under the new standard once finalized, it could affect the 2022 -- 2023 estimated results. Going forward, fluctuations in experience and changes in assumptions will result in changes in both future policy obligations and the amortization of DAC as a percent of premium.\nThe largest driver of the increase is lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs, or DAC, than under the prior accounting standard due to the changes in the treatment of renewal commissions, the elimination of interest on DAC balances, the updating of certain assumptions and the methods of amortizing DAC. Due to the treatment of deferred renewal commissions on amortization in our captive agency channels, we do expect that acquisition costs as a percent of premium will increase slightly over the next few years. In addition to the changes affecting the amortization of DAC, the new accounting standard changes how policy obligations are determined under the new standard, Life policy up -- life policyholder benefits reported in 2021 and 2022 will be required to be restated to reflect the new requirements and will include the impact of unlocking and updating prior assumptions.\nFor 2023, absent any assumption changes, we expect the following impacts. Life obligations as a percent of premium will be in the range of 40.5% to 42.5%. This is consistent with the average life policy obligation ratio over the last 5 years. Health obligations as a percent of health premium will be in the range of 50% to 52%. This is about 3% to 4.5% lower than the average health policy obligation percentage over the last 5 years.\nFor the life and health lines combined, commissions, amortization and non-deferred acquisition costs as a percent of premium will be in the range of 20% to 21.5%, approximately 8% to 9.5% lower than the recent 5-year averages. The resulting life underwriting margin as a percent of premium are expected to be in the range of 37% to 38% and health underwriting margins as a percent of premium in the range of 28% to 29%.\nSo offsetting the increases in underwriting income will be a reduction to excess investment income to the elimination of interest accruals on DAC balances that historically have reduced net required interest. In 2022, interest on DAC balances was approximately $260 million. In 2023, this will be 0 under the new standards as compared to between $275 million and $285 million of interest accruals on DAC under historical GAAP and that we would have anticipated.\nIn addition, required interest will change due to the changes in reserve balances at transition and restated balances in 2021 and 2022 under the new requirements. We anticipate that required interest in 2023 will be in the range of $910 million to $920 million.\nWith respect to changes in AOCI, we noted in the past few quarters that under the new accounting standard, there is a requirement to remeasure the company's future policy benefits each quarter, utilizing a discount rate that reflects the upper medium grade fixed income instrument yield and affects the changes -- with the effects of the change to be recognized in AOCI, a component of shareholders' equity. The upper medium grade fixed income yields generally consist of single A-rated fixed income instruments at a relative reflective of the currency and tenor of the insurance liability cash flows.\nAs of year-end 2022, had the new accounting standard bed in place, we anticipate the after-tax impact on AOCI would have decreased reported equity in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. While the GAAP accounting changes will be significant, it's very important to keep in mind that the changes impact the timing of when future profits will be recognized and that none of the changes will impact our premium rates, the amount of premium we collect or the amount of claims we ultimately pay.\nFurthermore, it has no impact on the statutory earnings, the statutory capital were required to maintain for regulatory purposes or the parent company's excess cash flows nor will it cause us to make any changes in the products we offer. Those are my comments. I'll now turn it over to Matt.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nCo-CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions."

My name is Jess, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to your host, Mike Majors, to begin today's call. Thank you.\n\nMichael Clay Majors\n\nEVP of Administration & IR, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Darden, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2021 10-K and the subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the third quarter results, I want to note our separate announcement yesterday that Frank Svoboda and Matt Darden have been appointed as Co-CEOs effective January 1, 2023. Gary and I will continue to serve as co-Chairman of the Board. We are very pleased to hand the rights over to Frank and Matt. You may recall that in April of this year, we appointed them to the newly created title of Senior Executive Vice President to reflect their significant contributions and leadership.\nAs noted in the announcement, Frank and Matt bring a vast range of experience and skill sets to the company. Yesterday's announcement is the conclusion of a long-planned succession strategy that is a result of a thoughtful and deliberate process undertaken by the Board. We believe this outcome best positions Globe Life for the next chapter of growth and value creation, while ensuring that our executive leadership structure continues in a way that allows us to best serve all our stakeholders, including our employees, agents, policyholders, as well as our shareholders. Larry and I, along with the Board, look forward to this transition.\nAnd with that, I'd like to begin the discussion of the third quarter results. In the third quarter, net income was $187 million or $1.90 per share, compared to $189 million or $1.84 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $211 million or $2.15 per share, an increase of 21% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 11.2% and book value per share is $44.56. Excluding unrealized losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 13.1%, and book value per share is $62.01, up 9% from a year ago.\nIn the life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $755 million. Life underwriting margin was $208 million, up 28% from a year ago. The increase in margin is due to improved claims experience. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 4.5%. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margin to be up around 23%, due primarily to a decline in COVID and excess mortality for the full year. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 7% to $319 million and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $80 million.\nFor the year, we expect health premium to grow around 6%. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margin to be up around 5%. Administrative expenses were $75 million for the quarter, up 10% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 7% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up around 11% and be around 6.9% of premium, due primarily to higher IT and information security costs, employee costs and the addition of the Globe Life Benefits division.\nI will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the third quarter marketing operations.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary. I would like to echo your comments about the appointments of Frank and Matt as the next Co-CEOs of Globe Life. Frank and Matt have worked closely with Gary and me over the past several years and helped develop and execute the company's strategy. They have a rapport that will ensure the co-CEO structure continues to best serve Globe Life's employees, agency owners, industry force, policyholders and shareholders. I look forward to working closely with Gary, Frank and Matt over the coming weeks to help facilitate a seamless transition.\nLooking at the quarter, at American Income Life, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $378 million, and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $128 million. The higher underwriting margin was primarily due to improved claims experience.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, net life sales were $76 million, up 4%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 9,477, down 5% in the year-ago quarter and down 2% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 9,441. The decline in average agent count resulted from higher-than-expected attrition. While agent count is down, I am confident regarding the long-term growth potential of this agency. Regardless of economic conditions, American Income will grow over time because we sell coverage the customers that are vastly underserved market really need.\nWe can generate sustainable agency growth over the long term because we have more than 60 years of experience with American Income distribution and its products. As we have said before, agency growth is typically a stair step process. It's best to compare agent counts over multiple years to evaluate agency growth. Liberty National Life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $82 million, and life underwriting margin was up 17% to $19 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to higher premium and improved claims experience.\nNet life sales increased 2% to $19 million, and net health sales were $7 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter, primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,784, up 3% from the year ago quarter and up 3% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,852. We are pleased by the continued growth of Liberty National.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 6% in the year ago quarter to $92 million, and health underwriting margin increased 1% to $25 million. Net health sales were up 14% to $22 million due to both increased agent count and agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,233, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up 5% compared to the second quarter. I previously indicated that Family Heritage will concentrate on recruiting, and we are seeing the results from those efforts. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,302. We continue to be encouraged by the sales and recruiting trends at Family Heritage.\nIn our direct-to-consumer division of Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% from the year ago quarter to $243 million, and life underwriting margin increased from $12 million to $39 million. The increase in the underwriting margin is primarily due to improved claims experience. Net life sales were $29 million, down 13% for the year ago quarter due to lower response rates and lower paid initial premium. As a reminder, direct-to-consumer provides reduced premium introductory offers and we do not record a sale until the first full premium is received. As I have mentioned in previous calls, sales in this division are impacted by the record inflation we are seeing.\nOur typical direct-to-consumer customer is in a lower income bracket than our agency customers and generally has less discretionary income to purchase or retain insurance. We've also had to reduce our circulation and mailings as increases in postage and paper cost impede our ability to achieve a satisfactory return on our investment for specific marketing campaigns. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 13% over the year-ago quarter to $134 million, and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $20 million.\nNet health sales were $13 million, up 11% compared to the year ago quarter. We now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2022 to be in the following ranges: American Income Life, a decline of 4% to a decline of 1%; Liberty National, an increase of 3% to 7%; Family Heritage, an increase of 13% to 22%.\nNet life sales included in our guidance are as follows: American Income Life for the full year 2022, an increase of 8% to 12%; for the full year 2023, relatively flat. It is difficult to predict sales activity this early, and it is a tough comparable for next year due to the very strong sales we've had in the last few years. Liberty National: for the full year 2022, an increase of 6% to 8%; for the full year 2023, a high single-digit increase. Direct-to-consumer for the full year 2022, a decrease of 17% to a decrease of 13%; for the full year 2023, relatively flat.\nNet life sales are projected for 2023 and are incorporated into our projections of a 4% to 5% growth in total life premiums for the full year 2023. Net health sales included in our guidance are as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2022, an increase of 6% to 8%; for the full year 2023, a high single-digit increase. Family Heritage for the full year 2022, an increase of 11% to 13%; for the full year 2023, high single-digit growth. United American individual Medicare Supplement for the full year 2022, a decrease of 14% to a decrease of 8%; for the full year 2023, low single-digit growth.\nI will now turn the call back to Gary.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Larry. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $56 million, down 5% from the year ago quarter. On a per share base, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was down 2%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline between 1% and 2%, but to be up around 3% on a per share basis. After 3 consecutive years of declining excess investment income, we expect to see growth in 2023 of 10% to 12%, due primarily to the impact of higher interest rates on the investment portfolio.\nRegarding investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $431 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the financial and municipal sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.56%, an average rating of A and an average life of 18 years. We also invested $21 million in limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.17%, down 4 basis points from a year ago, but up 1 basis point from the end of the second quarter. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was 5.18%.\nInvested assets were $19.8 billion, including $18.2 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $17.6 billion are an investment grade with an average rating of A-. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. Our investment portfolio has a net unrealized loss position of approximately $2.2 billion due to the higher treasury rates and spreads. We are not concerned with the unrealized loss position as it is primarily interest rate driven. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Bonds rated BBB are 52% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 54% from the year-ago quarter. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers.\nHowever, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs, and other asset-backed securities. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns, due in large part to our ability to hold the securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nBelow investment grade bonds are $543 million compared to $782 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3%. This is as long as this ratio has been for more than 20 years. Below investment grade bonds plus bonds rated BBB are 55% of fixed maturities, the lowest ratio it has been in 8 years. Overall, we are comfortable with the quality of our portfolio.\nDuring 2022, we have executed some minor repositioning of the fixed maturity portfolio to improve yield and quality. In the last 2 quarters, we sold approximately $324 million of fixed maturities with an average rating of BBB and reinvested the proceeds in higher-yielding securities with an average rating of A+. Because we primarily invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles.\nWe believe we are well positioned not only to withstand market downturn, but also to be opportunistic and purchase higher-yielding securities in such a scenario. I would also mention that we have no direct investments in Ukraine or Russia and do not expect any material impact to our investments in multinational companies that have exposure to these countries.\nAt the midpoint of our guidance, for the full year 2022, we expect to invest approximately $1.4 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 5.1% and approximately $200 million in limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics at an average yield of 7.9%. Also at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect the yield on the fixed maturity portfolio to be around 5.16% for the full year in 2022 and 5.19% in 2023. While the expected increase is just 3 basis points, it is noteworthy and encouraging as this will be the first time we have seen the portfolio yield increase since 2008.\nAs we've said before, we are pleased to see higher interest rates as this has a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income with no impact on our future policy benefits since they are not interest sensitive.\nNow before turning to Frank to review the financials, we want to invite Matt to say a few words.\n\nJames Matthew Darden\n\nSenior Executive VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Larry and Gary, for the kind comments. As the Chief Strategy Officer, I have a deep understanding of our marketplace and an appreciation for the operations and teams driving the success of Globe Life. I'm humbled to be chosen as one of the next co-CEOs of Globe Life along with Frank. I believe we bring a strong and well-rounded approach that will help deliver on our value creation objectives for the long term. While we will continue to adapt to change and modernize our operations, I'm a firm believer in Globe's unique business model and I am excited to continue the successful execution of our strategy.\nI look forward to sharing more as we progress throughout next year. Frank?\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. I am excited to work with Matt as we engage more deeply together in Globe Life's strategies, both financial and operational, and to capitalize on the many opportunities we have for continued growth. I am confident that our collective knowledge of the business and its functions will help continue Globe Life's success and history of shareholders' value creation. I share Matt's view on our business model. It has served the company very well over the years, and I firmly believe that it provides us the best opportunity to succeed in the future. I look forward to hitting the ground running as Co-CEO and getting even more involved in the business through the transition period and beyond.\nNow looking at the quarter. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. In the third quarter, the company repurchased 564,000 shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $56 million at an average share price of $99.43. For the full year through September 30, we have utilized approximately $279 million of cash to purchase 2.8 million shares at an average price of $98.46. The parent ended the third quarter with liquid assets of approximately $141 million, down from $318 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the redemption in September of the $300 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.8% senior notes.\nIn addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate additional excess cash flow during the remainder of 2022. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year will be approximately $360 million, of which approximately $32 million will be generated in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThis amount of excess cash flows, which again, is before the payment of dividends to shareholders, is lower than the $450 million received in 2021, primarily due to higher COVID life losses in 2021, plus the nearly 15% growth in our exclusive agency sales, both of which resulted in lower statutory income in 2021, and thus lower cash flows to the parent in 2022.\nTaking into account the liquid assets of $141 million at the end of the third quarter, plus $32 million of excess cash flows expected to be generated in the fourth quarter, we will have approximately $173 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year, out of which we anticipate distributing approximately $20 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments.\nThe remaining amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital within our insurance operations and to maintain the share repurchase program for the remainder of the year. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives.\nThus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of parent's excess cash flows along with the payment of shareholder dividends. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to fully fund new insurance policies, expansion and modernization of our information technology and other operational capabilities, and acquisition of new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs.\nAs discussed on prior calls, we have historically targeted $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets to be held as the parent. We will continue to evaluate potential capital needs, and should there be excess liquidity, we anticipate the company will return such excess to the shareholders. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate approximately $415 million will be returned to shareholders in 2022, including approximately $335 million through share repurchases.\nWith regard to the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. For 2021, our consolidated RBC ratio was 315%, providing approximately $85 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%.\nDuring 2022, the NAIC is adopting new RBC factors related to longevity and mortality risks, also known as C2 factors. While the longevity risk factors that primarily relate to life contingent annuities will have little impact on our subsidiaries, the higher mortality factors will apply to our products and will increase our company action level required capital by approximately $30 million or about 5% of our required capital.\nWe believe the conservative statutory reserve levels held for our life insurance products already provide for very strong capital levels. Given the consistent generation of strong statutory gains from operations from our product portfolio, these new factors will simply result in even stronger capital adequacy at our target RBC ratios.\nAt this time, while we do not anticipate that any additional capital will be required to maintain the low end of our targeted RBC ratio, the parent company does have sufficient liquid assets available should additional capital be required to maintain our targeted levels.\nNow I'd like to provide a few comments related to the impact of excess policy obligations on third quarter results. In the third quarter, the company incurred approximately $7.6 million of COVID life claims related to approximately 40,000 U.S. COVID deaths occurring in the quarter as reported by the CDC. However, these incurred claims were fully offset by favorable true-up of COVID life claims incurred in prior quarters.\nBased on the additional clients payment data we now have available, we estimate that our average cost per 10,000 U.S. deaths in the third quarter was approximately $1.9 million, down from the $2.8 million average cost previously estimated on our last call, consistent with the shift in COVID deaths toward older ages in recent quarters.\nYear-to-date through September 30, we have incurred approximately $44 million in COVID life claims on approximately 215,000 U.S. COVID deaths as reported by the CDC or an average of $2 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths. This average cost is similar to the average cost of our COVID life claims in 2020 and much lower than in 2021. As a result of downward revisions for prior quarters in both the number of U.S. deaths reported by the CDC and our average cost per 10,000 U.S. deaths, the net COVID life claims reported in the third quarter were not significant overall or at any of the individual distributions.\nAs stated on prior calls, we also continue to incur excess deaths as compared to those expected based on pre-pandemic levels from non-COVID causes, including deaths due to lung disorders, heart and circulatory issues, and neurological disorders.\nWe believe the higher level of mortality we have seen is due in large part to the pandemic. As the number of COVID deaths has moderated, so has the number of deaths from other causes.\nIn the third quarter, we estimate that our excess non-COVID life policy obligations were approximately $15 million, down from $28 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we anticipate that our excess life policy obligations will be approximately $70 million or around 2% of our total life premium. Substantially, all of these higher obligations relate to the direct-to-consumer channel. With respect to our earnings guidance for 2022, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $8 to $8.20 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $8.10 midpoint is consistent with the guidance provided last quarter. For the full year and at the midpoint of our guidance, we now estimate we will incur approximately $50 million of COVID life claims.\nThis estimate assumes approximately 35,000 U.S. COVID deaths in the fourth quarter at an average cost per 10,000 deaths of approximately $1.9 million. While our estimated COVID losses are lower than we previously anticipated, our estimate of total excess clients from all causes of death has remained largely consistent with last quarter. For the year ending December 31, 2023, excluding the impact of the adoption of the new LDTI standard, we anticipate that our guidance that our excess mortality will be substantially reduced from 2022 levels.\nWhile still very early and levels of claims activity in the fourth quarter could influence our views, at the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate total excess obligations will be around 1.5% of life premium, down from approximately 4% expected in 2022. This includes an estimated $20 million relating to COVID, which we currently anticipate will exist in an endemic state through 2023.\nDue to the reduced impact of excess mortality in 2023, we anticipate our life underwriting margins, again, before any impact of the new LDTI accounting, to grow in the 13% to 17% range, and be approximately 27% to 29% of life premium. Driven by the anticipated growth in life underwriting margin and the favorable impact of higher interest rates on excess investment income noted by Gary, we estimate our 2023 net operating earnings will be in the range of $9 to $9.70 under current accounting guidance, representing 15% growth at the midpoint of the range.\nAs noted on prior calls, we will adopt on January 1, 2023, the new LDTI accounting guidance relating to long-duration contracts. Under the new standard, we expect our GAAP earnings will be higher in 2023 than what would be reported under existing guidance. The largest driver of the increase is lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs, or DAC, than under current guidance due to changes in the treatment of renewal commissions, the treatment of interest on DAC balances, the updating of certain assumptions, and the methods of amortizing DAC.\nDue to the treatment of deferred renewal commissions in our captive agency channel, we do expect that acquisition costs as a percent of premium will increase slightly in the first few years after adoption.\nIn addition to the changes affecting the amortization of DAC, the new guidance changes the manner in which policy obligations are determined. Under the new guidance, life policyholder benefits reported for 2021 and 2022 will be required to be restated to reflect the new guidance and are expected to be significantly lower in those years than under the current guidance due to the treatment of COVID life claims and other fluctuations in claims experience as well as changes in assumptions in those years.\nThis is expected to result in slightly higher policy benefits as a percent of premium in 2023 than what would otherwise be expected under current guidance. Overall, we currently estimate that the changes required from the adoption of the new LDTI guidance will increase 2023 net operating income after tax in the range of $105 million to $130 million, almost all of which relates to the lower amount of DAC amortization.\nOf course, 2022 is not yet complete and actual sales, claims experience, and other events in the fourth quarter this year could impact our assumptions and projected impact of 2023 results. Going forward, fluctuations in experience and changes in assumptions will result in changes in both future policy obligations and amortization of DAC as a percent of premium.\nWith respect to changes in the balance sheet and AOCI, we noted last quarter that the new guidance adopts the new requirement to remeasure the company's future policy benefits each quarter, utilizing a discount rate that reflects upper medium grade, fixed income instrument yields with the effect of the change to be recognized in AOCI, a component of shareholders' equity.\nThe upper medium grade fixed income instrument yield generally consist of single A-rated fixed income instruments that are reflective of the currency and tenor of the insurance liability cash flows. The expected impact of the adoption of the new guidance with the transition date for January 1, 2023, will be an after-tax decrease in AOCI of $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion. Since that time, our weighted average discount rate has increased and we estimate that the after-tax impact on AOCI at September 30, 2022, all else being equal, but using current discount rates as of the end of the third quarter, would be only approximately $1 billion to $1.6 billion.\nWhile the GAAP accounting changes will be significant, it is very important to keep in mind that the changes impact the timing of when our future profits will be recognized and that none of the changes will impact our premium rates, the amount of premiums we collect, nor the amount of claims we ultimately pay.\nFurthermore, it has no impact on statutory earnings, the statutory capital we are required to maintain for regulatory purchases, or the parent's excess cash flows. Nor will it cause us to make any changes in the products we offer. As such, the accounting change will in no way modify the way we think about or manage our business.\nBefore I turn the call back to Larry, I want to once again thank Gary and Larry for their many years of service to Torchmark and Globe Life. While both of them have been part of these earnings calls for a number of years, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Gary has participated in every earnings call since February of 1995, a string of 112 straight quarters. Truly impressive. It has been a pleasure working with both of them, and I think they have done a remarkable job.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We'll now open the call for questions."

Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Executive Vice President, Administration and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael Clay Majors\n\nEVP of Administration & IR, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2021 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, net income was $177 million or $1.79 per share compared to $200 million or $1.92 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $205 million or $2.07 per share, an increase of 12% from a year ago.\nOn a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 9.8% and book value per share is $54.18 Excluding unrealized losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 12.6% and book value per share is $60.71, up 9% from a year ago. In life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $760 million. Life underwriting margin was $198 million, up 11% from a year ago. The increase in margin is due primarily to increased premium and improved claims experience. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 5%, and at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margin to grow around 23%, due primarily to an expected decline in COVID claims for the full year.\nIn health insurance, premium grew 8% to $319 million and health underwriting margin was up 7% to $80 million. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow 6% to 7%, and at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margins to grow around 5%.\nAdministrative expenses were $74 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.8% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow around 11% and be around 7% of premium due primarily to higher IT and information security costs, employee costs, an increase in travel and facilities costs and the addition of the Globe Life Benefits division.\nI will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the second quarter marketing operations.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% for the year ago quarter to $376 million and life underwriting margin was up 19% to $128 million. A higher underwriting margin was primarily due to higher premium and improved claims experienced.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, net life sales were $85 million, up 16%. The increase in net life sales was caused by improvement in productivity and new business processing. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 9,670, down 8% from the year ago quarter, but up 3% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 9,637. The decline in average agent count resulted from a challenging recruiting environment. While conditions have been tough, the components necessary for agency growth remain in place. Also in a slowing economy, it becomes easier to recruit and retain new agents. As we have said before, agency growth is a stair-step process. It is best to compare agent counts over several years to evaluate agency growth.\nAt Liberty National, life premiums were up 5% over the year ago quarter to $81 million and life underwriting margin was up 12% to $18 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to higher premium and improved claims experience. Net life sales increased 7% to $19 million. Net health sales were $7 million, up 10% from the year ago quarter due mainly to increased agent productivity. The worksite business has picked up significantly as sales were up 11% over the year ago quarter and 24% over the first quarter of this year. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,713, flat compared to the year ago quarter, but up 2% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,782. We continue to see a positive momentum at Liberty National.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% over the year ago quarter to $91 million and health underwriting margin increased 9% to $24 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due to increased premium and improved claims experience. Net health sales were up 1% to $19 million due to agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,173, down 4% from the year ago quarter.\nHowever, the agent count grew 7% from the first quarter to the second quarter. I indicated in our first quarter call that Family Heritage would concentrate on recruiting, and we are seeing results from those efforts. Producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,201, and the recent sales and recruiting trends at Family Heritage are encouraging.\nIn our direct-to-consumer division of Globe Life, premiums were flat over the year ago quarter to $249 million, while life underwriting margin declined 16% to $29 million. The decrease in underwriting margin is due to increased policy obligations. Net life sales were $33 million, down 23% from the year ago quarter due to lower response rates and lower paid initial premium. As a reminder, direct-to-consumer provides reduced premium introductory offers, and we do not record a sale until the first full premium is received.\nAll changes in the macro environment have not impacted our marketing activities much in the past, the current environment with record inflation is challenging. Our typical direct-to-consumer customer is in a lower-income bracket than our agency customers and generally has less discretionary income to purchase or retain insurance. We have also had to reduce our circulation in mailings as increases in postage and paper costs impeded our ability to achieve a satisfactory return on investment for certain marketing campaigns.\nAt United American General Agency, health premiums increased 16% for the year ago quarter to $135 million and health underwriting margin increased 8% to $19 million. Net health sales were $12 million, up 2% compared to the year ago quarter.\nI will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2022 to be in the following ranges: American Income, a decrease of 2% to an increase of 4%; Liberty National, an increase of 3% to 11%; Family Heritage, an increase of 12% to 21%.\nNet life sales for the full year 2022 are expected to be as follows: American Income, an increase of 12% to 18%; Liberty National, an increase of 8% to 12%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 19% to a decrease of 11%.\nNet health sales for the full year 2022 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 5% to 9%; Family Heritage, an increase of 7% to 11%; United American General Agency, a decrease of 7% to an increase of 3%.\nI will now turn the call back to Gary.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Larry. We'll now turn to our investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $57 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline between 1% and 2% due to higher interest on debt, but to be up around 3% on a per share basis.\nAfter 3 years of declining excess investment income, we expect to see growth in 2023 due primarily to the impact of higher interest rates on the investment portfolio. As to investment yield, in the second quarter, we invested $400 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.29%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 26 years. We also invested $25 million in limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.16%, down 8 basis points from the second quarter 2021. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.16%. While the yield declined 8 basis points from a year ago, it's worth noting that it's up 1 basis point from the end of the first quarter. This is the first time we have seen an increase in the portfolio yield since 2016.\nRegarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $19.6 billion, including $18 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. As of fixed maturities, $17.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. And overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.\nDuring the quarter, we went from a net unrealized gain position to a net unrealized loss position of approximately $814 million due to higher treasury rates and spreads. The unrealized loss position is mitigated by our ability and intent to hold fixed maturities to maturity. And overall, we are comfortable with the quality of our portfolio.\nBonds rated BBB or 53% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 55% a year ago. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Because we primarily invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles. We believe that the BBB securities we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nThe low investment-grade bonds were $585 million compared to $764 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 3.2%. This is as low as this ratio has been for more than 20 years. Excluding net unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio, the low investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity are 10%. The low investment-grade bonds plus bonds rated BBB as a percentage of equity are 169%, and that's the lowest this ratio has been in 10 years.\nI would also mention that we have no direct investments in Ukraine or Russia and do not expect any material impact to our investments in multinational companies that have exposure to these countries.\nFor the full year, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to invest approximately $1.3 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of 4.9% and approximately $200 million in limited partnership investments with debt-like characteristics at an average yield of around 7.6%. We were encouraged by the increase in interest rates and the prospect of higher interest rates in the future. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. In addition, our life products have fixed benefits that are not interest assisted.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position.\nThe parent began the year with liquid assets of $119 million and ended the second quarter with liquid assets of approximately $318 million. This amount is higher primarily due to the net proceeds of the issuance in May of a 10-year $400 million senior note with a coupon rate of 4.8%, less amounts used to temporarily reduce our commercial paper balances. The net proceeds will ultimately be used to redeem our $300 million 3.8% senior note maturing on September 15 with the excess proceeds being available for other corporate purposes.\nIn addition to these liquid assets, the parent company annually generates excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on parent company debt.\nDuring 2022, we anticipate the parent will generate between $355 million and $365 million of excess cash flows. This amount of excess cash flows, which, again, is before the payment of dividends to shareholders, is lower than the $450 million received in 2021, primarily due to higher COVID life losses and the nearly 15% growth in our exclusive agency sales in 2021, both of which resulted in lower statutory income in 2021 and thus lower cash flows to the parent in 2022 than were received in 2021.\nObviously, while the increase in sales creates a drag to the parent's cash flows in the short term, the higher sales will result in higher operating cash flows in the future. We anticipate that approximately $145 million of excess cash flows will be generated during the second half of the year, out of which we anticipate distributing approximately $40 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments.\nIn the second quarter, the company repurchased 1,388,000 shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $134.2 million at an average share price of $96.64. Total repurchases during the quarter were higher than normal as we accelerated approximately $50 million of repurchases from the second half of the year given favorable market conditions. These additional repurchases were at an average price of $94.39. Year-to-date, including $11.6 million in purchases made so far in July, we have repurchased 2.4 million shares for approximately $234 million at an average price of $98.22.\nTaking into account the liquid assets of $318 million at the end of the second quarter plus the estimated $145 million of excess cash flows expected to be generated in the second half of the year, we anticipate having around $463 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year. As previously noted, we have used $12 million for buybacks so far this quarter and anticipate using approximately $40 million to pay shareholder dividends and approximately $180 million in net debt reduction, leaving approximately $230 million for other uses.\nAs noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows along with the payment of shareholder dividends.\nIt should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand and modernize our information technology and other operational capabilities and acquire new long-duration assets to fund their future cash needs.\nAs discussed on prior calls, we have historically targeted $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets to be held at the parent. We will continue to evaluate the potential capital needs, and should there be excess liquidity, we anticipate the company will return such excess to the shareholders in 2022. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $410 million and $420 million will be returned to shareholders in 2022, including approximately $330 million to $340 million through share repurchases.\nWith regard to the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries, our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. For 2021, our consolidated RBC ratio was 315%. At this RBC ratio, our subsidiaries have approximately $85 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%.\nDuring 2022, the NAIC will be adopting new RBC factors related to longevity and mortality risk, also known as C2 factors. While the longevity risk factors that primarily relate to life contingent annuities will have little impact on our subsidiaries, the new mortality factors do apply to our products and will increase our company action-level required capital by approximately 4% to 5%. We believe the conservative statutory reserve levels held for our life insurance products already provide for a very strong total asset requirement.\nGiven the consistent generation of strong statutory gains from operations from our product portfolio, these new factors will simply result in even stronger capital adequacy at our target RBC ratios. At this time, while we do not anticipate that any additional capital will be required to maintain the low end of our targeted RBC ratio, the parent company does have sufficient liquid assets available should additional capital be required.\nAt this time, I'd like to provide a few comments related to the impact of COVID-19 and our excess non-COVID policy obligations on second quarter results. In the second quarter, the company incurred approximately $8.4 million of COVID life claims relating to approximately 30,000 U.S. COVID deaths occurring in the quarter as reported by the CDC. However, these incurred claims were fully offset by a favorable true-up of COVID life claims incurred in prior quarters.\nBased on the additional claims data we now have available related to first quarter COVID deaths, we now estimate that our average cost per 10,000 U.S. deaths in the quarter was approximately $2.4 million, down from the $3 million average cost previously estimated on our last call. As a result, the net COVID life claims reported in the second quarter were not significant overall or at any of the individual distributions.\nFor the full year and at the midpoint of our guidance, we now estimate we will incur approximately $62 million of COVID life claims, a decrease of $9 million from our prior estimate. This estimate assumes an estimated 60,000 U.S. COVID deaths and an average cost per 10,000 deaths of approximately $2.8 million in the second half of the year.\nWhile we had favorable experience with respect to COVID losses incurred in prior quarters, we did experience higher life policy obligations from non-COVID causes. The increase from non-COVID causes of death are primarily medical related, including deaths due to lung disorders, heart and circulatory issues and neurological disorders. The losses that we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels. As stated on prior calls, we believe these higher deaths are due in large part to the pandemic. Given the lessening number of COVID deaths, we do anticipate these claims will moderate over the remainder of the year.\nIn the second quarter, we estimate that our excess non-COVID life policy obligations were approximately $28 million, $10 million higher than expected, primarily due to adverse development of first quarter incurred losses in our direct-to-consumer channel. For the full year, we anticipate that our excess life policy obligations will be around $64 million or around 2% of our total life premium. Essentially all of the entire obligations relate to higher non-COVID causes of deaths.\nWith respect to our earnings guidance for 2022, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.90 to $8.30 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $8.10 midpoint is higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance of $8.05, primarily due to a greater impact of our share repurchase program. We continue to evaluate data available from multiple sources, including the IHME and CDC to estimate total U.S. deaths due to COVID and to estimate the impact of those deaths on our in-force book. We estimate the total U.S. deaths from COVID will be in the range of 215,000 to 275,000 and that our cost per 10,000 U.S deaths for the year will be approximately $2.5 million.\nBefore I close, a few comments with respect to the potential impact of the upcoming changes of long-duration accounting that will be effective in 2023. As I discussed on our February call, we expect the new accounting guidance to have a significant impact on our reported GAAP income and our reported equity, including accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI. The impact on GAAP income will primarily result from changes that affect the future capitalization and amortization of deferred acquisition costs and, to some degree, changes in the manner of computing policyholder benefits. The impact on AOCI will primarily be related to the new requirement to revalue policy reserves using current discount rates.\nThe new accounting guidance is especially relevant to our GAAP financial statements since nearly all of our business is subject to the new rules. Our products are highly profitable and persistent, and we have many policies still on the books that were sold decades ago. While the GAAP accounting changes will be significant, it is very important to keep in mind that none of the changes will impact our premium rates, the amount of premiums we collect, nor the amount of claims we ultimately pay. Furthermore, it has no impact on the statutory earnings or the statutory capital we are required to maintain for regulatory purposes, nor will it cause us to make any changes in the products we offer. In other words, the accounting change will in no way modify the way we think or manage our business.\nUnder the new standard, our GAAP earnings will be higher. The annual amortization of deferred acquisition costs, or DAC, will be lower than under current guidance in the near and intermediate term due to changes in the treatment of renewal commissions, the treatment of interest on DAC balances and the methods of amortizing DAC. We currently estimate that these changes will increase net income after tax in the range of $120 million to $145 million on an annual basis. Due to the treatment of deferred renewal commissions in our captive agency channels, we do expect the impact of this change to diminish over a period of time.\nIt is important to note that our policyholder benefits reported for 2021 and 2022 will be required to be restated to reflect the new guidance. While we aren't able to provide a range of expected impact at this time, the restated policy obligations as a percent of premium are expected to be lower in both 2021 and 2022 than under the current guidance due to the treatment of COVID life claims and other fluctuations in claims experience in both of these years. As the new guide requires us, in concept, to recognize these fluctuations over the life of the policies. This will result in higher net income in both 2021 and 2022 than reported under current guidance.\nGoing forward, we anticipate that our policy obligations as a percent of premium will be similar in the near term to those restated percentages in the absence of assumption changes.\nWith respect to changes to the balance sheet and AOCI, the new guidance adopts a new requirement to remeasure the company's future policy benefits each quarter utilizing a discount rate that reflects upper-medium-grade fixed income yields, with the effects of the change to be recognized in AOCI, a component of shareholders' equity. The upper-medium-grade fixed income yields generally consist of A-rated fixed income securities that are reflective of the currency and tenor of the insurance liability cash flows.\nOn the transition date, which will be January 1, 2021, the company expects an after-tax $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion decrease in the AOCI balance as of this date due to this new requirement since the discount rate to be used will be lower than what was used in valuing the future policy benefits under existing guidance.\nGiven the long average duration of our liabilities, changes in the current discount rate could have a meaningful effect on the reported AOCI. For instance, if we were to hold all else equal as of the transition date, but use current discount rates as of June 30, 2022, the after-tax decrease in AOCI due solely to the increase in future policy benefits would have been only in the range of $2.4 billion to $3.2 billion. Keep in mind that AOCI would also be adjusted in such a situation to reflect changes in the valuation of the fixed maturity bond portfolio.\nAs discussed on the February call, while the new guidance requires the company to recognize the inherent unrealized interest rate loss for purposes of determining AOCI, it ignores the unrealized gains from underwriting margins that are available to fund future policy benefits and changes in interest rates.\nGiven our strong underwriting margins, this submission has the effect of reporting the policy liability that understates the value of these margins. This fact, along with the noneconomic impact of this new requirement for determining our future policy obligations for AOCI purposes, we continue to believe that equity, excluding AOCI, will be a more meaningful measure of Globe's financial condition going forward.\nThe new guidance also requires a more granular assessment of the ratio between present value of benefits and the present value of gross premium, also known as a net premium ratio. Any blocks of business that require increases in future policy benefits to minimum levels or that have a net premium ratio greater than 100% will require a decrease to the opening balance of retained earnings.\nAt the transition date, we expect this adjustment to retained earnings to be less than $50 million. We will provide more discussion of the impact of the accounting change in our second quarter Form 10-Q to be filed next month, and we may be in a position to provide more guidance on our anticipated restated 2021 and 2022 operating income and initial views on 2023 earnings on our next call.\nThose are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Majors, Executive Vice President, Administration and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael Clay Majors\n\nEVP of Administration & IR, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2021 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, net income was $164 million or $1.64 per share compared to $179 million or $1.70 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $170 million or $1.70 per share, an increase of 11% per share from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 8.5% and book value per share is $69.16. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 11.5%, and book value per share is $59.65, up 10% from a year ago. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 7% from a year ago to $755 million. Life underwriting margin was $150 million, up 10% from a year ago. The increase in margin is due primarily to increased premium. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 6%. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margin to grow around 23%, due primarily to an expected decline in COVID life loss.\nIn health insurance, premium grew 8% to $317 million, and health underwriting margin grew 10% to $79 million. The increase in underwriting margin was due primarily to increased premium and improved claims experience. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow 6% to 7%. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margins to grow around 5%. Administrative expenses were $73 million for the quarter, up 10% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.8% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 10% to 11% and be around 6.9% of premium. That's due primarily to higher IT and information security costs, employee cost, a gradual increase in travel and facility costs and the addition of the Globe Life Benefits division.\nI will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the first quarter marketing operations.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary. At American Income Life, premiums were up 10% in the year ago quarter to $370 million, and life underwriting margin was up 13% to $111 million. Higher premium is primarily due to higher sales in recent quarters. In the first quarter of 2022, net life sales were $85 million, up 23%. The increase in net life sales is due to increased productivity, plus a gradual improvement in issue rates and some challenges in underwriting, such as staffing and speeding up the accounting of medical records and other information are resolving. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 9,385, down 5% from the year ago quarter and down 2% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 9,543. We are confident American Income will continue to grow. The agent count was trending up the last several weeks of the quarter. We also have seen improvement in personal recruiting, which generally yields better candidates and better retention than other recruiting sources. In addition, we've made changes to the bonus structure designed to improve agency middle management growth.\nAt Liberty National, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $81 million and life underwriting margin was up 35% to $13 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved claims experience. Net life sales increased 7% to $17 million, and net sales were $6 million, up 6% from the year ago quarter due to increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,656, down 3% for the year ago quarter and down 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,687. We've introduced new training systems to help improve agent retention and updated our sales presentations to help agent productivity. We are pleased with the continued growth at Liberty National.\nAt Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% from the year ago quarter to $90 million. The health underwriting margin increased 9% to $24 million. The increase in net writing margin is due to increased premium and improved claims experience. Net health sales were up 19% to $19 million due to increased age-up productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,100, down 14% from the year ago quarter and down 8% in the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,130. We have modified our agency compensation structure and are increasing our focus on agency middle management development to drive recruiting growth going forward. We are pleased with the record level of productivity at Family Heritage.\nIn our direct-to-consumer division of Globe Life, life premiums were up 3% over the year ago quarter to $251 million, and life underwriting margin increased 3% to $9 million. Net life sales were $34 million, down 15% from the year ago quarter. We expect that this sales decline due to the 22% sales growth experienced for the first quarter of 2021. Of all sales declined from the first quarter of 2021, we are still pleased with this quarter's sales results. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 13% for the year ago quarter to $133 million, and health underwriting margin increased 6% to $20 million. Net health sales were $13 million, flat compared to the year ago quarter. It's difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment.\nI will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2022 to be in the following ranges: American Income, a decrease of 2% to an increase of 3%; Liberty National, flat to an increase of 14%; Family Heritage, an increase of 8% to 25%. Net life sales for the full year 2022 are expected to be as follows: American Income, an increase of 9% to 17%; Liberty National, an increase of 4% to 12%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 13% to a decrease of 3%. Net hill sales for the full year of 2022 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 3% to 11%; Family Heritage, an increase of 4% to 12%; and United American Individual Medicare Supplement, a decrease of 5% to an increase of 3%.\nI will now turn the call back to Gary.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Larry. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $61 million, up 1% from a year ago. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 5%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline between 1% and 2%, but be up around 2% on a per share basis. As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $351 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.97%, an average rating of A and an average life of 27 years. We also invested $118 million in limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yields and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.\nFor the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.15%, down 9 basis points from the first quarter of 2021. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was also 5.15%. Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $19.5 billion, including $18 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $17.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. And below investment grade bonds were $583 million compared to $802 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3.2%. And I would add that this is the lowest ratio has been for more than 20 years. Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio below investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity are 10%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. Bonds rated BBB or 54% of the fixed maturity portfolio. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Because we primarily invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our ability to hold the securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nI would also mention that we have no direct exposure to investments in Ukraine or Russia, and we do not expect any material impact to our investments in multinational companies that have exposure to those countries. For the full year, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion in fixed maturities at an average yield of around 4.3%, and approximately $200 million and looked at partnership investments with debt-like characteristics at an average yield of around 7.7%. We are encouraged by the recent increase in interest rates and the prospect of higher interest rates in the future. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on the operating income by driving up net investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we do not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. In addition, our live products have fixed benefits that are not interest sensitive.\nNow I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $119 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flows in 2022. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on parent company debt. During 2022, we anticipate the parent will generate $350 million to $370 million of excess cash flows. This amount of excess cash flows, which, again, is before the payment of dividends to shareholders, is lower than the $450 million received in 2021, primarily due to higher COVID-life losses and the nearly 15% growth in our exclusive agency sales in 2021, both of which results in lower statutory income in 2021, and thus, lower cash flows to the parent in 2022 that were received in 2021. Obviously, while an increase in sales trades a drag to the parent's cash flows in the short term, the higher sales will result in higher operating cash flows in the future. Including the excess cash flows and the $119 million of assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $470 million to $490 million of assets available to the parent during the year, out of which we anticipate distributing a little over $80 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments.\nIn the first quarter, the company repurchased 880,000 shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $88.6 million and at an average share price of $100.70. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1,097,000 shares for approximately $110 million at an average price of $100.76. We also made a $10 million capital contribution to our insurance subsidiaries during the first quarter. After these payments, we anticipate the parent will have $270 million to $290 million of assets available for the remainder of the year. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows along with the payment of shareholder dividends. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after our subsidiaries have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand and modernize our information technology and other operational capabilities and acquire new long-duration assets to fund the future cash needs.\nAs discussed on prior calls, we have historically targeted $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets to be held at the parent. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the pandemic on our capital needs and should there be excess liquidity, we anticipate the company will return such excess to the shareholders in 2022. In our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $400 million and $410 million will be returned to shareholders in 2022, including approximately $320 million to $330 million through share repurchases.\nNow with regard to our capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. For 2021, our consolidated RBC ratio was 315%. At this RBC ratio, our subsidiaries have approximately $85 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%.\nAt this time, I'd like to provide a few comments relating to the impact of COVID-19 on first quarter results. In the first quarter, the company incurred approximately $46 million of COVID-life claims, equal to 6.1% of our life premium. The claims incurred in the quarter were approximately $17 million higher than anticipated due to higher levels of COVID deaths that have expected, partially offset by a lower average cost per 10,000 U.S. deaths. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, reported that approximately 155,000 U.S. deaths occurred due to COVID in the first quarter, the highest quarter of COVID deaths in the U.S. since the first quarter of 2021. This was substantially higher than the 85,000 deaths we anticipated based on projections from the IHME. At the time of our last call, we utilized IHME's projection of 65,000 first quarter U.S. deaths and added a provision for higher deaths in January as reported by the CDC, but that were not reflected in IHME's projection. IHME projection anticipate a significant drop-off in death starting in mid-February. Obviously, the decline in death did not occur as quickly as anticipated, especially during the latter half of the quarter. With respect to our average cost per 10,000 U.S. deaths, based on data we currently have available, we estimate COVID losses on deaths in the first quarter were at a rate of $3 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths, which is at the low end of the range previously provided. This reflects an increase in the average age of COVID deaths and a decrease in the percentage of those deaths occurring in the South.\nThe first quarter of COVID life claims included approximately $25 million in claims incurred in our direct-to-consumer division or 10% of its first quarter premium income. Approximately $4 million at Liberty National or 5.5% of its premium for the quarter, and approximately $15 million at American Income or 4% of its first quarter premium. We continue to experience relatively low levels of COVID claims on policy sold since the start of the pandemic. Approximately 2/3 of COVID claim counts come from policies issued more than 10 years ago. For business issued since March of 2020, we paid 624 COVID life claims with a total amount paid of $9.3 million. The 624 policies with COVID claims comprised only 0.01% of the approximately 4 million policies issued by Globe Life during that time. These levels are not out of line with our expectations. As noted in our past calls, in addition to COVID losses, we continue to experience higher life policy obligations from lower policy lapses and non-COVID causes of death. The increase from non-COVID causes of death are primarily medical related, including deaths due to lung ailments, heart and circulatory issues and neurological disorders. The losses we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels due at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable health care and potentially side effects of having contracted COVID previously.\nIn the first quarter, the life policy obligations relating to the non-COVID causes of death and favorable lapses were approximately $7 million higher than expected, primarily due to higher non-COVID death in our direct-to-consumer division than we anticipated. For the quarter, we incurred approximately $22 million in excess life policy obligations, of which approximately $15 million relates to non-COVID life claims. For the full year, we anticipate that our excess life policy obligations will now be approximately $64 million or 2.1% of our total life premium, 2/3 of which are related to higher non-COVID causes of death. This amount is approximately $11 million greater than we previously anticipated.\nWith respect to our earnings guidance for 2022, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.85 to $8.25 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $8.05 midpoint is lower than the midpoint of our previous guidance of $8.25, primarily due to higher COVID life policy obligations related to higher expected U.S. deaths during the year. We continue to evaluate data available from multiple sources, including the IHME and CDC, to estimate total U.S. deaths due to COVID and to estimate the impact of those deaths on our in-force book. At the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate we will incur approximately $71 million of COVID life claims, assuming approximately 245,000 COVID deaths in the U.S. This is an increase of $21 million over our prior estimate. This estimate assumes daily deaths will diminish somewhat from recent levels, but remain in an endemic state throughout the year. With respect to our cost per 10,000 deaths, we now estimate we will incur COVID life claims at the rate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million for 10,000 U.S. COVID deaths for the full year or approximately $2.8 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths over the final 3 quarters of the year.\nThose are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We will now open the call for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Executive Vice President, Administration and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael Clay Majors\n\nEVP of Administration & IR, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.\nSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our earnings release, 2020 10-K in any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these and reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nI will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, net income was $178 million or $1.76 per share compared to $204 million or $1.93 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $172 million or $1.70 per share, a decline of 2% per share from a year ago.\nOn a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 8.8%, and book value per share is $85.9, excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 12.3% and book value per share is [$58.50], up 10% from a year ago.\nIn our life insurance operations, we continue to see improved persistency compared to pre-pandemic levels. In the fourth quarter, premium revenue increased 8% from a year ago to $733 million. Life underwriting margin was $146 million, down 11% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to higher COVID-related claims, which Frank will discuss further in his comments.\nIn 2022, we expect life premium revenue to grow 6% to 7%, and at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect underwriting margin to grow around 29% due primarily to an expected decline in COVID claims.\nIn health insurance, premium revenue grew 8% over the year ago quarter to $313 million, and health underwriting margin was up 12% to $81 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to increased premium and improved claims experience. In 2022, we expect health premium revenue to grow 6% to 7%, and underwriting margin to grow around 3%.\nAdministrative expenses were $70 million for the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.5% a year ago. For the year, administrative expenses were 6.6% of premium, same as last year. In 2022, we expect administrative expenses to grow 9% to 10% and be around 6.8% of premium due primarily to higher IT and information security costs, employee costs, a gradual increase in travel and facilities costs and the addition of Global Life Benefits division.\nI will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the fourth quarter marketing operations.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary. I will now discuss each distribution channel. At American Income, life premiums were up 11% over the year ago quarter to $364 million, and life underwriting margin was down 3% to $102 million. The higher premium is primarily due to improved persistency and higher sales in recent quarters.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, net life sales were $74 million, up 4%. The increase in net life sales is due to increased productivity. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 9,530, down 1% from the year ago quarter and down 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,415. At Liberty National, life premiums were up 7% over the year ago quarter to $79 million, while life underwriting margin was down 12% to $12 million.\nThe decline in underwriting margin was caused by higher claims expense. Net life sales increased 4% to $19 million and net health sales were $8 million, up 7% from the year ago quarter due to increased agent productivity.\nThe average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,724, up 1% from the year ago quarter and up 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,804. About 4% sales growth may not appear dramatic. We are very pleased with the ability of both Liberty and American Income agencies to build on the significant increases we saw a year ago. Fourth quarter sales for 2021 at Liberty and American Income are higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 by approximately 29% and 25%, respectively.\nAt Family Heritage shelf premiums increased 8% over the year ago quarter to $89 million, and health underwriting margin increased 16% to $25 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due to increased premium and improved claims experience.\nNet health sales were down 13% to $18 million due to a lower agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,194, down 18% from the year ago quarter, but up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,157. We'll continue to focus on sales and recruiting at Family Heritage in 2022.\nIn our direct-to-consumer division of Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $237 million, while underwriting margin declined at 47% to $12 million.\nFrank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $34 million, down 14% from the year ago quarter. We expected this sales decline due to the high level of sales growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although sales declined from the fourth quarter of 2020, we are still pleased with this quarter's sales results as it was 13% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAt United American General Agency, health premiums increased 12% over the year ago quarter to $130 million. The health underwriting margin increased [7%] to $20 million. The increase in underwriting margin as a result of increased premium. Net Health sales were $27 million, up 19% compared to the year ago quarter. It is difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment. I will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business.\nWe expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2022 and to be in the following ranges: American Income, an increase of 3% to 8%; Liberty National, an increase of 3% to 18%, and Family Heritage, an increase of 12% to 30%.\nNet life sales for the full year 2022 are expected to be as follows: American Income an increase of 2% to 10%; Liberty National, an increase of 8% to 16%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 6% to an increase of 4%.\nNet health sales for the full year 2022 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 7% to 15%; Family Heritage, an increase of 3% to 11%; the United American individual Medicare supplement, a decrease of 1% and to an increase of 7%.\nI will now turn the call back to Gary.\n\nGary Lee Coleman\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Larry. We will now turn to the investment operations. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $59 million, down 4% from a year ago.\nOn a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat. For the year, excess investment income in dollars declined 2%, but on a per share basis, was up 1%. In 2022, we expect excess investment income to decline around 3% but to grow around 1% on a per share basis. As to investment yield, in the fourth quarter, we invested $271 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.49%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 31 years.\nWe also invested $45 million in limited partnerships that have debt-like characteristics. These investments are expected to produce additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.17%, down 12 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAs of December 31, the portfolio yield was 5.17%. Invested assets are $19.2 billion, including $17.8 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Other fixed maturities, $17.1 billion are in investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $702 million compared to $841 million a year ago.\nThe percentage of below vessel grade bonds to fixed maturities of 3.9%. Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio below investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity or 12%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as years ago. Bonds rated BBB are 54% of the fixed maturity portfolio.\nWhile this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Because we invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple cycles.\nWe believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns and that's due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nFor the full year 2022, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to invest approximately $900 million in fixed maturities at an average yield rate of around 3.9% and approximately $200 million in limited partnership investments with debt like characteristic at an average rate of around 7%.\nWe are encouraged by the prospect of higher interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up net investment income. We are not concerned about potential losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. In addition, our live products have fixed benefits that are not interesting. While we would clearly benefit from higher interest rates, Globe Life can continue to thrive in an extended low interest rate environment.\nNow I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity.\n\nFrank Martin Svoboda\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position.\nIn the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $145 million at an average share price of $90.97. The parent ended the fourth quarter with liquid assets of approximately $119 million. For the full year, we spent approximately $455 million to purchase 4.8 million shares at an average share price of $95.11. The total amount spent on repurchases included $85 million from excess liquidity at the parent. To date, in 2022, we have repurchased 230,000 shares for $23 million at an average price of $101.17.\nIn 2021, the parent had approximately $450 million of excess cash flows available to be returned to shareholders. Of this amount, $80 million was paid to shareholders in the form of dividends, and $370 million was returned through share repurchases. Including our total share repurchases and the shareholder dividends, the company returned $535 million to its shareholders in 2021.\nFor 2022, while 2021 statutory financials have not been finalized, we expect around $465 million to $470 million in cash flow to be available to the parent before the payment of interest on its debt and dividends to its shareholders. After payments of interest on its debt, the parent should have around $380 million to $385 million available to return to its shareholders either in the form of dividends or through share repurchases. This amount is lower than 2021, primarily due to higher COVID life losses incurred in 2021, and the nearly 15% growth in our exclusive agency sales. both of which result in lower statutory income in 2021 and thus lower dividends to the parent in 2022 that were received in 2021.\nObviously, while an increase in sales creates a drag to the parent's cash flows in the short term, they will result in higher operating cash flows in the future. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows after the payment of shareholder dividends.\nAs previously noted, we had approximately $119 million of liquid assets at the end of the year as compared to the $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets we have historically targeted.\nWe currently expect that approximately $25 million to $30 million of this amount will be needed for additional insurance company capital in 2022. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the pandemic on our capital needs. And should there be excess liquidity, we anticipate the company will return such excess to the shareholders in 2022.\nIn our earnings guidance, we anticipate between $325 million and $350 million of share repurchases will occur during the year. With regard to our capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries, our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. For 2021, since our statutory financial statements are not yet finalized, our consolidated RBC ratio is not yet known. However, we anticipate the final 2021 RBC ratio will be near the midpoint of this range.\nAt this time, I'd like to provide a few comments related to the impact of COVID-19 on fourth quarter results. For the year, the company incurred approximately $140 million of COVID life claims, including $58 million in the fourth quarter. The claims incurred in the fourth quarter were approximately $23 million higher than anticipated primarily due to elevated levels of COVID deaths in both the third and fourth quarters, likely due to the impact of the Delta variant.\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, reported that approximately 115,000 U.S. deaths occurred due to COVID in the fourth quarter, a little higher than the $100,000 projected on our last call. In addition, after the end of last quarter, and based on actual debt certificates received by the agency, the CDC revised their estimate of third quarter death upward by approximately 28,000, indicating the impact of the Delta variants in the third quarter was worse than they originally reported. This is consistent with the adverse claims development we experienced related to the third quarter. The impact of which is included in our fourth quarter results.\nBased on data we currently have available, we now estimate COVID losses on deaths occurring in the third quarter were at the rate of $3.9 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths, and approximately $3.7 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths occurring in the fourth quarter.\nThis is at the higher end of the range previously provided. For the full year 2021, our losses averaged approximately $3 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths. The fourth quarter COVID life claims include approximately $27 million in claims incurred in our direct-to-consumer division or 11.5% of its fourth quarter premium income, approximately $10 million at Liberty National or 12.9% of its premium for the quarter, and approximately $16 million at American Income or 4.5% of its fourth quarter premium.\nTo date, we have experienced low levels of COVID claims on policies sold since the start of the pandemic. The vast majority, roughly 68% of COVID claim counts come from policies issued more than 10 years ago and approximately 3% from policies issued in 2020 and 2021.\nFor business issued since March of 2020, we paid 394 COVID life claims with a total amount paid of $5.2 million. The 394 claims comprised only 0.01% of the nearly 4 million policies issued by Global Life during that time. As noted on past calls, in addition to COVID losses, we continue to experience higher policy obligations from lower policy lapses and non-COVID causes of death. The increase from non-COVID causes of death are primarily medical related, including deaths due to heart and circulatory issues and neurological disorders.\nThe losses we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels due at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable health care. In the fourth quarter, the policy obligations related into the non-COVID causes of death and favorable lapses were in line with projections at approximately $16 million.\nFor the full year, we incurred approximately $78 million in excess policy obligations with about $46 million of those related to higher reserves due to lower policy lapses and $32 million related to non-COVID claims. With respect to our earnings guidance for 2022, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $8 to $8.50 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe $8.25 midpoint is lower than the midpoint of our previous guidance of $8.35, primarily due to higher non-COVID policy obligations related to better expected persistency and health underwriting income being slightly lower than previously anticipated. We continue to evaluate data available for multiple sources, including the IHME and CDC to estimate total U.S. deaths due to COVID and to estimate the impact of those deaths on our in-force book.\nFor 2022, we estimate that we will incur COVID life claims at the rate of $3 million to $4 million per 10,000 U.S. COVID deaths. At the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate we'll incur approximately $50 million of COVID life claims, assuming approximately 145,000 COVID deaths in the U.S., most of which are expected to occur in the first half of the year.\nNow I'd like to take a few moments to comment on some qualitative impacts of the new long-duration accounting standard that will be effective in 2023. We anticipate being in a position to discuss the more quantitative impacts of the standard on our book of business after the second quarter of this year once we finalize and properly test our models, our assumptions and the determination of current discount rates.\nTo the extent we are in a position to discuss the quantitative impact sooner we will do so. Remember, nearly all of our business is impacted by the new rules, and we are required to apply historical data and future assumptions on every 1 of our 16 million policies subject to the rules. Given the volume and complexity of computations, we need to ensure the computations have been validated with proper controls in place before discussing the quantitative impacts. In general, this accounting change will have no economic impact on the cash flows of our business. Meaning it will not impact our premium rates, the amount of premiums we collect nor the amount of claims we ultimately pay.\nIn addition, it will not influence us to change our business model. of providing basic protection-oriented products to the underserved and low to middle income market. The accounting change will also not impact our capital management philosophies as this is a GAAP accounting change and will not impact the capital required by our regulators to be held at our insurance subsidiaries or the amount of dividend cash flow to the parent, both of which are driven by statutory accounting rules.\nThe accounting standard simply modifies the timing of when the profits emerge on our insurance policies. With respect to the impact on earnings, overall, we anticipate our reported GAAP net income and net operating income to increase under the new standard. With respect to our reported underwriting income, we expect a relatively small change to our overall policy obligation ratios and expect the amortization of our deferred acquisition cost to be significantly lower in the near and intermediate term. This significant reduction in amortization is primarily due to the requirement to stop interest accruals on DAC asset balances and to unlock lapse assumptions, which will generally extend amortization periods beyond current schedules.\nBoth of these changes will result in less amortization being incurred as a percent of premium. Thus, we anticipate our reported underwriting income and our underwriting margin as a percent of premium to increase due to these changes. A portion of the expected increase in underwriting income will be offset by a reduction in excess investment income relating to the elimination of interest accruals on our DAC asset. With respect to the potential impact to our equity, under the standard, we will elect a modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2021.\nThis standard requires a much more granular view of reserve sufficiency. For certain blocks that have embedded policy reserve deficiencies, we will be required to increase the policy reserve balance as of the transition date or January 1, 2021. We do not expect this adjustment to cause a significant change to equity, excluding AOCI, upon adoption of the standard. We do, however, expect that our reported GAAP equity, including the effects of AOCI will be significantly reduced upon adoption. This is primarily due to the requirement to use current discount rates to remeasure the policy liabilities for AOCI purposes, which are lower than our current valuation rates that are based on historical investment strategies and assumptions. Since current rates are lower than the rates assumed in valuing our policy liabilities for income statement purposes, we will have an unrealized interest rate loss that is recognized through AOCI.\nThis is especially relevant for Globe given the high persistency of our products and the fact that we have many policies still on the books that were sold 30, 40 or even 50 years ago, when the interest rate environment was much higher than today. While the required methodology requires the unrealized interest rate loss to be reflected in AOCI, it ignores the unrealized gains from underwriting margins on future premiums that are available to fund future policy benefits and changes in interest rates, which has the effect of overstating the policy liability that will be reflected on the balance sheet upon adoption.\nGiven our strong persistency, this exclusion is especially impactful the Globe, due to our strong underwriting margins and low policy obligation ratio. To lower the ratio, the more future gains from future premiums that are excluded from the computation of the new liability. Finally, as the average duration of our policy liabilities is over 20 years, the amount of the ALC adjustment is expected to be larger in the AOCI market rate adjustment on our fixed maturity portfolio, will be sensitive to changes in interest rates and will have the potential to be volatile going forward when the current interest rate used to determine the reported policy liabilities is reset each quarter.\nShould interest rates decrease from period to period, we will see a decrease in our reported AOCI. If interest rates increase, we will see an increase in our reported AOCI. Again, none of these interest rate changes will impact the amount of claims we will pay in the future. In summary, we expect the new guidance will be a positive to our net -- our GAAP net income and net operating income, and will initially result in a significantly lower GAAP equity, including AOCI due to the adjustments required in computing the policy liabilities to reflect current interest rates.\nWhile the new guidance will likely lower GAAP equity, including AOCI as of the transition date for many life insurance companies, we expect the impact will be amplified for Globe and other companies like Globe, that have a substantial portion of their business subject to the new guidance, reserves on policies issued many years ago, policy liabilities with long duration and strong underwriting margins.\nFollowing the transition date, we expect GAAP equity, including AOCI, to be more volatile as market rate adjustments impacting our policy liabilities will be greater than those impacting our fixed maturity assets. Given the noneconomic impact on our business operations from these market adjustments due to our intent and ability to hold assets to maturity and the noninterest-sensitive nature of our liability cash flows. We still believe that equity, excluding AOCI, will be a superior and more meaningful measure of Globe's financial condition going forward. Those are my comments.\nI will now turn the call back to Larry.\n\nLarry Mac Hutchison\n\nCo-Chairman & CEO, Globe Life Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions."

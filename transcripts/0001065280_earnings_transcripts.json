I'm Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development. Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, and CFO Spence Neumann. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. We'll take questions submitted by the analyst community, and we will begin with our results and our forecast. The first question comes from Steve Cahill of Wells Fargo. The question is, since the revenue increase in your forecast is primarily FX-driven, we're curious about the components of the constant currency increase. Is this due to a better underlying revenue growth, or are there specific expenses that are coming in better, like content amortization?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, I will take that one. Thanks, Steve. As you saw in the letter, we increased our full-year revenue guidance to $44.8 to 45.2 billion. That's up from the prior guide of $43.5 to 44.5 billion, so up about $1 billion at the midpoint of the range and a tighter range. As you noted, it primarily reflects the FX impact from the weakening dollar relative to most other currencies. The good news is we're also seeing strength in our underlying business. We've got healthy member growth, and that even picked up nicely at the end of Q2, a bit more than we expected. We think that'll carry through with our strong back half slate. We're reflecting that in our latest forecast. We're also seeing nice momentum in ad sales, still off a pretty small base, but good growth, and it's on pace to roughly double our revenue in the year.\nIt's a bit ahead of beginning-of-year expectations. When we carry all that through to operating margin, our operating expenses are essentially unchanged, which is part of your question. They're basically unchanged forecast to forecast. We're largely flowing through the expected higher revenues to profit margins. That's why our updated target full-year reported margin is up a point from 29% to 30. That 50 basis point increase in FX-neutral margin is really just that revenue lift from stronger membership growth and ads relative to prior forecast flowing through to margin.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThank you, Spence. We'll take our next question from Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities. Why is operating margin guidance for the full year only 30% after the upside in Q2 and a forecast of 31.5% for the Q3? Is there a timing issue, FX issue, or is there a new level of spending that will continue beyond the Q4 of 2025?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, this is really mostly timing. Thanks, Barton. As a reminder, we primarily manage to full-year margins, and we expect our content expenses will ramp in Q3 and Q4. We've got many of our biggest new and returning titles, and live events in the back half of the year. You know, Q4 is typically a, and generally almost always is, a heavier film slate. I'm sure we'll talk about, I expect we'll talk about more of this on the call. We'll also be marketing to support that heavier slate. We're continuing to aggressively build out our ad sales infrastructure and capabilities through the year. All of that is to be expected. We can manage to it. We manage to those margins. Even with that back half ramp in expenses, we expect operating margins to be up year-over-year in each quarter, including Q4.\nAs just noted, we expect to deliver strong full-year margins as we just took up our guide to, you know, 29.5% FX-neutral, 30% reported.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spence. The next question comes from Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. How has your view of the consumer and the macro-economy changed over the last 90 days?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSimilar to last quarter, we're carefully watching consumer sentiment in the broader economy. At this point, there's really nothing significant to note in the metrics and the indicators that we get directly through the business. Those are retention that remains stable and industry-leading. There have been no significant shifts in plan mix or plan take rate. The price changes we've done since the last quarter have been in line with expectations. Engagement also remains healthy. Things all look stable from those indicators. Big picture, entertainment in general and Netflix specific have been historically pretty resilient in tougher economic times.\nWe also think that we are at an incredible entertainment value, you know, not only compared to traditional entertainment, but if you think about other streaming competitors, and we start at $7.99 in the United States, and you think about all the entertainment you get, we have a belief and expectation that the demand for not only entertainment, but for us specifically, will remain strong.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Greg. I think a nice follow-up to this question will be on advertising. From Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, can you share any data points around your upfront negotiations?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYep. As we noted in the letter, our US upfront is nearly complete. We've closed the large majority of deals with the major agencies. Those results have generally been in line or slightly better than our targets, and consistent with our goal to roughly double the ads business this year. What are advertisers excited about? Growing scale is something we definitely hear. Also, a highly attentive and engaged audience. Bigger audience, but also an audience that's more engaged relative to our peers. The rollout of our own ad tech stack helps deliver a bunch of features. Our slate is generally amazing and includes a growing number of live events that advertisers are excited about.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. Follow-up question on advertising from Vikram of Baird. How have advertisers in the US responded to the Netflix Ad Suite rollout since the April launch? What features and capabilities are attracting the most interest, and how is the initial feedback in other regions outside of the US?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe've completed the rollout of our own ad tech stack and the Netflix Ad Suite to all of our ad markets now. We're fully on our own stack around the world at this point. That rollout was generally smooth across all countries. We see good performance metrics across all countries, and the early results are in line with our expectations. Now we're in this phase of learning and improving quickly based on the fact that being live everywhere means that you get a bunch of feedback about what we can do better, which is great. As we mentioned before, the most immediate benefit from this rollout is just making it easier for advertisers to buy on Netflix. We hear that benefit, that ease, from direct feedback, talking to advertisers. They tell us that it's easier. We see it in our overall sales performance. We've seen an increase in programmatic buying.\nAll of these are consistent with what we are expecting, both qualitatively and from a metrics perspective. We're also, I guess, worth noting that we're going to roll out additional demand sources like Yahoo that'll further open up the market for us. Long-term, being on our own stack improves the speed of our execution to deliver this pretty significant roadmap of features that we have in front of us. Things like improved targeting and measurement. There's also leveraging advertiser and third-party data sources, which we definitely hear demand for as well. It will ultimately allow us to improve the ad experience for our members, which is critically important.\nThat means better Ads Personalization, so the ads that I see are increasingly different from the ads that, let's say, Ted would see, and they're more relevant for each of us, which is good for us as users, and it's good for the brands. We're also going to be introducing interactivity in the second half of the year, so that's exciting. That's all to say this is a pretty significant milestone for us, one we're super excited to get behind us because now we can shift into this steady release cycle where we're dropping new features all the time, both for advertisers and for members. That's the development and release model that we have in other parts of the business, so it's fun to be able to get to that point.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Greg. I'll move this along now to a set of questions around content, as well as engagement. This one comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. 1% engagement growth year-over-year suggests engagement is down year-over-year on an average per member basis. How do we reconcile that with engagement growing on a per member household basis if that's still accurate?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nTotal view hours did grow a bit in the first half of 2025, and that's despite a particularly back half-weighted slate. To your point on engagement on a per member basis, we've mostly been focused for the last few years on measuring engagement on what we call an Owner Household Basis. This takes out the Borrower Effect. We obviously think this is the best way to assess our engagement per member because it removes the tricky comparison impacts from Paid Sharing. That metric, per owner household engagement, has been relatively steady over the past two and a half years throughout the rollout of paid sharing and amidst increasing competition for TV time as more viewing moves to streaming and gets this on-demand benefit. We're glad to have held that normalized engagement level, but we clearly also want to increase it.\nTo that end, we're optimistic and expect that our engagement growth in the second half of this year will be better than in the first half, given our strong second half slate.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Greg. Great segue to Doug Anmuth's question from JPMorgan. The content in the back half of the year looks strong with Squid Game 3, already the third most popular non-English series ever, and Wednesday and Stranger Things releasing in the coming months. You often say that no single title drives more than 1% of total viewing. How do you think about the business currently as being \"hit boosted\" or \"hit driven\"? Are you confident that both original and licensed content momentum can continue in 2026?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I'll take that. Thank you, Doug. On the first part of your question, we're definitely riding this long-term trend of linear to streaming, and that has a natural adoption curve. We can accelerate our growth with big hits. As you said, each one of them, even in success, is going to drive about 1% of total viewing. You need a lot more than just a big hit every once in a while. To your point, it's not about the single hit. What it is, is about a steady drumbeat of shows, films, and soon enough, games that our members really love and continue to expect from us. By way of example, we had 44 individual shows nominated for Emmys this year. That's what quality at scale looks like. We ended the quarter with a huge return to Squid Game. Thanks for acknowledging.\nGoing into the second half with the return of Wednesday and Stranger Things, and a really strong slate of supporting titles, favorites, and new shows. This week, we've got Eric Bana's Untamed. Next week, we have Leanne Morgan's new comedy show, Leanne. Both look really great, and that's just to name a few. The back half of the year also has perhaps the most anticipated slate of new movies that we've ever had. That starts on 25th with Happy Gilmore 2, followed by a new Knives Out film. We have new films from Noah Baumbach, from Guillermo del Toro, from Kathryn Bigelow, and it does not stop there. It rolls right into 2026. That's the second part of your question. We're looking forward to movies like The Rip from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Shirley Stone's new movie called Apex, which is a phenomenal action movie.\nMillie Bobby Brown is back in Enola Holmes 3. Recall that in 2023, Enola Holmes 2 was our biggest movie, so we're looking forward to that new sequel. Greta Gerwig's Narnia is going to be phenomenal. On top of that, we talk about return of Bridgerton, One Piece, Avatar: The Last Airbender, all three huge successes around the world. The Gentlemen, Four Seasons, Point Break—I'm sorry, Running Point, sorry, Beef, which as you recall in 2023, won just about every award imaginable and was a gigantic success for us, is back for a new season in 2026. 3 Body Problem, Love Is Blind, Outer Banks not just from the US. From France, we have Lupin. From Spain, we have Berlin. We have a new season of One Hundred Years of Solitude from Colombia. Big hit returning shows and new series from each of our regions around the world.\nThe new stuff we've got coming up, like Man on Fire, reimagining of Little House on the Prairie, the Duffer Brothers from Stranger Things have a brand new show, The Boroughs. We've got Human Vapor from Japan, Operation Safed Sagar from India, Can this Love be Translated? from Korea. Again, popular programming, new and returning, from all over the world in 2026. Unscripted shows like the reboot of Star Search. We've got Into the Doll Universe with Wonka's Golden Ticket, which we're really excited about. In our live, we've got a few surprises for you next year. Of course, we have our NFL Christmas Day double header that we're really thrilled about too. We're really incredibly excited about the back half of this year and confident that it keeps rolling in 2026.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThank you, Ted. We'll take the next question from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners, who asks, are you concerned by the stagnation in your viewing share domestically? I think Rich is probably referring to the Nielsen Gauge data. Do you need to spend more on programming or spend differently to materially move your viewing share higher?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, thanks, Rich. Look, our goal continues to be to continue to grow our share over the long term. Over the past few years, you're right, we've been able to maintain our share even as we've worked through a growing number of TV-based streaming services, some free, some paid, and the impact of paid sharing that Greg mentioned earlier, as well as this 2025 slate that was more back half-weighted than we typically have in previous years. Over the long term, we tend to keep growing as the other 50% of TV viewing migrates from linear to streaming. We'll do that by doing what we've always done, continuously improve the service. Keep in mind, since 2020, our content amort has grown more than 50%, from under $11 billion to more than $16 billion that we expect to do this year.\nOver that same time period, we definitely saw Increased Spending, but also Increased Engagement, Increased Revenue, Increased Profit, and Increased Profit Margin. That's our model in action. It is our objective to sustain healthy revenue growth, reinvest in the business to improve on all aspects of the service, and that includes growing content spend, strengthening, and expanding the entertainment offering, and to drive that positive flywheel of growth by adding value to our members, and all the while growing engagement, revenue, and profit around the world.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ted. I'll move to Alan Gould from Loop Capital next. Can you provide more information on the TF1 partnership? Why did you choose to add TF1 in France as opposed to other broadcasters as your first partner? Why is now the right time to create such a partnership? Should we anticipate similar partnerships in other countries?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, perhaps just start with the rationale for the partnership. You would think with that long list of amazing titles that Ted just rattled off, we would have enough to satisfy every person on the planet. It turns out we actually consistently hear from our members that they want more. They want more variety, more breadth of content. The fundamental purpose for this TF1 partnership is all about that goal of expanding our entertainment offering. How do we enhance the value we deliver to members? We want to provide more content, more variety, more quality. Just as you've seen us do with licensing and production, this is just another mechanism to expand that offering. In this case, it's specifically about highly relevant local-for-local content in a country that has strong demand for that local content. This is an accelerated way to satisfy that need. Why now?\nWhy was this time the right time? Well, we've invested a lot in a bunch of enabling capabilities that are either required or highly leveraged by this deal. You can think live, ads, the new UI, among other things. Why TF1 versus some other partner? We know each other really well. We wanted our first partner to be in a big territory. We wanted to pick the leading local programmer. We wanted to be highly aligned in terms of the deal, the shape of the partnership, and the values that we thought we could generate mutually, by working together for our customers. We both look at this as an opportunity to learn, to figure out how do we scale the local content that TF1 is producing to more customers in France. We're looking forward to seeing what consumers think.\nYou never really know until you get out there and get the real reactions. Obviously, we'll factor that into our plans going forward.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Greg. From Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson, with reports suggesting Apple is now in the driver's seat for F1 rights, ha ha, pun intended, I guess. Plus, UFC and MLB still looking for new deals, and the NFL may be looking to come to market a year earlier. Can you share updated thoughts on how you are approaching sports rights for Netflix and where you draw the line on something that can move the needle?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, thanks for that, Robert. Remember, sports are a sub-component of our live strategy. Our live strategy goes beyond sports alone. Our live strategy and our sports strategy are unchanged. We remain focused on ownable, big, breakthrough events because our audiences really love them. Anything we chase in the event space or in the sports space has got to make economic sense as well. We bring a lot to the table, and the deals that we make have to reflect that. Live is a relatively small part of the total content spend. We've got about 200 billion view hours, so it's a pretty small part of view hours as well right now. That being said, not all view hours are equal. What we've seen with live has outsized positive impacts around conversation, around acquisition, and we suspect around retention. Right now, we're very excited where we sit.\nWe're very excited with the existing strategy. We're excited about the Canelo-Crawford fight in September, the SAG Awards, and our weekly WWE matches. The NFL, of course, is a great property, and we're happy to have the Christmas Day double header, which includes Dallas versus Washington and Detroit versus Minnesota. Today, our live events have all primarily been in the US, keep in mind. Over time, we're going to continue to invest and grow our live capabilities for events around the world in the years ahead. We're excited, but the strategy is unchanged.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Ted. Good follow-up question on that one from Steve Cahill of Wells Fargo. What investments have you made to increase your capabilities in producing live events? What have you been able to do in-house in 2025 that you couldn't do last year? How long will it take before you have the capability to produce large-scale events like NFL games?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, thanks, Steve. I'd say, remember, when we started original scripted programming, we had zero production capability. House of Cards was, in fact, thinking about our first three years of original programming, all of those shows were produced by others. You have to go three years later, we've produced Stranger Things in-house. Today, we still have shows that are produced by others: Universal, 20th Television, which is Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Television. There's lots of available infrastructure to produce TV, and that is true of live events and sports as well. When we do more and more, we may choose to bring some of that in-house. We've already produced a few, and we're just as likely to continue to use partners with existing production infrastructure and work to make sure that those productions are bespoke, and they feel like they could only be on Netflix.\nYou shouldn't think about the mix of partnerships and self-producing as a Scaling Tool, not backfilling some lack of ability in some area of the company. I should note, by example, CBS is a phenomenal partner producing the NFL games with us, and we're thrilled to work with them again this year on Christmas Day.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nMaybe take this opportunity just to make some commentary on the general capability we've been building with live. When we start something new, we pretty much expect that we're not going to be brilliant at it at the beginning.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nWhat?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, that's true, unfortunately. We don't have any real reason to believe that. We don't let that stop us from kicking off initiatives that we believe have a strong strategic rationale, even though we know we need to develop that capability. Of course, our job is to get out there and learn by doing, and get world-class as quickly as we possibly can. If you look at our current capabilities around live, we are in just a completely different place today compared to when we first started. As a good example that just happened last Friday, we had our first concurrent pair of live events. We had Taylor versus Serrano globally delivered alongside WWE SmackDown, which was delivered XUS, both events at scale and delivered with extremely high quality.\nIt's great progress we've seen, and we've got a great roadmap of features ahead of us to continue to enhance those experiences for folks.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThank you both. Last question on the content side, or the topic of content, comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. What are the learnings from the success of K-Pop Demon Hunters? More animated musicals with fictional bands, perhaps?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nMan, that is a question from a man who probably has that movie playing on repeat in their home, if I'm guessing correctly. K-Pop Demon Hunters is a phenomenal success out of the gate. One of the things that I'm really proud of the team over is. Original animation, not sequel, not live-action remake. Original animation feature is very tough and has been struggling for years. I think the fact that our biggest hits now, Leo, Sea Beast, and now K-Pop Demon Hunters, are original animation. We're super thrilled about that. The mix of music and pop culture, getting it right matters. The storytelling matters. The innovation in animation itself matters. The fact that people are in love with this film and in love with the music from this film, that'll keep it going for a long time. We're really thrilled.\nNow the next beat is, where does it go from here? We put in the letter just how successful the music has been and continues to be. We think that'll drive fandom for this fictional K-pop band that we have. More importantly, for the song Golden and for the song Soda Pop. These are enormous hits, and they all come from a film that's available only on Netflix. We're really excited that we can pierce the culture with original animated features, considering that folks have been poking us on it.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nLet's do it again later in the year with In Your Dreams, right, Ted?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nAbsolutely. In Your Dreams is another very funny one, and also completely original.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nYep. Great. I'll move us on now to a few questions on plans as well as product. From Michael Morris of Guggenheim, he asks, Netflix continues to broaden content genres, notably with live sports and the recently announced TF1 partnership. Is there a path to additional tiers of service based on types of content available, or will Netflix always make all content available at the ad-free/ad-supported price points?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI've learned to never say never. I would say we remain open to evolving our Consumer-Facing Model. I think we've got a few important principles that we're carrying with us that I don't see changing significantly. One is we want to provide members choice, right? How do we have a different set of plans, a different price point, different features that allows folks to opt into what is the right Netflix for them? Also, how do we provide good accessibility to new members around the world? We want to grow, and that means making sure that we've got accessible price points. Finally, the plans we offer have to ensure that we're having reasonable returns to the business based on the entertainment value that we delivered. We're hoping to grow those, and those returns would grow as well.\nObviously, the reason to do that is we can continue to reinvest in adding more entertainment and building a better experience. Maybe one other thought too is there's a component of complexity and choice stacks that we have to consider in how we think about our offering is structured. Having said all that, I think we believe that the bundle is a great value for members. It allows members around the world to access a wide range of entertainment in a very easy way at a very reasonable price. I would expect that that will remain an important feature of our offering for the foreseeable future.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nA lot of value and simplicity, huh?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. From Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners, help us understand why your new UI/UX is so important as you expand live content. Beyond live, can you provide some color on what metrics have improved since the launch of the new UI, such as speed of users finding a title, and change in failed sessions?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, as we said previously, it's really hard for a new UI to immediately compete, be better than the UI that we've had for the past 10 years that's been iteratively evolved and improved. Now that we've actually rolled out this new UI to the first large wave of TV devices, we're actually seeing performance that's better than what we saw in our pre-launch testing. To some degree, that's expected because we made some improvements based on the results of that testing phase. It's exciting to see that those delivered actual better results. The rate of that change actually gives us increased confidence that this new experience will drive better performance by the variety of metrics we look at, some of which include the ones that Rich is mentioning in relatively short order.\nMaybe just a point on why did we build this and launch this new experience in the first place? Why was this so important? Bluntly, the previous experience was designed for the Netflix of 10 years ago, and the business has evolved considerably since then. We got a wider breadth of entertainment options. We got TV and film, more of those, of course, from around the world, but now also games and live events. If you think about the Discovery Experience that's best suited for these new content types, it's inherently different. Helping our members understand that there's a really good reason for them to launch Netflix and tune in at 7:00PM on a Friday night versus just showing up whenever they were free and wanted to be entertained, that's a totally different job. We really need a different user interface to do that job well.\nAdd to that, we saw the opportunity to leverage newer technologies like real-time recommendations that respond dynamically to what you need from us in that specific moment. The Netflix you get on a Tuesday night is different from the Netflix you get on a Sunday afternoon. Put all of those rationales together, and what we're seeing in terms of the performance so far, we're very confident that we've got a much better platform in this new user experience to build from, to continue to improve, and that'll help us meet the needs of the business over the years to come.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Greg. The next question comes from Steve Cahill of Wells Fargo. YouTube is the only streamer that exceeds Netflix in terms of US share of TV time. Do you see an opportunity to bring notable YouTube creators and their content exclusively to Netflix? How big could this opportunity be?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks, Steve. Look, we want to be in business with the best creatives on the planet, regardless of where they come from. Some of them are here in Hollywood, others are in Korea, some are in India, and some are creators that distribute only on social media platforms. Most of them have not yet been discovered. For those creators doing great work, we have phenomenal distribution, desirable monetization, brilliant discovery in our UI, and a hungry audience waiting to be entertained. Steve, you recently, I think I listened to you on a podcast where you talked about our business model, and I believe on this very topic. We largely agree with you and believe that working with a wide set of content creators makes a lot of sense for us.\nAs you said, if I'm remembering it right, not everything on YouTube will fit on Netflix, and we couldn't agree with that more. There are some creators on YouTube like Ms. Rachel that are a great fit. If you saw in the engagement report, she had 53 million views in the first half of 2025 on Netflix. She clearly works on Netflix. We're really excited about the Sidemen, Pop the Balloon, and a wide variety of creators and video podcasters that might be a good fit for us, particularly if they're doing great work and looking for different ways to connect with audiences.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nMaybe broadening this out for a second, taking that question to look at sort of all of the competitors that we face for our share of TV time. We've always said that the market for entertainment is very large, and we face competition from all kinds of directions. Whether it's linear, streamers, video games, or social media, it's also a very dynamic competitive market as we and all of our competitors seek to provide better and better options for consumers. One of those changes, one of those vectors of dynamicism, has been that sort of steady and inevitable shift to streaming and on-demand as more services move to deliver their content in a way that we all know consumers want. That creates increasing competitive pressure for us that we've got to respond to. We also see free services as a form of strong competition.\nFree is very powerful from a consumer perspective, so it's not surprising that some free services are growing in engagement. I think Ted said it well earlier in the call, not all hours are created equal. We have a different profit model from other services, a strong profit model. We're going to compete to win more moments of truth for sure, but especially compete to win those most profitable moments. Back to your specific question, it's worth remembering there's about 80% of total TV view share that neither Netflix nor YouTube are winning right now. We think that represents a huge opportunity for which we are competing aggressively, and we aim to grow our share.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThe vast majority of our money and attention is focused on that 80%.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThank you. Next question from Justin Patterson of KeyBanc. Could you please talk about your generative AI initiatives? Where do you think Gen AI will be most impactful over time, revenue or expense efficiency?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, let me start with Gen AI. We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper. They're AI-powered creator tools. This is real people doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization, shot planning work, and certainly visual effects. It used to be that only big-budget projects would have access to advanced visual effects like de-aging. Remember last quarter, we talked about Pedro Páramo. That's just no longer the case. This year, we had El Eternauta, a very big hit show for us from Argentina. In that production, we leveraged virtual production and AI-powered VFX. There was a shot in the show that the creators wanted to show a building collapsing in Buenos Aires. Our Eyeline team partnered with their creative team using AI-powered tools.\nThey were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed. In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with traditional VFX tools and workflows. Also, the cost of it just wouldn't have been feasible for a show in that budget. That sequence actually is the very first Gen AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film. The creators were thrilled with the result. We were thrilled with the result. More importantly, the audience was thrilled with the result. I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nMaybe to cover a few of the other areas, the member experience is a place where we feel like there's tons of opportunity to leverage these new generative technologies to improve the experience. We've been in the personalization and recommendation business for two decades, yet we see tremendous room and opportunity to make it even better by leveraging some of the newer generative techniques. We're also rolling out, have piloted right now, a conversational experience that allows our members to basically have a sort of natural language discussion with our user interface, saying, I want to watch a film from the '80s that's a dark psychological thriller. Get some results back, maybe iterate through those in a way that you just couldn't have done in our previous experiences. That's super exciting.\nWe see that all of the work that we do there essentially is a force multiplier to that large content investment that we're making. If we do a better job there, that means every dollar that we spend means more value back to our members by connecting them with the titles that they're truly going to love. Advertising is another really great area. We've seen it's a high hurdle to create a brand-forward spot in a creative universe of one of the titles that we're currently carrying. It's very compelling for both watchers and for those brands. We think these generative techniques can decrease that hurdle iteratively over time and enable us to do that in more and more spots.\nThere are a bunch of places where we think we've got an advantage in terms of data and scale, where we can leverage these new generative techniques to deliver just more benefits for our members and for our creative community.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. If you don't mind me coming back for one second, I just rolled off Eyeline as if everyone knows what Eyeline is. I probably should clarify that Eyeline is our production innovation group inside of our VFX house at Scanline. They're doing a lot of this work with our creators. I just realized that I just threw that out there as if everyone knew.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks for clarifying, Ted. Let's see. Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of BMO Capital Markets. With your evolving gaming ambitions, including partnerships with Grand Theft Auto and the recently announced Roblox agreement, can you talk to Near-Term Monetization opportunities within gaming?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. We look at the Near-Term Monetization opportunity with games very similar to how we've looked at other new content categories. You can think of scripted or film or on and on. That's essentially, if we deliver more value in our offering, we get increased User Acquisition, increased Retention, increased Willingness to Pay. It drives all of the sort of core fundamentals of our business. We've seen those positive effects, albeit in a small way relative to the size of our overall business when it comes to members playing games on the service. We already have those positive proof points. We're going to ramp our investment in this area, which is currently quite small compared to our overall content investment, as we ramp the size of those positive effects.\nWe want to remain disciplined in not investing too far ahead of demonstrating that we know how to translate that investment into value for our members. We've seen good progress, as you note, with licensed games like GTA. We've seen good progress with games we developed like Squid Game: Unleashed. You'll see more from us in both of those categories, as well as a whole new set of interactive experiences that we think we're either in a unique or differential position to deliver. We're super excited to roll those out over the next year. We remain open to the core question. We remain open to evolving our monetization model, but we have got to get to a lot more scale before that becomes a really materially relevant question. We're going to do that work first. It's probably worth restating, the TAM for this market is very, very large.\nWe remain convicted about our strategic opportunity, and excited to make more progress.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThanks, Greg. We'll take our last question from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America Securities. Given your healthy balance sheet and what appears to be a coming wave of M&A in media globally. Are there certain types of assets that would strengthen your moat? i.e., What is your view of owning successful IP or studio assets as they come to market?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, I'll take that one. Spencer, thanks, Jessica. We agree continued consolidation of studio and network assets is likely. At least with respect to consolidation within Legacy Media, we don't think it materially changes the competitive landscape. As you also know, we've historically been more builders than buyers. We continue to see a big runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. You heard a lot of that today. We look at a lot of things. We apply a framework or a lens to those opportunities when we look. It's a big opportunity. Does it strengthen our entertainment offerings? Does it strengthen our capabilities? Does it accelerate our strategy? We look at all of that relative to the opportunity cost of distraction or other alternatives. We've been pretty clear in the past that we also have no interest in owning legacy media networks.\nThat also kind of reduces the funnel for us. In general, we believe we can and will be choosy. We've got a great business. We're predominantly focused on growing that organically, investing aggressively and responsibly into that growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share purchase. I think you'll see us continue on that path.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spence. That will wrap up our Q2 earnings call. We thank you all for taking the time to join us, and we look forward to seeing you all next quarter. Thank you.",

As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. We will now take questions submitted by the analyst community, and we will begin with our first question from Dan Salmon of New Street Research. Dan asks, given the need to ensure safety and well-being of cast and crews, has there been any disruption to your LA-based productions owing to the wildfires? If so, can you please quantify the impact on this year's cash content spending?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks a lot, and thanks, Dan. Let me start by saying this is a really difficult time for a lot of people in Southern California. So many people in our industry, including our employees, were deeply impacted by these fires. The hardest hit areas of these fires, the areas around Pacific Palisades, Altadena, and Malibu, are very heavily populated with folks above and below the line who we work with every single day. We're doing everything we can to help with relief, and we're getting those folks who can back to work.\nTo your question directly, no meaningful delays in the delivery of the projects and no meaningful impact to the cash in 2025, but very meaningful disruption in people's lives.\nOur goal is to keep everything on schedule safely, be mindful of folks who need time to work through the challenges of the fires, including in some cases loss of life and home. This industry has been through a really tough couple of years, starting with COVID, going into the strikes, and now this. It is really important that we try not to delay anything and try to make sure that these jobs stay safe. I definitely want to add that we are extremely grateful to the firefighters and first responders who are still fighting flames right now. These are the real heroes here. Dan, to your direct question, no impact in 2025 on cash or deliverable. Nothing meaningful.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Ted. We'll take our next question from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Is it fair to assume that most of the upside in the 19 million subscriber additions came from the Jake Paul and the Christmas Day football games? How was the attrition or retention, I guess, post the Christmas Day games versus normal post-holiday levels?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, short answer to that question is no. At a high level, we've seen broad strength across content categories, across all regions. We've seen it throughout the entire year. As we've consistently seen across our history, no single title really drives a majority of our acquisition or engagement. Even in an amazing quarter where we had three huge live events, we had an incredible fight, two NFL games, and we had one of our biggest TV series ever in Squid Game Season 2. All very successful events and titles that we are thrilled about.\nOur estimates for subscriber ads driven by those titles combined represent a small minority of our total member acquisition in the quarter. It's really the whole service that's working that delivered the upside that we saw this quarter.\nThe vast majority of our net adds were driven by our broad slate and our portfolio globally. Ted, maybe you want to pick it up for the last half of that.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, just putting some color around that. You know, we really have built the business on variety and quality across countries, across regions, across genres, and we really focus that year round of having a very strong slate of programming for our members. We are thrilled that some folks came in for the fight and some folks came in for the games, but they stuck around for Squid Game, for Carry On, for Black Doves, for The Six Triple Eight, for Senna, and for Nate Bargatze's new comedy special. All those things all performed really well in the quarter and continue to in the days and weeks after the fight and after the games.\nWhat's really been most encouraging is that the retention behavior of those folks who did come in for those events looks a lot like the folks who come in for all of our other big titles.\nI just would add that it's great that all these big swings worked very well in the quarter, but to be able to have that translate into revenue growth meaningfully, everything has to be worked. The product, the pricing teams, the marketing, the advertising, all those things have got to be working well. We saw really strong execution across the board throughout the quarter and throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks Ted and Greg. Our next question is from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Spence, this is probably best handled by you. The US dollar has strengthened since your last results, and you said that you'll tend to underperform your margin targets when the dollar is stronger. What FX volatility do you think you can successfully hedge out in 2025? What are the best ways to estimate the impact of currency movements net of hedging?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure, Spencer, I will take that one. Roughly 60% of our revenue is in non-US dollar currencies. Think of it as the way\nwe look at it as of that.\nNow we try to hedge roughly 50% on a rolling forward 12-month basis. You know, I want to stress that we view hedging as sort of a short to medium-term solution at best. Our focus has always been to manage the underlying operating results of the company through natural hedges where we can, plus pricing and cost structure over time. Our hedge program is really just a price averaging program to smooth the impact of FX, reduce the volatility from big near-term FX moves, and avoid short-term swings to the business so that we can invest appropriately for both the short and the long-term.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Spence. The next question comes from Brian Pitz of BMO Capital. The advertising user base is growing quickly, and your ad tech has been ramping for almost a year. What are your biggest learnings, and perhaps hurdles, for advertising monetization in 2025?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nFirst and foremost, we love our ads plan because it allows us to offer a lower price point for consumers, that's more choice, good accessibility that is proving to be popular, and it means that we obviously have more people that can sign up and enjoy the growing range of entertainment we've got to offer. It's also the reason that we've been successful in driving that first ads priority. We had in our ads goals, our most primary ads goals, which were to get to sufficient scale. Q4 ads plan represented over 55% of signups across our ads countries. We've seen membership on those ads plan increase about 30% quarter-over-quarter last quarter.\nThat was on top of 35% the quarter before, on top of significant growth the quarters before that.\nAs you point out, we've seen significant growth since launch, which we're excited about, maybe even more excited about the fact that the engagement of those ad members remains healthy. View hours per member on the ads plan is similar to engagement on our standard non-ads plan in our ads country, which is a really good marker that we're excited about.\nWe've done the work, I would say, to meet our scale goals for advertisers in 2025, and that means that increasingly we've been able to shift more of our focus, more of our attention on making the offering better for advertisers to increase monetization of that growing inventory. This is going to remain a priority and part of our roadmap for at least the next several years, likely years to come after that. We're making solid progress already.\nFor example, we exceeded our ads revenue target in Q4, which was an exciting milestone to get. We doubled our ads revenue year-over-year last year. We expect to double it again this year. That should give you a sense of the slope of monetization growth that we're on. Broadly, we think of this as we're making solid progress. There's considerable work ahead of us for sure, but we don't see specific hurdles that you mentioned in the question other than just doing the work. We think our path is relatively straightforward, and we're confident we've got a significant runway to continue to grow that revenue.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. We have a follow up question on advertising from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America. On advertising, do you have all the tech and tools you need to significantly scale up, move from the crawl to walk phase?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I think you can say that 2025 is the year that we transition from crawl to walk. A big part of that is standing up our own ad stack. We launched that in Canada, and that's done well. We're testing, we're learning quickly as we prepare to then roll that out in 2025 across the rest of our 12 ads countries, starting with the US in April. The biggest initial benefit we have of using our own ad server is just enabling us to offer more flexibility, more ways of buying for advertisers, fewer activation hurdles, just improving the overall buyer experience.\nOf course, that is meant to drive increased sales and the ease of transacting with Netflix. We're already seeing the impact of those benefits in the revenue growth in Canada. That's exciting and improves our optimism around it.\nOver time, the first party ad tech platform allows us to deliver more critical capabilities to advertisers that we hear from them that they really need. More programmatic availability, we're talking enhanced targeting, we're leveraging more data sources, more measurement, more reporting, more incrementality studies. Being on our own tech stack enables all those advertising features, advertiser facing features. The other big benefit is that it just creates a higher quality experience for our members. It increases relevance. That's good for them, it's good for advertisers, it's good for us, it's good for everybody in the ecosystem, essentially.\nJust to reiterate, we got many years of building ahead of us. The roadmap is clear. We're committed to iterative innovation, innovation in advertising, just as you've seen us do in many other places.\nAs I mentioned before, while we've got tons of work, we feel the path for the next several years at least is fairly straightforward. We're confident we can continue to grow revenue at a solid pace and earn a growing piece of that over $25 billion in CTV ad spend.\n\nOperator\n\nAwesome. Thanks, Greg. I'll now shift to a couple content-related questions from analysts. The first is from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. He asked Ted, do the strong viewing numbers for the```NFL games leave you more interested in full season sports rights for Netflix, or do you still see full season sports rights as generally unattractive for Netflix?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, let me start with the viewing of the NFL games, which, you know, there are in-season games, and they are the two most streamed NFL games ever. The average minute audience for those games were 30 and 31 million. Phenomenal. Beyoncé also set a very high bar for future halftime shows, even for the Super Bowl. We're really thrilled with the viewing, we're thrilled with everything about it.\nAll that being said, we are constantly trying to broaden our programming, and live events is one of those things, and sports is part of those live events. When I look at this and say that's a really fantastic thing, it doesn't really change the underlying economics of full season big league sports being extremely challenging.\nIf there was a path where we could actually make the economics work for both us and the league, we certainly would explore. Right now we believe that the live events business is where we really want to be, and sports is a very important part of that, but it is a part of that expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Ted. Rich Greenfield from LightShed has a similar follow-up question. Has the fight and WWE Raw results influenced your decision process on additional rights like the UFC?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, well, look, not gonna comment anything specifically like the UFC, but WWE is off to a great start. Our first week we drew about 5 million views, which is about 2 times the audience that Monday Night Raw was getting in linear television. Pretty consistent with how we modeled it, how we'd hope to build the audience for the league.\nWe also saw that the non-live viewings in the day after the live event viewing grew by 25%, mostly outside of the US time zones. This is new viewing in the UK, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Brazil, particularly big markets. We're really thrilled to see how that's going so far. In the US, our viewing of Monday Night Raw was as big as the Monday Night Raw viewing has been in five years.\nWe're super thrilled with how that's going and how that's coming out. Again, just, you know, not to be overly repetitive, but we are not. We're going to be mindful of the bottom line, and it's really important that those economics do and that the big league sports, full league, full season economics are very hard to make work. For us, we want to be able to bring value to the sport, like we have to date with WWE, certainly, but like we have with the NFL too, where we were basically able to bring a big audience, a young audience, a more global audience than linear television. That has to be reflected in\nthe deal as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Ted. That's a good segue to our last question on sports. To round it out from Vikram of Baird, could you elaborate on the decision to acquire rights to the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, 2031? What were the features of the event that made it attractive, and how does this fit into your broader strategy for live sports?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think it fits perfectly into the strategy. Women's World Cup is a real TV event, totally consistent with what we're trying to do here. These matches set a bunch of viewing records in 2023, and women's sports have only become more interesting and more popular since. It's a month-long event filled with drama, played by some of the greatest athletes in the world. We're thrilled to be the home for those games in 2027, and we're thrilled to have the time to start telling the stories of these teams and these athletes, like we've done so well with other sports with our series and our documentaries.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Another question from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Did Carry On prove that movies can break through without a theatrical release in less than two months? Carry On was well reviewed and has racked up 313 million view hours. The film generated significant buzz across social media and is set to surpass Bird Box viewership. Was there an unusually high level of marketing spend for this film, or did the buzz build organically on Netflix?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThis is a great example, I think, of a movie born on Netflix that can generate an enormous audience and tons of buzz. The movie, in fact, one of the producers called me over the break that this is exactly what it feels like when I have a big movie in the theaters, which was a great thing to hear. We even got injected into the debate, the age-old is Die Hard a Christmas movie debate, and is Carry On the new Die Hard, which is we're definitely in the zeitgeist, in the culture, drawing a big audience for a movie that premiered on Netflix and had a very modest marketing spend, like we typically do.\nI think it actually draws a lot of attention to how powerful the platforms to promote to our own members, how Netflix can talk to our members where they are, which is on Netflix to tell them about a great new movie they're going to love. We have our social channels with over a billion subscribers that actually keep that conversation going. I think it's a really strong proof point that a movie born on Netflix can be a big hit and be the center of culture as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Ted. For the record, I do think both Die Hard and Carry On are Christmas movies.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nTo be continued. To be continued.\n\nOperator\n\nI think that's a great segue to Doug in this question from JPMorgan. Ted, does the agreement to debut Narnia in the theater in 2026 suggest any shift in your overall theatrical strategy?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo change at all to our theatrical strategy. Our core strategy is to give our members exclusive first run movies on Netflix. The Narnia IMAX release is a release tactic. We routinely release movies in theaters a couple of weeks before to qualify for awards, to meet festival requirements, and to prime the publicity pump a bit. In the case of Narnia, it's a two-week special event. I think it's very differentiated from other runs because I doubt anyone has a screen as big as an IMAX screen at home. It is kind of a differentiated consumer experience.\nWe've done variants of these releases many times, and doing it with IMAX kind of greatly simplifies our release process as well. Mostly, I want to say I'm incredibly excited to be working with Greta on this movie.\nWe're super excited to get it into production so we can talk about how great this movie is, more so than which screens it's on. She's an incredible director, and this is a really exciting project.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Our next question comes from Vikram from Baird, and it's about plans and pricing. How do you plan to approach the cadence and magnitude of price increases going forward, particularly in your largest markets? What are the signals that inform those decisions across the different regions and plans?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI could take this one. Our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. It's pretty much the same as we've talked about for the last several years. Of course, we look to continually provide more value to our members, seeking to wisely invest to increase the variety and quality of our entertainment offering. We listen to those members. We listen for signals like engagement, retention, acquisition. There are more secondary signals as well, all to tell us when we've achieved that increase in value.\nWhen we've done that, we ask them to pay a bit more to keep that virtuous cycle going. You've seen us take a price across a number of markets in EMEA, APAC, and Latin over the last couple quarters across most plans, including ads too. Those changes have gone smoothly. You can see those in our results.\nWe certainly expect the same for these latest changes. I think it's worth noting and reiterating that we believe that our starting price, $7.99 in the US, CAD 7.99 in Canada for Standard with ads, is an incredible entertainment value, and it's a highly accessible entry point.\nUltimately, we feel really good about our long-term monetization opportunity. We earn right now only 6% of the revenue opportunity in the countries and segments that we currently serve. As long as we continue to deliver on improving the variety and the quality of our TV and film slate, and we gradually expand the offering with newer content types, we believe we'll be able to increase that share progressively every year.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nIf I could just chime in on you, Greg, when you're going to ask for a price increase, you better make sure you have the goods and the engagement to back it up. I feel like what we have going into 2025 is just that\nwe have the returning seasons of our biggest shows ever, Wednesday, Stranger Things, and Squid Game, Night Agent, Ryan Murphy's Monster, You, Alice in Borderland from Japan, Delhi Crime from India, new seasons of Drive to Survive. On the film side, we've got new movies from Oscar winners like Guillermo del Toro, Kathryn Bigelow, Noah Baumbach, the Russo Brothers, new film Happy Gilmore 2, a new Knives Out film, and live, obviously, we've got the SAG Awards next month, Christmas Day football, Monday Night Raw every Monday night, and a few surprises there too.\nI definitely feel like the strength of slate has never been better.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I'm going to now turn to a few questions on engagement. Our first one comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Engagement is stable based on data from third-party panels. Is engagement growth a strategic priority for Netflix?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nAbsolutely. I think we look at this and say what we're trying to do is, you know, entertain the world. You measure that in how are people pushing play and sticking around for the things that they love. Bella and her team are really kind of programming into those moments of breadth and of quality, of trying to meet people where they are, finding the something for everybody and something for every mood, in every language, and in every part of the world. It's tough work, and that's it that they have cut out for them. They're doing the job of winning over those moments every night and getting people who spend right now at about 200 billion hours of programming of streaming last year.\nOur average member is watching for about two hours a day. We've still got plenty of work to do to grow that. That's what the team is very highly focused on, and not just\n\nOperator\n\nGo ahead, Greg.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nAll right.\nNot surprisingly, I would say we consistently see that, you know, engagement improvements, engagement are correlated with the other key business drivers that we have. It obviously drives retention, acquisition, etc. We are excited that we've seen, you know, continued growth in engagement, and look forward to more of that.\nSpence?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, you hit it. It all start.\nWe talk about it a lot.\nThe flywheel starts with engagement. It's engagement, revenue, profit, and it drives the flywheel. The rest of the numbers were points you hit on, I think, other than and maybe one other is just kind of note that as a reminder, in the letter we talked about the fact that we will now, going forward, twice a year on the same day as earnings release, our engagement report, starting with our Q2. In July, our earnings report will also include our engagement report, just to emphasize a kind of a steady drumbeat with earnings and with our performance.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nAnd to get a little more granular even sooner. Our next engagement report is going to publish in February, so it's next month.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nGood point.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Our second question on engagement is a little bit broader. It's from Justin Patterson of KeyBanc. What are the key steps to competing more with short form video platforms for engagement?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nOur goal here is to entertain all audiences, including younger audiences who may be watching disproportionately more short form content. The beauty is that those folks all love film and TV shows as well. You're constantly entertaining them with projects that get them so excited that they push play, they stick around, they go on their social media accounts and talk about the shows, they do tributes to the shows, you see how many. Wait till you see the new season. When Wednesday comes out, you're going to see all the social media platforms get flooded with tributes to this work.\nOur core is kind of professional, longer form storytelling, and that's a very big and enduring business. As things get pulled, as eyeballs get pulled into other places, we definitely want to be there for them as well.\nI do find that the short form services also are a great breeding ground for new storytellers. You see, we're super excited to bring Ms. Rachel over onto Netflix. Parents are excited about that too.\nWe also have got a rich history of finding projects in other places and having them up the game and be very successful on Netflix. Things like Cobra Kai, Cocomelon, and Somebody Feed Phil, which is now shooting its eighth season. I feel like the work we have to do there is to win over audiences with programming that they love. If it's Heartstopper, Stranger Things, Ginny and Georgia, Elite, or Outer Banks, that's what we have to do. We have to out compete for those moments of entertainment truth.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think consistent with that, just expanding on it, I think we see ourselves as playing a specific and differentiated role in the ecosystem. Whether it's being a place where those great storytellers that Ted mentioned can graduate to, whether it's from places like YouTube, the theater, or any other place that they come from, we know that consumers want a spot to enjoy great movies and TV shows, to have a user interface and user experience which is designed specifically around that. We know that our creative partners need someone that can participate in investing in those, to share the risk that's inherent in bringing those stories to life.\nWe want to double down on supporting that part of the ecosystem, and we want to make sure that shows like Stranger Things, Wednesday, Heartstopper, and Outer Banks, which have huge viewing and fandom, especially with those younger audiences, continue to have a place to be found, loved, and enjoyed.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Gould of Loop Capital. How do you assess your progress in the video game space? How have the engagement trends been? When do you anticipate video games will have an impact on subscriber growth or retention?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nOkay, a lot there. I'd say we've learned quite a bit and made some good early progress. Since we've launched games, we of course launched a bunch of games, with some highlights.\nAmongst them, the critically acclaimed Oxenfree 2 stands out. Certainly Grand Theft Auto, where we drove tens of millions of downloads. We've got fan favorites based on Netflix IP, things like Too Hot to Handle, Emily in Paris, Selling Sunset, and our latest big release, Squid Game: Unleashed, which we really think validates our Netflix game formula, which is enabling this virtuous cycle between linear content and simultaneous game offerings. We are just scratching the surface today in terms of what we can ultimately do in that space.\nWe already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the universe and a story, but also creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the non-interactive side. Based on all of those learnings, and under the leadership of Alain Tascan, we continue to refine our strategy and we're going to be focusing on more narrative games based on Netflix IP. These are consistent fan favorites, and we've got a lot in the library to work with there.\nWe'll also be introducing party and couch co-op games on the TV, delivered from the cloud. We think of this as a successor to family board game night, or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be. We're excited about delivering some cool experiences in that space. We'll deliver games for kids.\nThis is no ads, no in-app payments, the safe space for kids just included with your subscription. Of course, we want to do more recognizable, mainstream titles, whether that is licensed titles like GTA. We're going to have more of those big licensed titles to come that we're looking forward to, as well as homegrown titles based on our IP like Squid Game: Unleashed, which I'll just reiterate, Squid Game: Unleashed reached number one in action games in the app stores in 107 countries. It's on pace to become our most downloaded game.\nTo your question about impacts on the subscriber side, we already see positive impacts in acquisition and retention from our game playing members. Now those effects are relatively small currently, but frankly so is our investment in games relative to our overall content budget.\nWe're going to stay disciplined about scaling that investment as we see continued scaling and member benefits. To try and summarize, there's plenty more to do in this space, but we're breaking into a whole new content category, which, by the way, drives approximately $140 billion in consumer spend ex China, ex Russia, and not even including the ad revenue. We're iteratively showing our members that we are a place to discover and play games, and we look forward to continuing to launch bigger and bigger games every year.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Greg. We have a couple late breaking questions on the forecast that analysts have submitted, so I'll wrap up with two of those questions. This comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. You spent roughly $17 billion on cash content spending in 2024 and will spend about $18 billion in 2025. How should investors think about long-term spending levels? Is there a point where you reach an equilibrium where you don't need to increase spend beyond inflation?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWant me to take that?\n\nOperator\n\nSure.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure, I'll take that one. I think we're a long way from equilibrium. We're taking up our cash content spend this year, estimated from $17 to 18 billion. That's in the context of we're small in terms of view share and penetration everywhere around the world. We're less than 50% penetrated into connected households. You heard from Greg earlier that we're only capturing about 6% of our estimated revenue market. We have a long way to grow. It's really about where do we put the next billion dollars, and then beyond that, to work in the most impactful way over the next year or so. You'll see that in areas like continuing to build into big scripted TV series.\nAs you heard from Ted, we're continuing to build out live, we're continuing to build out our original programming in each of our regions around the world, and also seeing more and more kind of impactful licensing opportunities. I think we kind of grow from there. The opportunity, there's a long runway to continue to grow. We do it in a disciplined way, right. We kind of set our growth based on our top line growth and our margin targets, and then we kind of allocate as we can across the business for highest impact.\nI think you've seen us do that in a responsible way where our cash spend and our content cash amortization, it's sort of a 1.1 ratio, roughly ±, between our content amort, which runs through the P&L, and the cash spend, which runs through cash flow.\nBoth are growing slower than our revenue growth. I think you should see us continuing to grow in that way for the foreseeable future, as we continue to grow more and more engagement and please more and more, hopefully growing, audience around the world.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Spence. Our last question comes from John Blackledge of TD Cowen. Can you please talk about the drivers of raising your 2025 operating margin guidance? What are the biggest points of leverage driving higher margins this year? Spence, you want to take that?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, sure. We're always kind of looking to balance our revenue growth with strategic investment into the business, and we think we've balanced that well this year. You see we guided to 12 to 14% top line revenue growth. If you kind of do the read through in terms of, based on our margin guidance, what that we would expect in terms of our implied expense growth, you can see it's sort of high single digit, 9% ± expense growth expected for 2025. If you break that down, we're expecting sort of high single digit, roughly content amortization growth, so still below revenue growth, so some margin there.\nThat's based on, again, that $18 billion of ± expected content cash spend, and the amort moves around a bit based on the timing of titles and releases, but high single digits is a pretty good estimate. We're investing into our growth priorities. We're pretty heavily investing into our product and engineering teams to build out ads, live, and games capabilities, and also our new user interface to enhance our product discovery. We're also investing in the marketing and sales line, mostly on the sales side as we build out our ad sales organization and go-to-market capabilities. Beyond that, our support areas are kind of growing sort of mid to low single digits.\nAcross the board, for the most part, we're driving margin improvement in a way that we think is appropriate for the business while investing into our growth.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you, Spence, and thank you all for joining us for our Q4 earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thanks very much.\nDo you know what's really fun?\nMaking a website on Wix.\nHey, we're How Ridiculous. Three childhood friends and digital content creators that do epic stuff from Perth, Australia.\nWe've got about 50 million followers, we're in the billions of views, and we're a small team. We always felt like our content was all about entertainment and being fun, but there was also this sort of professional business side. One of the things that we knew was basically essential was getting our own website so people would actually see a proper official group who mean business and who can deliver. We now get unbelievable opportunities to do things like film balloon popping races with Manchester City. I don't know all the things that we're going to get to do in the next year or five years, but if we can do this as a job, anything's possible.",

Joining me today are Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos, Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Neumann. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. We'll now take questions from the sell-side community that have been submitted. We'll begin with a set of questions on our Q2 results and our forecast. The first question on our results comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Spence, Doug asks, can you provide some color on how churn is trending and perhaps share some color on what drove revenue growth in the quarter?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Doug, and thanks, Spencer. We're pleased with our performance in Q2. There was strong performance across the board, good momentum across the business, strong revenue growth, member growth, and profit growth. In terms of that member growth and churn, I'd say the kind of outsized paid net adds in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger acquisition, a little stronger than we expected, but also very healthy, continued healthy retention in the quarter, and that's across all regions. In terms of growth generally, there's probably kind of three key factors that drove member growth. First, strong performance of our content slate and wide variety of titles that delivered across genres and regions, and I'm sure we'll talk more about that. There was some positive impact from password sharing that continues. As we said on recent calls, it's tougher and tougher to tease that out.\nWe're clearly seeing healthy organic growth in the business, but we're also continuing to get better and better at translating improvements in our service into business value, including getting better and better at converting unpaid accounts. At least on the paid member front, we're also probably benefiting from that attractive entry point in terms of price point and feature set for our ads plan. You put all that together, and it was a nice quarter for subscriber growth, but even more importantly, a nice quarter in terms of driving healthy revenue growth and healthy profit growth. 17% reported revenue growth and margins that were up five percentage points year over year.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThanks, Spence. Doug also has a follow-up question on the results. We noted, or Netflix noted, that India was our number two and number three country in terms of paid net adds and percent revenue growth in the second quarter. Do you feel like you're hitting more of an inflection point in that market, or is that more about a very specific successful content slate in Q2?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nTed, do you want to take it, or?\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, well, look, I think India's growth is a story that we see around the world playing out very similarly. You look at the content, the product-market fit is what drives our ability to attract members, retain members, and monetize with them as well. I feel like what's going on in the quarter has been this ongoing build. We had this great show, Heeramandi, Sanjay Leela Bhansali. SLB is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in India, and he took on this incredibly ambitious series and brought it to screen on Netflix, directed every episode, and it's our biggest drama series to date in India. On top of that, our original films and our licensed films as films in the pay-TV window, immediately following theatrical, have continued to thrill our members.\nIf we pick them well, we program well, we improve the product-market fit, we improve engagement, we grow members, we grow revenue. It's the same formula, I think, everywhere else, everywhere we go. There's certainly plenty of room to grow in India as long as we keep thrilling our audiences there.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted. Our next question on the results relates to operating margin, and the question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America. For Spence, how should we think about the pace of margin expansion going forward, and the drivers of margin outperformance this year?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, thanks, Jessica. Well, when we think about margin expansion, we're obviously pleased with how it's trending so far. Our focus, kind of stepping back, our focus is to sustain healthy revenue growth and grow margins each year. We feel good about what we've been delivering. As you see in the letter, we're now targeting 26% full-year operating income margin, that's up from our prior guide of 25%, and it's up 5 percentage points year over year, assuming we kind of land there. The amount of annual margin expansion, as we look forward, it could bounce around each year. We've talked about this in recent quarters. It could bounce around because of foreign exchange in a year where that moves, or other business considerations.\nWe're committed to grow margins each year, and we see a lot of room to continue to grow profit margin, absolute profit dollars, and do that over an extended period of time for years to come.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Spence. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo, and it's regarding free cash flow. The question is, Netflix has raised their full-year revenue and margin outlook but did not change their free cash flow forecast of approximately $6 billion. Is this just a pull forward in cash content spend, or is there anything else that is impacting your free cash flow guidance?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nI'll tell you, nothing else is impacting it. As we've noted, as you noted, we continue to expect approximately $6 billion of free cash flow for the year. There's always some uncertainty in terms of timing of things like content spend, sometimes timing of taxes. That kind of keeps us right now holding at approximately $6 billion, but no other read-through beyond that.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Spence. We have our quarterly question on password sharing next from John Hodulik of UBS, which I'll direct to Greg. The question is, do you still have upside from the password sharing initiative, and have you moved forward on mobile password sharing, and if so, how big of an opportunity is this?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, Spence already gave some commentary on this quarter's performance. I'll talk about it more from a long-term perspective. As we said for a couple of quarters now, we're at the point where we really operationalize page sharing. It's just a standard part of our product experience. We think about the improvements there. To be clear, we do see still some significant areas for improvement there. We see those as part of all the opportunities, essentially, we have to improve the product experience. We're constantly prioritizing all those opportunities based on what we think is the expected value.\nJust to give you a sense of how wide that is, even things that we've been working on for over a decade, like our sign-up flows or the user experience that a consumer has when they want to sign up for Netflix, we have found multiple improvements just over the last couple of quarters in those flows, which have delivered material incremental revenue wins. We're going to continue to look at all these opportunities. We're going to improve things for members and for the business. We'll iterate, we'll improve them, and we think of this as just a constantly improving value translation mechanism. We want to take all the value that's created by Bela's teams in film and series. We've got more live events, games, and we want to translate that more effectively into revenue so we can continue to invest and keep that flywheel spinning.\nIf we can keep improving that value translation mechanism each quarter and keep improving the entertainment offering that it operates on top of, those two things compound and drive the business. It'll drive the business through the rest of the year. It'll drive through 2025 and beyond. That really allows us to more effectively get more of those 500 million-plus and growing smart TV households around the world that aren't currently members to sign up. It also drives our other levers of growth, like plan optimization, extra member, ads, revenues, and pricing into more value. I think about this as more of the constant work we are doing to improve for decades to come.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. I'll now move us along to a series of questions about advertising. We'll start first with Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt, and I'll point this question to Spence. You say that advertising is not a primary driver of revenue growth yet. Can you provide a little more clarity on what that means for both 2024 and 2025?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks. Stepping back, I'd say we're very pleased with how we're scaling our ads business. We talk about that in our letter. We've been primarily focused on scaling reach. If you think about even just the revenue portion of ads, it is growing nicely. The rate of growth just happens to be growing off of a relatively small base because we're starting from only 18 months into ads. To have the kind of a primary revenue impact across a business that has been primarily subscription for a long time, that just takes some time. We're scaling well through reach, through engagement, through growing inventory, and that represents opportunity for us over a multi-year trajectory to have a big and increasing revenue and profit impact on the business.\nAgain, stepping back, we feel really good about our position, our ability to sustain healthy revenue and profit growth. Ads is kind of one more tool in our tool chest there, and we're doing the hard work now to improve our service across the board. We finished the year strong in 2024 and drive growth into 2025 and beyond. We're small in every measure. We talk about it a lot. We're small as share of TV time, we're small in terms of penetration of connected TV homes, we're small in revenue market share, and we're going to grow in those areas across the board. Ads is going to be a bigger piece of that puzzle. We won't have it be primary in 2024 or 2025, but it contributes. It's a meaningful contributor. That's what we've said, and that's what it is doing.\nWhen you get into 2026 and beyond, it can be even more meaningful, and hopefully it becomes the point where it is a primary contributor given all of that engagement and reach that we're building.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Spence. A follow-up question on advertising comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, and I will direct this to Greg. Looking into your advertising revenue ramp into 2025, what are the key areas that need to improve to bring in significantly more revenue? Can you talk about the opportunities and challenges scaling up your direct sales efforts, and leveraging third-party sources of demand, primarily programmatically?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, we've said many times our number one priority, first priority is scale. We've been heavily focused on that. The great news is we've seen great progress in that regard. We've been scaling our ads member base very quickly from zero two years ago to where we are today. We're excited to say that we're on track to achieve our critical scale goals for all of our ads countries in 2025. Clearly, we expect further growth beyond that, but that represents a great threshold to get to, and then to build more scale and more attractiveness from there. That allows us to shift more of our energy now on more effectively monetizing that rapidly growing inventory. There are sort of two main fronts here. One is our go-to-market capability. We're adding more sales folks. We're adding more ads operation folks, building our capabilities to meet advertisers.\nA big component of that is giving advertisers more effective ways to buy Netflix. It's a big point of feedback that we heard from advertisers. By adding demand sources that are already integrated into their processes and their systems, that just makes it easy for them to buy. In some cases, that was a threshold item for them to buy in us. We're going to expand the number of buyers as a result of that. The other big area of growth for us is the sort of product and technology stack. We mentioned we're building our own ad server now. We're excited to launch that in Canada this year and then the rest of our ads markets in 2025.\nThat unlocks a whole set of innovations that we expect that are focused on a better user experience for our members on those ad tiers, and better advertiser features. I think a lot about this is targeting relevance, more capabilities in that space, as well as thinking about how do we do ROI, ROAS, incrementality measurements, all the things that we want. Ultimately, really, this is about bringing what has been amazing about digital advertising in terms of targeting relevance, measurement, etc., and what we think is amazing about TV advertising, which is an incredible creative format, better creative format in many cases than digital, as well as the ability to put those advertisements next to content, titles, stories that are impacting the social conversation, which is important for advertisers.\nLots of work ahead. We've got years of work to do, but that's the line that we're moving forward with.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. From Steven Cahall, his question is, given what we think are pressures on [ads arm] CPMs and the 10 hours per account per month of viewing time you disclosed at the upfront for ad-supported members, what's the likelihood that ad-supported arm drops below ad-free member arm in the second half? Would you consider raising the price of ad-supported tiers as an offset?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nOkay. Perhaps starting by just providing some clarification here. Our engagement on our ads plans is very similar to what we see on our now and ads plans. That's close to the approximately two hours of viewing per member per day across all the plans that you can calculate globally from our engagement reports. You should think of that as roughly how our ads plan members are engaging as well. In terms of ads arm, so ads arm, which is, of course, a combination of the subscription amount plus the ads revenue. Currently, because we've been scaling so rapidly, we are not racing behind essentially to fulfill all of that increasing inventory, and we're lagging in that regard. Currently, our ads arm is lower than our non-ads arm.\nThat's obviously, we look at that as both it's a go-do, but it's a revenue growth opportunity for us. As we scale into that, that represents an opportunity to accelerate our revenue growth as well. You mentioned price. We think about pricing for our ads tier very similarly to how we would think about pricing for our non-ads tier. First of all, I just think it's worth noting that we love having an entry price that's lower. That means we are more accessible for more people in our ads market. That's a great thing, because they get access to all the amazing storytelling that we are doing there. In terms of raising that price, we think about it similar to how we think about pricing in general, which is it's our job to increase the value that we are delivering all of our members.\nWe've got more amazing film, more series, the live events that are coming, more games. When we have signals from our members, this is the amount of acquisition that we've got going on, engagement, what our retention and churn looks like, we find the right moment to ask our members to pay a bit more to keep that flywheel spinning. We'll think about that in the ads context just like we would in the non-ads context.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. John Hodulik from UBS asks, can you provide an update on the CTV ad environment and update us on initial feedback from advertisers on your ad tech initiative? What features do you expect to add with the ad tech build, and anything you can tell us about the cost associated with it?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nSure. There's a lot of excitement amongst advertisers about the work that we're doing. I'd say the primary one, and again, one that we're responding to, which is sort of very tactical and immediate, is being able to provide advertisers more ways to buy on Netflix. Those demand sources are something we heard very clearly from advertisers, that it was either a real improvement for them, or it was a necessary point for them to be able to buy on Netflix. Beyond that, we hear lots of enthusiasm for the things I mentioned before: increasing ads relevancy, targeting, personalization, better measurement, incrementality, all these things that we'll be building over the next several years. Lots of excitement about that. The biggest negative feedback we get is that we aren't there right now. Advertisers want us to have all those features in place today.\nWe would love to have all of those features in place today for sure. We've got the hard work ahead of us of building those as quickly as we possibly can and closing that gap as soon as we can. It's years ahead of us to go ahead and keep building these things. Quite frankly, as we build those features, I am quite certain that there'll be more that will come onto the roster that advertisers will be asking for us, and more that we'll be excited about doing.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Our next question is for Ted, coming from Rich Greenfield of LightShed.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nHey, Spencer. Spencer, sorry to interrupt you. We didn't really ask the answer to the kind of cost thing unless I missed it. Did I miss it in terms? I can chime in if you like. All of what Greg talked about in terms of investing in the business, suffice to say, that is all embedded in our margin guidance. We make trade-offs all the time with the business. Our expenses are up 7% year to date, where if you kind of step back, we're on track to be, you can do the math, it's probably north of $28 billion in total expenses across our business for the year. We're still expecting to deliver 5 percentage points of margin improvement.\nWe try to run the business like owners, make smart trade-offs, and invest into growth like live, like ads, like games, like product innovation, and ads is part of that, both for this year as well as into next year, where again, we expect to drive revenue growth and increase our margins while investing into ads.\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nThanks for catching that, Spence. Yeah.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks for keeping us on this, Spence. Next question is for Ted coming from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Is your recent agreement to stream two NFL games on Christmas Day signaling that you need live sports to build a robust advertising business, or are you trying to create a regular cadence of high-profile live events to bring advertisers onto the Netflix platform who will then spend across your broad array of entertainment content?\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Rich. It's a great question. Let me back up a minute. We're in live because our members love it. It drives a ton of engagement, and it drives a ton of excitement. Those two things are very valuable. The good thing is that advertisers like that too, and they like it for the exact same reason, the excitement and the engagement. Everyone's interests here are perfectly aligned in that way. What we signaled to the world when we went live with the Chris Rock: Selective Outrage Special last year is that this company, Netflix, who you love for on-demand viewing of your favorite TV shows and movies, is also, I say also, going to surprise you with amazing, exclusive, buzzy live entertainment.\nSince then, we've launched a golf tournament with the biggest stars in PGA golf and Formula One drivers, a tennis match with two generational titans of professional tennis, Nadal and Alcaraz, a live comedy with Katt Williams, an entire week of groundbreaking live talk show episodes from John Mulaney, that epic roast of Tom Brady, our biggest live stream yet. Still to come, we've got a live show with Joe Rogan. We have this hot dog eating grudge match between Chestnut and Kobayashi that people are remarkably excited about. We have this long-awaited boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul in November. On Christmas Day, not just one, but two great NFL football games. I would call that a really fast ramp, and it leads right into weekly live coverage of WWE.\nIt's that thrilling, excitement, engaged watching that people are really thrilled about, we're thrilled about, and we're thrilled that our advertisers are excited about it too.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted. Rich has a part two to this question, not surprisingly. How do you thread the needle on licensing sports to drive advertising spend without becoming beholden to leagues at renewal?\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, hopefully exactly the way we're doing it by making these Netflix events, not necessarily taking on a lot of tonnage from any one league, but actually making these games events like having two NFL football games on Christmas Day, and two great games, the Chiefs and the Steelers, and the Ravens and the Texans. They're both going to be great games. It creates a lot of real excitement with the service. It's one day of football. When I look at that and I think along those lines, you'd see how we solved for that in our WWE deal, which was economics that we like, can live with, and can grow into, and contemplate what that expansion of cost and viewing would be over, in that case, as long as 20 years if we want it to be.\nI think it's really not a matter of there's an automatic disconnect between you can't do sports and have profit. It's very difficult to have big league sports and profit when you offer them entire seasons. When you offer them in this event model that we're building on, we're really excited about our opportunity to do that without the risk that you're talking about right now. Beyond that, we're in love with the kind of very profitable storytelling version of sports. If you can't wait for those football games on Christmas Day, you can watch Receiver right now. It just started on 10 July 2024 on Netflix, which is part of that storytelling version of sports.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you. Thank you, Ted. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. It's a question regarding our engagement. Ted, could you speak to the underlying engagement health at Netflix and what are you seeing there?\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah. Look, I think I talked about this a bit on the last call as well, but competition for entertainment is super intense, and we compete for every second of view time we get. Beyond that, kind of the competitive intensity that's always been out there, we also anticipated some headwinds in our engagement because of pay-sharing. Remember, we were taking folks who were watching Netflix and not paying off the service. We thought our engagement would go down. We took a deep dive into how that was impacting and how we could isolate that impact and look at it as owner households, so those folks who were not impacted by pay-sharing at all. What we saw in last quarter is that that engagement was holding steady, so that much of the engagement headwind was coming from that. Now we look forward to quarter.\nNow, I'm not going to get in the habit of releasing this as a new metric every quarter, but looking at that same segment again, that segment's engagement is actually not just steady, but up year on year. We are very excited about that. I think it's a very healthy sign of engagement growth. Even with all of that, beating down the headwinds of that and beating down competition, we're still about 10% of TV time in every country we operate in. There is still lots of room to grow, but we are very pleased with our engagement, but not fully satisfied.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your primary competitor for more passive home entertainment engagement increasingly looks to be YouTube. What are you doing in terms of programming and product to try and take share from YouTube in the future, or is this not a focus? Are there key verticals like kids programming where you see YouTube as particularly advantageous? Perhaps Ted, you and Greg can tag team on this one.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, sure. Looking at the Nielsen data that just released for June, what you see there is Netflix and YouTube are the clear leaders in direct-to-consumer entertainment. Us and YouTube represent about 50% of all streaming to the TV in the US. We use the US only because that's where we have the data. Really what we're focused on here is focusing ourselves on that other 80% of total TV time that isn't going to either us or YouTube. That's both streaming continuing to expand, which it did in June. The share of TV time grew against linear. As linear continues to give, I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow as long as we keep executing well. Now, we clearly do compete with YouTube in certain segments of their business, and we certainly compete with them for time and attention.\nOur services also feed each other really well. Remember, our shows are the most watched, talked about, and award-nominated. We just came out of 107 Emmy nominations for our slate this year yesterday. Our teasers, trailers, behind-the-scenes clips, and all those kinds of things are incredibly popular on YouTube. In that way, we kind of feed each other pretty nicely. Greg, I don't know if you want to add anything.\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nSure. I think it's also important to note that Netflix fulfills an important and differentiated need for both consumers who really want amazing spectacle movies and TV shows, as well as an important need for creators who want partners that can share in the risk that's inherent in bringing those stories to life. You think about shows like Stranger Things or Wednesday, Heartstopper, Outer Banks. These shows create amazing viewing fandom, especially with younger audiences. It's not just one generation. It's really hard to imagine how that kind of big creative bet would happen and be possible within YouTube's model. To Ted's point, it is very competitive out there. We also feel confident that our model works. It works well for our consumers, it works well for creators, and it works well for our business and helps us generate significant operating margins.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted and Greg. Our next question comes from Maria Ripps of Canaccord. Netflix's CTO, Elizabeth Stone, recently appeared on a podcast where she said that Netflix is exploring how to integrate generative AI into the platform to improve the member experience. Do you think the technology could have more of a potential impact on the content creation or discovery side? How do you think about the relative impact on engagement from improving discovery versus content? Greg, over to you for this one.\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, we've been using similar technologies, AI and ML, for many years to improve the discovery experience and drive more engagement through those improvements. We think the generative AI has tremendous potential to improve our recommendations and discovery systems even further. We want to make it even easier for people to find an amazing story that's just perfect for them in that moment. I think it's also worth noting that the key to our success stacks, right? It's quality at all levels. It's great movies, great TV shows, great games, great live events, and a great and constantly improving recommendation system that helps unlock all of that value for all of those stories.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nTed's question.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, it begs the question about the impact on creative with AI going forward, which is hard to predict, obviously. I would say this. I think that AI is going to generate a great set of creator tools, a great way for creators to tell better stories. One thing that's sure, if you look back over 100 years of entertainment, you can see how great technology and great entertainment work hand in hand to build great, big businesses. You could look no further than animation. When animation didn't get cheaper, it got better in the move from hand-drawn to CG animation. More people work in animation today than ever in history. I'm pretty sure that there's a better business and a bigger business in making content 10% better than it is making it 50% cheaper.\nI think that shows and movies, they win with the audience when they connect. It's in the beauty of the writing, the chemistry of the actors, the surprise, and the plot twist, all those things. I'm not saying that audiences don't notice all these other things, but I think they largely care mostly about connecting with the storytelling. I'd say they probably don't care much about budgets and arguably maybe not even about the technology to deliver it. My point is they're looking to connect, so we have to focus on how to tell on the quality of the storytelling. There's a lot of filmmakers and a lot of producers experimenting with AI today. They're super excited about how useful a tool it can be.\nWe got to see how that develops before we can make any meaningful predictions of what it means for anybody. Our goal remains unchanged, which is telling great stories.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted and Greg. We now have a question from Ben Swinburne regarding product. The question for Greg is, can you dimensionalize the opportunity from a new homepage? You said that this is the biggest update in a decade, which sounds meaningful. What are the primary areas of improvement you're targeting with this?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, it's hard to know exactly at this moment how much benefit that new homepage will derive. I think it's worth noting that it's less about the improvements that we're going to deliver initially, it's more about creating a structure that allows us to evolve and advance more freely than the current structure does. In terms of what are the pain points, what are we trying to solve, a lot of this is getting to the increase in diversity of entertainment that we are now offering. We've been amazing at film and series for a long period of time, but now increasingly we're adding live events into it. It's live events like the Brady Roast, which was incredible, but it's a sort of one-off event that we have to create demand for.\nIt's live events like WWE, which are consistent and repeating, that we want to make sure that fans of that experience have an easy way to access those things. We're increasingly promoting games as well into our service. What we found is we need to create structures that allow us to flexibly go from one type of content and entertainment to another in terms of how we're promoting and connecting those. There are things like that. There are also things like we want to increasingly recognize that we're doing, even in the same content type, we're doing different jobs for our users in different moments. That could be Sunday afternoon family movie time.\nThat'd be a great experience if we want to provide exactly the right discovery and choosing experience for versus maybe late on Thursday night when you're coming home and you just want to get into the next episode of the series that you're currently cruising through. It's that kind of flexibility we want to provide. Our expectation is that this new structure will allow us to deliver, as the old structure did for a decade, multiple repetitive, material benefits to users in terms of engagement, which lead into retention, and then revenue. Again, that'll be a long iterative journey. Mostly we're trying to take that first step and set us up for that.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nLess technical too, Greg. The UI is beautiful.\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nThere we go. We like beauty as well. Beauty is good.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nIt is. It really is.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you. Next question is from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. What have been the early results from phasing out the basic tier in a handful of your markets, and how does that tie back to success in selling ads? Greg, do you want to take that one?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nSure. As you've seen us do multiple times before, we spend a lot of energy on the right product experience for doing this migration. What we do is we roll it out, we test it, and we see how that goes. I'll let our members tell us if we did a good job there or not. We make whatever changes and iterations before we then scale it out and roll it even further. I think it's worth noting here that we feel like in this migration, we've got a very strong offering for our members. Essentially, we're providing them a better experience, two streams versus one. We've got higher definition, we've got downloads, and of course, all at a lower price, $6.99 in the United States. We think that represents a tremendous entertainment value, and it includes ads.\nFor members who don't want that ads experience, they, of course, can choose our ads-free standard or premium plans as well. In terms of performance, I'll just let our actions speak for ourselves. When those things go well, we typically roll it out, and we've had the confidence to move forward with that change in the US and France. That's an indicator of how it's going.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. The question is regarding gaming. Can you provide any update on your gaming initiative, user engagement, and your ability to scale your gaming efforts?\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nSure. Games is a big market. It's almost $150 billion ex-China and Russia, and not including ad revenue, which we aren't participating in in our current model. We're getting close to three years into our gaming initiative, and we're happy with the progress that we've seen. We've set ourselves pretty aggressive engagement growth targets, and we've met those, exceeded those in many cases. In 2023, we tripled that engagement. We're looking good in our engagement growth in 2024, and we've set even more aggressive growth goals for 2025 and 2026. Worth noting that that engagement and that impact on our overall business at the current scale, it's still quite small. It's also probably worth noting that the investment level in games relative to our overall content spend is also quite small. We've calibrated the growth and investment with the growth and in-business impact. We're being disciplined about how we scale that.\nNow, obviously, the job is to continue to grow that engagement to the place where it has a material impact on the business. I think you've seen this trajectory with us before, whether it's been a new content genre like unscripted or film, or maybe getting the content mix right for a particular country. You can think about Japan or India, which we're now in an amazing place through the hard work of our teams there. We continually iterate. We refine our programming based on the signals we get from our members. If you look over several years with that model, we can make a huge amount of progress. We've launched over 100 games so far. We've seen what works, what doesn't work.\nWe're refining our program to do more of what is working with the 80-plus games that we currently have in development. One of those things that really is working is connecting our members with games based on specific Netflix IP that they love. This is an area that we've been able to move in quickly in a particular space, which is interactive narrative games. These are easier to build, and we place those in a narrative hub that we call Netflix Stories. In Q2, we launched Virgin River and Perfect Match. Starting this month in July, we're going to launch about one new title per month into Netflix Stories. This is amazing IP like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset, and we have lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, I just want to chime in for a second, Greg, if you don't mind. This is why I'm really excited about the opportunity in games, which is the way that it's pretty rare for a new content vertical like this to actually complement or draft off of each other. Every once in a while, we get something like Squid Game: The Challenge following Squid Game, the scripted series. I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable. I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the super fan a place to be in between seasons, and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters, new storylines, or new plot twists.\nYou could do those kinds of things, and then they could then materialize in the next season or in the sequel to the film. It's a really great opportunity, and a rare one where one and one equals three here. To kind of replicate some of the success we've seen building fandom with live events and consumer products, this actually fits really nicely into that. I'm really excited to see where this goes.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted. Thank you, Greg. Our last question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America. The question is regarding content spend. Ted, you have targeted $17 billion in cash content spend this year. You're increasing your sports spending within that. How should we think about your spending on entertainment or non-sports entertainment? What's the overall content spending growth going forward?\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, thanks for the question. I would like to just back up a little bit and say that creating TV and films for a big global audience is a creative process. Remember, we're programming for more than 600 million people around the world who are watching us for a couple of hours a day every day. We've got our work cut out for us. That $17 billion, all those exciting things we talked about earlier, are all tucked into that $17 billion. That $17 billion will grow as our revenue grows. It won't grow as fast as our revenue grows, but it will grow to accommodate that. I think what's really important and where I think we have a real interesting advantage here is that we have these distributed creative teams all over the world.\nWhat's great about that is they are very tightly wound into the creative ecosystem in all these different countries, the star systems, the producer systems, and, more importantly, the culture, what fans in those countries really love. We've got all these folks working at the same time so that in this creative process, which does have hot streaks and cold streaks, they can be operating pretty simultaneously to create a very steady cadence of big, exciting hits. We certainly compete with Hollywood to make the best and most popular programming in the world. We're also doing that in India, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Korea, Japan, all over Southeast Asia, Mexico, Colombia, Spain, Argentina, and the UK.\nThe program that's created, the programming that we create in those countries, again, all part of that $17 billion, are all designed to thrill the local audience. When they really, really thrill the local audience, there's a possibility and sometimes a probability that they could find a gigantic audience all over the world, including in North America. The team in EMEA, particularly in the UK, is doing a remarkable job of this right now. They have been able to deliver big global hits, but they've been sensational in-country. Baby Reindeer and The Gentlemen both landed with Emmy nominations yesterday and have been sensations in the US, but they are a phenomenon in the UK. More than 50% of all of our members in the UK have watched or are watching Baby Reindeer and The Gentlemen. Similarly, with One Day, our original film, Scoop.\nThose things that are thrilling the world are super serving the British audience. The same thing just came out of Paris or out of France with Under Paris, which was 90 million views, 157 million view hours around the world. More than half of every French member loves this movie. Same thing with the Asunta Case in Spain. More than 50% watching in Spain, and big watching all over the world. Queen of Tears in Korea is another example of that's happening in APAC right now. This kind of like super serving local audiences, creating global content around the world, gives us an efficiency that I think is getting better and better, and a muscle that's getting stronger and stronger that I'm really excited about. How does that play out? Our slate coming up is unbelievable.\nAs we've currently forecast what we're going to deliver for the rest of this year and what we're going to deliver into 2025, just before the end of this year, we've got Squid Game return, we've got Emily in Paris return, you've got a new season of Selling Sunset, Lincoln Lawyer, The Diplomat, Virgin River, Love is Blind. Ryan Murphy has an incredible new season of Monsters that tells the Eric and Lyle Menendez story. That's all just coming up before the end of the year. Looking forward to the next through 2025, you've got new seasons of Wednesday, Stranger Things, and Night Agent. We're in production on One Piece, so there's a ton of excitement there just in our series. This week, we kicked off the finale of Cobra Kai, which is going to blow your mind.\nAugust 8, we've got the finale of Umbrella Academy kicking off. Then brand new series that we're also thrilled about, Susanne Bier's Perfect Couple, which has got Nicole Kidman and just a really fun, fun thriller. Nobody Wants This from Kristen Bell and Adam Brody. Black Doves, a beautiful show out of the UK. Beauty in Black from Tyler Perry. No Good Deed, which is bringing Ray Romano and Lisa Kudrow back to TV. Classic Spy with Ted Danson. From Brazil, we have Senna. From Colombia, we've got 100 Years of Solitude. Of course, all those live events I talked to you about. Our movie slate is fantastic with Rebel Ridge, Will and Harper, The Six Triple Eight, The Piano Lesson, and Carry-On. We have got a lot packed into that.\nOur goal and our mission here is we have to spend the next billion dollars of programming better than anyone else in the world. There's no one better at doing it than Netflix. We're excited.\n\nGregory Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nSpencer, how do you not get excited about that, and then also get excited about that we're going to do all that while growing content spends lower than revenue? That's a lot of stuff going on. Thanks, Ted.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nIt's all in there.\n\nTheodore A. Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nIt's all in there.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nThe hot dog contest too, Spencer. Don't forget that.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix Inc.\n\nAll right. Well, I'm going to leave it at that since it sounds like we're going to have a lot to watch. We all need a little bit more time. We'll end the Q2 call here. Thank you, Ted, Greg, and Spencer for joining us today. Thank you, investors and analysts, for dialing into our call. We look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Thank you very much.",

Joining me today are Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Newman. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, we will now take questions that have been submitted by the analyst community. We'll begin first with some questions about paid membership reporting, our results, and forecast. For our first question, it comes from Justin Patterson of KeyBank, and I'll direct this at Greg initially. Greg, could you please talk about the decision to stop reporting quarterly membership and ARM data in 2025? Why eliminate this? Since you said success starts with engagement, how are you thinking of expanding these disclosures?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, as we noted in the letter, we've evolved, and we're going to continue to evolve developing our revenue model and adding things like advertising and our extra member feature, things that aren't directly connected to a number of members. We've also evolved our pricing and plans with multiple tiers, different price points across different countries. I think those price points are going to become increasingly different. Each incremental member has a different business impact. All of that means that that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price, is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business. This change is really motivated by wanting to focus on what we see are the key metrics that we think matter most to the business.\nWe're going to report and guide on revenue, OI, OI margin, net income, EPS, free cash flow. We'll add a new annual guidance on our revenue range to give you a little bit more of a long-term view. We'll also, you know, we're not going to be silent on members as well. We'll periodically update when we grow and we hit certain major milestones, we'll announce those. It's just not going to be part of our regular reporting. We want to do all of this thoughtfully and give everyone time to adjust this transition. We're going to continue to report subscribers until Q1 of next year, which links into our next annual revenue guidance for 2025. We think that provides some long-range continuity, and we expect that will provide an effective bridge and transition.\nUltimately, we think this is a better approach that reflects the evolution of the business, and it more matches and is consistent with how we manage internally to engagement, revenue, and profit.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, and on engagement, Greg, just a reminder, you know, we currently report our engagement on our bi-annual engagement report, leading the industry in viewing transparency and granularity. We're going to look into building on that both in granularity, which will be kind of tough. Our current report covers about 99% of the viewing on Netflix, but we'll look at the regularity in different ways that we can make it even easier to track our progress on engagement. Importantly, why we focus on engagement is because we believe it's the single best indicator of member satisfaction with our offering. It is a leading indicator for retention and acquisition over time. Happy members watch more, they stick around longer, they tell friends, which all grows engagement, revenue, and profit, our North Stars. We believe that those are the measurements of success in streaming.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ted and Greg. I'll move us along to the next question from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, who asked, Two years ago, Netflix stopped adding members. What changes inside Netflix and/or the broader industry explain the significant improvement in member growth we're seeing today, excluding the pay-sharing initiative? In other words, what are you doing better today as a company than in the first half of 2022?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nThat's a great question. I would say the thing we're doing is we're thrilling our members. That's the thing we set out to do. Talk about why we all bounced out of bed in the morning. You know, look at this last quarter, eight of the first 11 weeks of the year, we've had the number one film on streaming. Nine of the first 11 weeks, we've had the number one original series. I'm talking about hits like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Griselda, Damsel, Love is Blind, The Three-Body Problem, all of that just in the last few months. This consistent, dependable, and expected drumbeat of hit shows, films, and games, that's the business that we're in. That's what we have to do every day. We have to do it all over the world.\nIf you think about that and how we're doing about kind of quality at scale in multiple cultures and multiple regions, I look at this last quarter, you see Fool Me Once, One Day, The Gentlemen, Scoop, the super buzzy Baby Reindeer, all that from the UK, all in the last few months. Berlin, Society of the Snow, Alpha Males, all from Spain and all just in the last few months. That's been, you know, one of those things that we just keep building and building and building on. Local unscripted, which is a fairly new initiative for us, and we're finding huge success with things like our second season of Physical 100 in Korea recently, and Love is Blind Sweden.\nThese are all kind of hard to replicate things that we keep getting better and better at every day, that we're really proud of the teams for doing that. Remember, engagement captures all of this, and none of that's possible without great tech and product. We need to do both.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, I think that's right. I mean, the fundamental is all those amazing series, film, games, live events, but a key component of our success, and something that we're seeking to get constantly better at, is that ability to find audiences for all those great titles. Part of making that happen is just the number of people who look to us for entertainment. We mentioned over half a billion people in this letter. Part of that is that product we do to effectively connect those folks with titles that they will love, which then enables us to find the largest audiences for those titles that we think that they could get anywhere. I think, as you've mentioned, Ted, this applies globally to titles from all over the world, which is super exciting.\nWe seek to maximize the fandom and the impact on the conversation and the cultural zeitgeist that all those titles have. When we do that well, that just feeds positively into that cycle as we launch new titles. You know, in terms of what are we doing better, what do we do better, we seek to get better at all of those things. If we can make that whole flywheel spin a little bit faster, then that's great for our members, it's great for our titles, and it's great for our creators.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Ted and Greg. Moving us along, we have Barton Crockett from Rosenblatt. There's a question about our revenue guidance, so I will direct this question to Spencer. Spencer, can you please explain what drives the revenue deceleration for the full year? Thirteen to 15% revenue growth for the full year compared with the 15 to 16% growth in the first and second quarters of this year. Secondly, he also has a question about second quarter subscriber growth. Will that be higher or lower than Q2 of 2023?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nAll right. Sure. Well, thanks for the question. First, regarding revenue growth overall, full year outlook, I feel really good about where we are in our growth outlook. I just want to be clear about that. We've done a lot of hard work over the past 18 months or so to re-accelerate the business and re-accelerate revenue through a combination of improving our core service, which Greg and Ted just talked about, rolling out pay-sharing, and launching our ads business. That re-acceleration really started in the back half of 2023, and it built through the year. Our growth in the back half of 2024 is really kind of comping off of those harder comps. At the high end of our revenue forecast, our growth in the second half is consistent with our growth in the first half, even with those tougher comps.\nYou know, it's still early in the year. We still got a lot to execute against. We also, as you see in our letter, there's been some effects that with the strengthening dollar, that's a bit of a headwind. We'll see where that goes throughout the year. You know, we're guiding a healthy double-digit revenue growth for the full year, which is what we set out to deliver. That's what's reflected in the range. You know, I guess maybe it's in the question, I guess, seated in this is a little bit of like what's really kind of the outlook for our growth of the business, you know, not just the back half of this year, but into 2025. You know, it's too early to provide real specific guidance, but we're going to work hard to sustain healthy double-digit revenue growth for our business.\nWe really like the kind of the opportunity ahead of us. We're so small in every aspect. We're only 6% roughly of our revenue opportunity. We're less than 10% of TV share in every country in which we operate. There's still hundreds of millions of homes that are not Netflix members. We're just getting started on advertising. The key is to, as you just heard from Greg and Ted, continually improve our service, drive more engagement, more member value. As we do that, we'll have more members, we'll be able to occasionally price in that value, and also have a big, highly engaged audience for advertisers. More to come on '25 guidance, but we feel good about the outlook. I guess the second part of the question I'm trying to remember.\n\nOperator\n\nSpencer, I'm sorry.\nI'll be the bad guy on this one, Spencer. The second question was, do you expect Q2 subscriber growth to be higher or lower than Q2 of the prior year? Barton, as you know, we don't give formal subscriber guidance. We did give an indication in the letter for you that we expect fairly typical seasonality. Paid net ads in Q2 of this year will be lower than Q1 of this year, and that's the limit of the color we'll provide there.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nFirst of all, no problem, Spencer. To follow up on the revenue guidance question, we have Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer, who's asking for some more color on the drivers of the full year revenue guidance with respect to subscriber growth versus ARM growth, and how those two dynamics will play into the revenue forecast, Spencer.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah.\nDo you want me to take this one as well?\n\nOperator\n\nYeah.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nOkay.\nI'll jump in. Others can chime in as well. When you think about the outlook for the year, in terms of the mix of revenue growth, we expect it'll be pretty similar to what you see in Q1, where it's primarily driven by member growth because of the full year impact of pay-sharing rolling through the year, and continued strong acquisition and retention trends. We are seeing some ARM growth as well. We saw it in Q1, about 1% on a reported basis, 4% FX-neutral. You know, I just want to be clear, what's happening with ARM is price changes are going well. That's why we're seeing those strong acquisition and retention trends, because it's a testament to the strength of our slate, the overall improvement in the value of our service.\nWe've only really changed prices in a few big markets. That was US, UK, France late last year, and only on some of the plan tiers in those markets, not even all the plan tiers. Since then, it's been mostly pretty small countries other than Argentina. In Argentina, as you can see, we're sort of pricing into the local currency devaluation, and you see that in the difference between FX-neutral and reported growth in Q1. Mostly what you're seeing in our growth profile this year is the fact that we haven't taken pricing in most countries for the past two years, really. We also have some ARM kind of headwinds in the near term that you see in Q1.\nYou'll probably see throughout most of this year, which is that, you know, one, we have some of this planned mix shift as we roll out pay-sharing. While it's highly revenue accretive, as you can see in our numbers and our reported growth, strong reported growth in Q1 and outlook for the year, that growth, as we spin off into new paid memberships, they tend to spin off into a mix of plan tiers that's a little bit of a lower price skew than what we see in our tenured members. We're also growing our ads tier at a nice clip, as you've seen, I'm sure we'll talk about. Monetization is lagging growth there. I'm sure we'll talk about that a bit as well. We also have some country mix shifts.\nThat whole combination of factors results in pretty modest ARM growth, still some ARM growth, but pretty modest in Q1 and probably throughout the year. Again, the key there is that, you know, this is all we're kind of managing this business transition in a way that's really healthy for overall revenue growth, as you see with 15% reported revenue growth in the quarter, strong outlook for the year. We're building into a much more kind of durable and healthy foundation for revenue growth going forward across a larger base of paid members, and a really kind of strong and scaled, highly engaged audience for it to build into our advertising over time, and, you know, a strong pay-sharing solution and also to kind of penetrate into those households.\nWe'll increasingly kind of see that mix in our revenue growth, and we start to see some of it this year.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Spencer, the next question comes from Kanan Venkateshwar from Barclays. It's for you, which is, do you expect margin growth trajectory to continue being on the present path for a few years? Can you attain margins that are comparable to legacy media margins?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, thanks, Kanan. You know, our focus is on sustaining healthy revenue growth and growing margins each year. That's what we talk about a lot. We also talk about it in the letter. We feel good about what we've been delivering. You know, 21% margins last year, that's up from 18% in the year before. Now we're targeting 25% this year, which is up a tick from the start of the year when we were guiding to 24%. I'd say just like we have in the past, we'll take a disciplined approach to balancing margin improvement with investing into our growth. We've managed that balance historically pretty well: growing content investment, growing profit, growing profit margin, and growing cash flow. You should expect we'll continue to do that.\nThe amount of annual margin expansion in any given year could bounce around a bit with FX and other investment opportunities. Again, we're committed to grow margin each year, and we see a lot of runway to continue to grow profit and profit margin over the long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Spencer. Our next question comes from Alan Gould of Loop Capital. Which inning are we in with respect to enforcing pay-sharing? Two years ago, you said 100 million subscribers were sharing passwords with 30 million in UCAN. How many do you estimate still borrow passwords? I'll turn the floor over to Greg to answer that question.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, as we mentioned last quarter, we're at the point where we've operationalized the pay-sharing work. This is just now part of that standard mechanism that we've been building and iterating on over time to translate more entertainment value, and, you know, great film series, games, live events into revenue. Like we do with all of the significant parts of our product experience, we're iterating on that, testing it, improving it continually. Rather than thinking beyond, you know, sort of specific cohorts or specific numbers, we really think about this more as developing more mechanisms, more effective ways to convert folks who are interacting with us, whether they be borrowers or folks that were members before that are coming back. We call them rejoiners, or folks that have never been a Netflix member.\nWe want to find the right call to action, the right offer, the right nudge at the right time to get them to convert. Just to be clear, we still see opportunities to improve this process. We've got line of sight on several improvements to this value translation mechanism that we expect will deliver and contribute to business growth for the next several quarters to come. I also very much believe that just like for the last 15 years, you know, we've always found something to improve in this process. Even beyond those, for years and decades to come, we'll be working on this and making it better and better and better. All of those improvements could allow us to effectively get more of that 500 million plus smart TV households to sign up and become members.\nYou know, Spencer mentioned the hundreds of millions yet to come. This is a way to effectively get at more of those folks and make them part of our membership base. As we mentioned earlier on the call too, I think worth noting that while we're fully anticipating continuing to grow subs, you know, the overall business growth now has extra levers and extra drivers, like plan optimization, including things like extra members, ads revenue, pricing into more value, which is important. Those levers are also an increasingly important part of our growth model as well.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I'll move us on now to a series of questions around advertising, the first of which comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. What are the most important drivers of scaling your ad tier when you think about adjustments you could make to pricing and plans, partner bundles, and marketing? How do you get people over the hump for that a few minutes of ads an hour can still be a very good experience at the right price? Greg, why don't you take that one?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, all the things mentioned in the question matter. I would say we're generally taking our entire playbook, everything that we've learned about how do you grow members, and we're applying it to our ads tier now. Clearly that means partner channels, device integrations, bundles, integrated payments. Those are all important tools for growth, just as they are, and will continue to be, in our non-ads offering. Increasing awareness of the quality of our ads experience, especially relative to the linear TV ads experience, which in many countries is really quite poor, is an important iterative tool. When we talk about sort of marketing and awareness building, that's going to be part of our growth mechanism. You know, low price, that's important to consumers. $6.99 is an example in the United States for multiple streams, full HD downloads.\nWe think that's a great entertainment value, especially at the industry-leading low ad load that we've got. That's critical as well. I think you can see the results of leveraging all of these mechanisms and more, and how our ads tier has been scaling over the last couple of quarters. We're 65% up quarter to quarter this last quarter. That's after two quarters of about 70% quarter-over-quarter growth. For me, it's exciting to see that growth rate stay high, even as we've grown the base so much, because obviously the numbers indicate that that means that there's more absolute additions each quarter. We're making good progress there. Look, you know, we've got much, much more to do in terms of scaling. We've got more to do in terms of effective go-to-market, more technical features, more ads products.\nThere's, you know, plenty of work ahead for us on ads.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Greg, our next question on advertising comes from Rich Greenfield of Lightshed. He has a three-part question. Part one, can you update us on your thinking around the optimal spread between the ad tier and the ad-free tier? Secondly, is your advertising ARPU, excluding the subscription fee, up meaningfully versus your original comments that it was in the 8 to $9 range last year? Lastly, can you give us a sense of what ARPU would look like if supply was not outstripping demand?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, I'll take the first one and then maybe hand the ARPU/ARM points to Spencer. We don't have a fixed a priori position on sort of the optimal pricing spread. Much like we've done with price changes in general, we really use signals from our customers, things like plan take rate, conversion rates, churn, to guide us along an iterative path to get to that right pricing. I think it's also probably worth noting that sort of right pricing is not really a static position. As we continue to evolve and improve our offering, that's going to change as well. I think a good general guideline for us in the long term is that it would be healthy for us to land overall monetization between our ads and non-ads offerings in roughly an equivalent position.\nThat really comes down to, you know, what works best for any given member. It's really a member choice about which plan they think serves them the best. I'll hand it over to Spencer on ARM questions.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nSure. Thanks, Greg. In terms of ARM and your question, Rich, in terms of how we're doing now relative to what we discussed when we first launched the business, you know, as Greg said, we've been growing our inventory at quite a fast clip. Monetization hasn't fully kept up with that growth and scale and inventory as we're still early in building out our sales capabilities and our ad products. That is an opportunity for us because we're still a very premium content environment, a very highly engaged audience that's at an increasing scale. Our CPMs remain strong, and we're building out our capabilities, as Greg talked about. The revenue is going to follow engagement over time, and it's already kind of growing nicely, which is great just off a small base.\nAs Greg said, what that means for ARM is right now it is a bit of a drag on our ARM because we're kind of undermonetizing relative to supply. Over time, we expect to be similar in revenue on our ads tier, a combination of subscription as well as ads revenue, with those kind of non-ads offerings. That's how to think about it, but we're building to it over time.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Last question on advertising comes from John Hudlick at UBS. How are you approaching this year's upfronts? Do you believe the base of ad support users is now of the scale that upfront commitments can drive a meaningful change in advertising revenue and be a contributor to ARM growth in 2025? Perhaps, Ted, maybe you could start and then Greg follow after that.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, of course. First and foremost, this is our second upfronts. We're really excited to go and share with advertisers this incredible slate that we're very, very proud of. They're going to get a look at some of the shows that are upcoming right away, like brand new seasons of Bridgerton, Sweet Tooth, and That '90s Show, some of our big unscripted events upcoming, like our Tom Brady roast by way of example, and brand new shows like Dead Boy Detectives and Shane Gillis' new show, Tires. Eric, a great new limited series out of the UK with Benedict Cumberbatch that we're super excited about. They'll even get a longer look at what's coming up in the second half of the year, which is, again, returning seasons of Cobra Kai, Emily in Paris, The Night Agent, Outer Banks, and Squid Game, our big one.\nA brand new season of Monsters from Ryan Murphy, which is the Lyle and Eric Menendez story this year, is going to be a really incredible thing to share with our advertisers. Brand new original series and limited series like American Primeval from Pete Berg, Heartburn with an all-star cast, Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber, Senna, which is this great limited series on the great Brazilian Formula One driver, are ones we're really excited about. I look at our early movies coming up that we'll end the year with, like Eddie Murphy in his most iconic role, Axel Foley, in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley, Carry On, a big new animated feature, Spellbound. We've got a lot of entertainment in store for the audience at the upfronts.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, I think this is an opportunity to reengage with advertisers and look at the fundamentals of what our offering is. I mean, first and foremost, you know, it's an incredible list of titles that brands want to be connected with. It's just super exciting to hear that roster. We've got great engagement from our members on our ads tier, and we've got an opportunity to grow that even further. We think that's connected again to the power of those titles. We're rapidly growing scale, as we mentioned. That's the number one request we've had from advertisers, which is exciting. We're making progress on technical features like measurement on ads products, so we're excited to get that out there.\nReally, this is just an opportunity to bring all of that progress in a package to advertisers and then, of course, to get input from them because we know that they're going to have comments, and they're going to have things that they're going to want us to continue to work on. Then really just to continue that journey because we know there's plenty more to go do to realize the potential we have in this space. I would say, you know, we're continuing to grow here. We're growing off of a relatively small base in terms of the impact against an already big and substantial business. Even though it's growing quite quickly, you know, it takes a while to grow that into the point where it's material.\nWe look forward to that increasing in 2025 and then, you know, increasing further in 2026 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I'll now transition us to several questions around content. This first one I'll direct to Ted. It's a rare question around why don't we spend more? Given what seems like a very favorable current backdrop for Netflix to acquire and license content, why not lean in even more aggressively? Could it make sense to spend more than $17 billion in cash content this year?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, independent of the availability of licensed content, you should look at it. I think we've always been very disciplined about the way we invest in the business and how we grow it. We can get a lot of bang for our buck by spending our money well, producing our shows really well, and also by acquiring the right content. The floodgates have opened a little more on licensing for sure. Again, we're very focused on the ones that we think will drive the business. I think we're at our current level of spending and our current rate of growth, and we're pretty comfortable spending just behind that anticipated rate of growth.\n\nOperator\n\nTed, Jason Helfstein's follow-up is also about licensed content or second-run content. His question is, how would more second-run licensing impact your margins and free cash flow?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, the budget is the budget. It's all part of how we spend against the content. The free cash flow economics, you know, we've gotten pretty close in our cash flow against P&L on our content spend generally. I don't think we'd have very much impact on that, especially when I add some color to that, Spencer.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nI just love you talking about the discipline on our content budgets, Ted. It makes me happy. No, I agree with all of it. I mean, yeah, we spend the opportunity, but with, I think, prudent constraints and discipline. To be clear, like you say, there has been more licensed content opportunity, but the vast majority of our content spend is still into original programming. It is and is likely to continue to be. We'll always complement it with great licensed content for that variety and quality for our members. The original content is still our future too. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Next question is from Michael Morris of Guggenheim, specific about the Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight. For Ted, what are the characteristics of the upcoming Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight that make this the type of sports programming you're interested in investing in?\nHow does that content benefit your member base and advertising growth goals?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, we're in the very early days of developing our live programming. I would look at this as an expansion of the types of content we offer, the way we expanded to film, unscripted, animation, and most recently, games. On-demand and streaming have been unbelievable for consumer choice and control. It's really put the controls of television back in the hands of consumers, which has been really phenomenal. There's also something incredibly magic about folks gathering around the TV together in the living room to watch something all at the same time. We believe that these kind of eventized cultural moments, like the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight, are just that kind of television that we want to be part of, winning over those moments with our members as well. That for me is the excitement part of this.\nBeyond the fight itself, you know, we have several nights of live comedy coming from the Netflix Is a Joke Festival next month. Starting in January, we've got 52 weeks of live sports with WWE Raw that's going to be coming to our members every week on Netflix. We think it's going to be a real value add to watch those things in real time. We're going to continue to try a lot of new things. The core of it is, do our members love it? Judging from the early excitement around the Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight, there's going to be a lot of people waking up in the middle of the night all over the world to watch this fight in real time.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nI think worth noting that, you know, just as what's relevant to members in terms of these, you know, large cultural events that Ted talks about, that's what has relevance to advertisers as well. It's an opportunity for us to expand our advertising offering and give those brands access to these kind of culture-defining moments.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Ted and Greg. I'm personally looking forward to that event. My money is on Iron Mike Tyson. As a follow-up on the sports.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nBold. Bold.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, he still got it, I think. As a follow-up to the sports question for Ted, as you continue to scale Netflix and become bigger and bigger and potentially gain more leverage, how could your sports strategy change beyond what you're doing today around primarily sports entertainment?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, you know, we've said this many times, but you know, not anti-sports, but pro-profitable growth. I think that's the core of everything we do in all kinds of programming, including sports. Our North Star is to grow engagement, revenue, and profit. If we find opportunities that we could drive all three of those, we will do that across an increasingly wide variety of quality entertainment. When and if those opportunities arrive that we can come in and do that, which we feel like we did in our deal with WWE, if we can repeat those dynamics in other things, including sports, we'll look at them for sure. You know, I think we've had the benefit of building an enormous business without a lost leader. We continue to believe that we can grow on that path, just as you've seen.\nI think the core of it is that we're going to look at those opportunities with the same discipline that we do when we talk to movie producers and television networks about putting our content on the air.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. The next question comes from Rich Greenfield from Lightshed about our film strategy. For Ted, a recent New York Times article cited internal communications from new Netflix film chief Dan Lin, stating, the aim is to make Netflix's movies better, cheaper, and less frequent. Lin wants his team to become more aggressive producers, developing their own material rather than waiting for projects from producers and agents that come to them. Everyone wants to make better, cheaper films, but we find it hard to believe, we being Rich, find it hard to believe that there is a magic formula. Help us understand the strategy shift under Dan Lin versus Scott Stuber.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, thanks for that question, Rich. I would send you back to that New York Times article because that was not a quote from Dan. I would say that, nor did we participate in that article. I would say just to be clear, there is no appetite to make fewer films. There is an unlimited appetite to make better films always. Even though we have made and we are making great films, we want to make them better, of course. We're super excited to have Dan join the company. He just joined a couple of weeks ago, and he's joined us running 100 miles an hour. You know, Bella has said this publicly that our strategy remains variety and quality, and she's doing an amazing job of bringing new, fresh thinking to our content and our content organization.\nBringing Dan on board is a great example of that. We want to have a lot of movies, we want them to thrill our audiences, and they all have different tastes. We want them all to be great. You know, we take a very audience-centric view of what quality is. Dan knows that from having produced for us. As CEO of Rideback, you know, he produced the Oscar-nominated film The Two Popes for us. He did Avatar: The Last Airbender for us recently. He understands Netflix and the audience really, really well, and his success in live action and animation is very hard to find in the business. We're thrilled he's doing it here.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ted. The next question comes from Kanan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Could you please provide an update on engagement trends now that pay-sharing is mostly behind you? I'll kick it over to Ted first. Greg, you can feel free to add on.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nWell, it's important to note that we compete for every hour of viewing all the time, every day, everywhere we operate. We think that that engagement report is very important, and that metric's important because, again, it's the best indicator of customer satisfaction. I know I just said this 10 minutes ago, but I'm going to repeat it. Eight of the first 11 weeks of this year, we've had the number one movie, and nine of the last 11 weeks of this year, we've had the number one series. That's according to the Nielsen Streaming Data. For us, that is what we're singly focused on. We've actually seen in that Nielsen Data our share tick up a little bit, even in this incredibly competitive space where you've got a lot of folks competing for attention, for time, and for money.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, Ted, I think you can repeat that 8, 11, 9, 11 as many times as you want as far as I'm concerned.\nI'm going to close with a two.\nYou know, as we have said, you know, due to the work that we've been doing on password sharing, we're essentially cutting off some viewers who are not payers. Therefore, we're going to lose some viewing associated with that. When you see our next engagement report, you are going to see some impact to our overall absolute view hours as a result of that. Despite that impact, and despite the general pressure from strong competition that Ted noted, we think our engagement remains healthy. You can see it in the stat that Ted indicated in terms of the Nielsen ratings, and our modest growth in TV time in the United States. We also wanted to do an apples-to-apples view of engagement, so we looked at the population non-impacted by pay-sharing, what we called owner households.\nIn Q1 of 2024, the hours viewed per account were steady with the year-ago quarter. That's a pretty good sign that our engagement's holding up. It sort of cuts through the noise around pay-sharing. Again, I just want to reiterate, we think we have plenty of room to grow engagement, right? We're still less than 10% of TV hours, even in our most mature markets. There's tons of room of growth ahead of us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Ted and Greg. I'm going to move us along now to a series of questions around plans, pricing, and pricing strategy. From Steve Kahl from Wells Fargo: Greg, as you continue to expand, do you think there is a ceiling for pricing? If so, how close are we to that ceiling in mature markets?\nDo you envision Netflix having content tier so that you can continue to expand your content genres and further segment your customer base?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, we don't have a set position on a ceiling. I mean, sure, you can look at pay TV as a potential markers for, you know, where people have spent before. We really actually don't think of it so much as defined by that. We see it as an opportunity to continue the process that we've been working on, which is let's continue to try and invest wisely, add more entertainment value, and as we add more entertainment value, then, of course, we can go back to our subscribers and ask them to pay a little bit more to keep that virtuous cycle moving.\nReally, the markers for us in terms of the upside potential more are around, you know, the hours on TV that we are winning, you know, how many moments of truth, we call it, that we are winning. Again, you know, less than 10%. In our even most mature markets, there's tons of room there. You can use total consumer spend on entertainment in the markets and categories that we compete in. That's, you know, between 5% and 6%. There is just a lot of runway still ahead of us to go do a good job at making that investment happen, deliver more value, and then, you know, ask folks to pay a little bit more.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat.Next question on pricing comes from March Mulick of Bernstein. Can you please share progress on how the retirement of a basic plan is going in the UK and Canada?\nIs there any color you can share on if or when we could expect a similar rollout in the US? Greg, why don't you take that one?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYep. As we shared in the Q4 2023 letter, we were planning on retiring our basic plan in some of our ads countries. We've now started that process in Canada and the UK. Very similar to what you saw us do with pay-sharing, we're going to work hard to make this a smooth transition. Part of that is listening to our members before we make any further moves. We've got nothing, you know, more to announce. We really want to see how this goes. Yeah, we know that this is a change for our basic members, but we think we've got a strong offering for them. They're going to get more for less, two streams versus one.\nWe've got higher definition, we've got downloads, all at a lower price. Of course, you know, it goes without saying, hopefully, that members can always choose our ads-free plans as well if they prefer.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat, thank you, Greg. A couple of questions on overall capital allocation. These would be for spencer primarily from John Blackledge of TD Cowen. Excuse me. You mentioned evolving capital allocation strategy in your investor letter with your new investment grade status. Can you please talk about changes and how investors will see that change?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question. It's really quite a modest evolution of our capital allocation strategy to better reflect our investment grade status, and that's really what it is.\nIt's, you know, we're still going to have the same financial policies and principles in terms of prioritizing profitable growth by reinvesting in our core business, maintaining a healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity, and returning excess cash beyond several billion dollars on the balance sheet of minimum cash, and, you know, anything that we use for selective M&A to return to shareholders through share repurchase. Really, the only change is that now that we're solidly investment grade, you know, while we will hold still several billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet, we won't have the same marker of two months of revenue, the equivalent of two months of revenue on the balance sheet. It allows us to be a bit more efficient there.\nWe also upsized our revolver, which was announced today, up to $3 billion from $1 billion, which also gives us more access to capital and better cash efficiency. Any cash beyond that will return to shareholders. We've historically been mostly a build versus buy company, with select strategic kind of acceleration through M&A. You know, there's nothing right now planned, but that still is kind of our philosophy, to build predominantly. You know, we're also going to kind of refinance our existing kind of debt as those maturities approach. We don't plan to kind of lever up through stock buyback. We really do value that balance sheet flexibility. Great.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Spence. Last question on capital allocation for you. This comes from Vikram of Baird. What are your latest thoughts on the appropriate level of content spend for the business beyond 2024?\nSpecifically, in the past, you have referenced a 1.1 cash content spend to amortization ratio. Is that still the case? What would you need to see in an opportunity to meaningfully exceed that framework?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYou know, it still holds. It still holds. We're still basically, the short of it is we're really kind of managing to that. As we said, we've been focused on driving that acceleration of our revenue growth, continuing to grow our business, grow our profitability. As we do that, we would expect to continue to grow our content investment as we have historically into the highest impact areas, but also be quite disciplined there. We want to grow our free cash flow. We believe we can manage to that roughly 1.1x of cash content spend relative to expense on the P&L. That leads to overall revenue growth, increased profit, profit margins, and growing free cash flow.\nThat still gives us a lot of opportunity to spend into the, you know, all those kind of content and entertainment categories thats Greg and Ted have been talking about.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Spence. We have a few more minutes left, so we'll wrap up with a few higher-level questions. The next one comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. I think both Ted and Greg can tackle this one. The question is, what are your thoughts on the competitive impact from short-form video consumption?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nI look at how what people watch and when they watch it have a lot to do with one another. What are the choices, and how much time do they have? Our version of short-form is more like giving our members the ability to watch 10 minutes of an episode of a series that they're binging right now if they only have 10 minutes. Also, when I look at the short-form viewing on YouTube and TikTok, some of it is adjacent and quite complementary to our viewing. Our trailers or creators expressing their fandom for our shows, like posting a Wednesday dance or ugly crying watching One Day, all those kinds of things become viral sensations and actually increase the fandom of our shows.\nNow, that being said, some of that viewing is directly competitive with us, the same as it is with other media companies who provide content to YouTube by way of example. The art of this has always been finding the right balance of both. I also would point out that these platforms have been a way to have new voices emerge. We've got our eye on them as well to try to develop them into the next generation of great storytellers on Netflix.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I think for our final question, we'll take that from Dan Salmon of New Street Research. What is the opportunity for Netflix to leverage generative AI technology in the near and long term? What do you think great storytellers should be focused on as this technology continues to emerge quickly? I'll turn that over to Greg, please.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix Inc.\n\nYeah, worth noting, I think that we've been leveraging advanced technologies like ML for almost two decades. These technologies are the foundation for our recommendation systems that help us find, you know, these largest audiences for our titles, and deliver the most satisfaction for our members. We're excited to continue to involve and improve those systems as new technologies emerge and are developed.\nWe also think we're well positioned to be in the vanguard of adoption and application of those new approaches from our, you know, our just general capabilities that we've developed and how we've already developed systems that do all these things. We also think that we have the opportunity to develop and deliver new tools to creators to allow them to tell their stories in even more compelling ways. That's great for them, it's great for the stories, and it's great for our members. What should storytellers be focused on? I think storytellers should be focused on great storytelling. It is incredibly hard and incredibly complex to deliver thrilling stories through film, through series, through games. Storytellers have a unique and critical role in making that happen, and we don't see that changing.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Greg. We are now out of time.\nI want to thank you all for taking the time to listen into our earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you.",

Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Neumann. We do have a few changes to our interview format this quarter. First, we are live streaming this over YouTube, so hopefully it's working. I guess we'll find out shortly enough. Second, we've collected questions from the analyst community, and I'll be reading those questions and moderating the interviewer. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, let's dive first into the first set of questions, which is about our new partnership with WWE that we announced this morning. For Ted, the first question comes from Dan Salmon. Can you please expand on the decision to acquire WWE Raw rights? Is the WWE audience one that is underpenetrated for Netflix today?\nCan you expand on the economics or the cost of the deal, please?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks, Dan. If I could raise a single eyebrow at a time, I would lean into the camera with the single eyebrow and do my best, Dwayne. I am going to say instead that we are thrilled to bring this WWE live programming to our members around the world. WWE Raw is sports entertainment, which is right in the sweet spot of our sports business, which is the drama of sport. Think of this as 52 weeks of live programming every year. It feeds our desire to expand our live event programming. Most importantly, fans love it. For decades, the WWE has grown this multi-generational fan base that we believe we could serve and we can grow.\nWe believe that WWE has been historically underdistributed outside of North America. This is a global deal, so we can help them and they can help us build that fandom around the world. I should add that this should also add some fuel to our new and growing ad business. We're very excited about this deal.\n\nOperator\n\nTed, did you want to comment on the economics or the cost of the deal?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo, we don't comment on the economics of any of our deals. I would just say this is a long-term deal that we're really happy to be in with the WWE.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield of Lightshed. Rich first wants me to say great quarter.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nOf course, he does.\n\nOperator\n\nHis question is, should we think about the WWE deal as fitting into your existing plans to spend roughly $17 billion US dollars a year on programming, or is this expansion into live going to drive overall spending higher? Lastly, could you talk about the opportunities to create shoulder programming around WWE similar to Drive to Survive?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, expanding into live event programming is something we've talked about for quite a while, and this has been in the works. We used to look at this as fits inside of our $17 billion US dollars programming spend now. In terms of building on it, you should think about Formula 1 as this is almost the inverse of Formula 1, which is a very big and passionate US fan base and a lot of room to grow outside of the US. We could build that as we have with Formula 1 and other sports through our shoulder programming, like Drive to Survive, like Full Swing, like Break Point, like Quarterback, like Tour de France. Now with this great storytelling, the events itself are the storytelling of the WWE. This is a proven formula for us that we're excited to jump into.\nThis is sports entertainment, very close to our core. The deal's long-term, we're super excited about it.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. The WWE partnership has spurred a lot of questions around our broader approach to sports, including a question from Ben Swinburne, but I'll read Michael Nathanson's question since he got it in first. Ted, given the news today, is it safe to presume that you will now be interested in similar types of global sports rights like the NBA or UFC? Why is the WWE more attractive than those rights?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nUnique to those other opportunities, WWE is sports entertainment. It's really as close to our core as you can get of that sports storytelling. In terms of the deal itself, it has options and has the protections that we seek in our general licensing deals, and with economics that we're super happy with globally. I would not look at this as a signal of any other change or any change to our sports strategy.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ted. I'll move us along now to a series of questions regarding our results and the forecast. First, coming from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. This is for Spencer. How should we think about ARM growth going forward? Is mid-single-digit percentage increase a reasonable benchmark? What are the factors that could create either upside or downside to that growth outlook?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure, sure. Thanks, Mark. Well, first, stepping back, 2023, as a reminder, was a pretty unusual year for us. It was essentially all member-driven growth because our pricing and plans' focus in 2023 was on rolling out paid sharing. We had almost no price increases until late in the year in 2023, and even then it was just a partial quarter impact. As we look to 2024, as we noted in the letter for 2024, we expect healthy double-digit FX-neutral revenue growth, including growth in FX-neutral ARM. We expect continued member growth powered by a great slate, including the full year impact of our 2023 net adds carrying into 2024. No change to our pricing philosophy. You saw some of that pricing action already in the past quarter. We should get some help from extra members and starting to scale our ads business.\nAs we said, ads won't be a primary driver in 2024. When we look beyond, in general over multiple years, 2024 and beyond, we're focused on continually improving our service. If we do that well, we'll have more members, we'll have more value that we can occasionally price into, and lots of engagement to build a big and profitable ads business. Healthy revenue growth with a mixture of volume and ARM, that's really the output. I'll probably disappoint because I'm not going to provide a specific guide on ARM because we manage overall revenue growth, but we want ARM to be a component of that growth.\nIt's just that it could move up or down based on things in any given year, like FX, like the pace at which we're scaling our ads reach, and some lag that could happen in terms of monetizing that reach, and just generally our pricing and plan strategy more broadly in a given year.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Spencer. Our next question is from Steve Cahall from Wells Fargo for Greg. The question is, once subscriber and ARM benefits from paid sharing begin to diminish in 2024, what do you think are the biggest incremental opportunities to continue to drive subscriber and revenue growth? What types of additional content or additional member benefits provide the best ROI to help sustain healthy revenue growth?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, we're excited to be at the point where we've operationalized that paid sharing product work. It's integrated in everything we do, and we're iterating and improving on it just like we would any other significant part of our product experience. We think of this essentially as having built a more effective engine for translating the entertainment value that we're creating for our members into revenue. I think it's critical to understand that that engine works on top of, and we see it working on top of, very healthy organic growth. You can see it in things like better than forecasted churn. We see better than expected impacts in the recent price changes we did. That's the model, essentially, right? If we continue to improve our core offering, that means more diversity and more quality from our members' perspective and our films and series.\nNow adding the live events programming to add even more value, continue to grow gains in the entertainment value that we're delivering through those. Our paid sharing work and our ads work creates a more effective engine to translate all that value into revenue growth, and will support increased conversion of our addressable market in many years to come.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Greg. The next question is from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan, and I'll direct this one to Spencer. The 13 million-plus paid net adds in Q4 was strong overall and across all regions, but to me, it seemed to drive particular upside. Is there anything specific to point out there, perhaps the ad tier, or specific content, or localized pricing, perhaps?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, thanks. Well, actually, EMEA is sort of a perfect example of a little bit of what Greg was just talking about. First, it starts with great slate performance, a great content performance. We had a really strong slate across EMEA, from The Crown finale in the UK to, in France, we had Blood Coast, Lupin, and Class Act. We had Berlin, Elite, and Nowhere in Spain, and in Poland, 1670, and much more, frankly. It starts with that strong slate. If I channel Greg's last answer, that kind of better value translation engine, if you will, drives even more growth through our paid sharing solutions and our monetization engine. That helped as well. It really all came together in EMEA this past quarter. I'll say, very importantly, it's not just net adds.\nAgain, our primary focus is on revenue growth. We had very strong revenue growth as a result of that in EMEA this past quarter, 13% FX-neutral growth in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Spencer. Doug also has a follow-up question around paid sharing, which I will direct to Greg. How far along are you in terms of the paid sharing benefits? Do you still believe paid sharing will add subscribers for several more quarters? Is there any way to quantify what percentage of the 100 million borrower household population have either become extra members or full-paying subscribers?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, as I mentioned, we've gotten to the point where paid sharing, the paid sharing product experience, is just something we do at this point. I think it's important to say that, like many other things that we do, we also see a real opportunity to continue to materially improve that value translation engine. We definitely delivered interventions to new cohorts in the last quarter. We're going to continue to deliver to new cohorts in 2024. Increasingly, I sort of don't think about it as going after these certain pools, but more about just finding the most effective way to convert folks who are using the service, the right call to action, the right nudge at the right time. Those might have been historical borrowers or folks that are new to the service as well. We're going to continue to improve that engine.\nThat will continue to improve our growth for years ahead, not just 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I'll now transition us to a series of questions around advertising. For Greg, Dan Salmon from New Street Research, his question is, what are some of your most important milestones for the advertising business in 2024? Do you have a target level of MAUs or ad member households? What sorts of improvements to ad tech or measurement are you seeking, and perhaps any new country launches for your ads plan?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, our top ads priority, you've heard us say before, I think you'll hear us say it again, is scale. We saw 70% quarter-to-quarter growth last quarter. That's after 70% quarter-to-quarter for the quarter before, and then 100% the quarter before that. That's a good trajectory to be on. We're now at 23 million MAUs, and we see that continuing to grow in the quarters ahead. As to your point about what's the target, every market's different. There's not a magic MAU number, but I think it's fair to say that we've still got plenty of room to grow in all the markets that we operate in. We're focused on the additional work that we can do in that space. That means making the ads plan more attractive. We've added streams, higher resolution, and downloads. It means engaging partner channels.\nYou'll see us do more of that, shifting our plans and pricing structure in other places where we think it's appropriate. All that works ahead of us. We know we can do tremendous amounts in that space, and we're going to go do it over the next quarters. Second priority, you mentioned this, which is really growing the technical advertising features and growing our go-to-market capabilities. These are features like targeting, improved ad relevance. That's good for members, it's good for brands. We've got tons to do on improved measurement. We want to launch more ads products. We've got binge ad sponsorships now. We have to build increasingly the capability to be better partners with advertisers and serve their needs. This is better sales teams, ad operations, and just more capability to meet brands where they need us and how they need us.\nWe're focused on the long-term revenue potential here. We're very optimistic about it. It's a huge opportunity. $180 billion US dollars of ad spend, ex-China and Russia, $25 billion US dollars alone on connected TV. We know ad dollars follow engagement. We've got the most engaged audience, so we believe we're well positioned to capture some of that ad spend that shifts from linear to streaming.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Greg, any thoughts to Dan's question around launching an ads plan in other countries in addition to the 12 countries we're in today?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks for reminding me on that one. I would say we've got a ton of work ahead of us on just getting to the level of maturity and impact to the business from the countries that we're operating in today. I would say never say never on expanding beyond that, but it's worth noting that the countries that we are currently operating in represent about 80% of global ad spend. We're already working in the spaces where there's the majority of opportunity. We'll see in the fullness of time, but I'd say we've got years of work ahead of us to take the ads business to the point where it's a material impactor to our general business.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you, Greg. From Steve Cahall from Wells Fargo, how do you think about the efficacy of continuing to use a third-party relationship for ad sales versus the opportunity to invest in your own ad tech and ad sales infrastructure? Do you have a sense of what kind of investment would be required to transact more directly with advertisers?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Just to clarify, we're already in partnership with Microsoft developing part of the technology that supports our ads experience. They've got a large team working on some of those features that I just mentioned, but we've got a smaller but growing team working on the areas where we can differentially contribute to. Similarly, on the ad sales and the go-to-market side of things, we're building out our own teams that cover a portion of the sales and operations activities. I think you asked in terms of what's the size of investment. We have plans to continue to grow those teams. Those are both growing at a pretty strong clip and growing that investment. We've modeled out what we think we need.\nEven with those investment levels and the growth that we see, we expect the margins on the ad business to remain very high.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thanks, Greg. A question from Rich Greenfield on advertising. Later this week, T-Mobile's subscriber benefit called Netflix On Us will convert to Netflix's ad tier unless subscribers upgrade to an ad-free tier. Is it reasonable to assume that your US ad-supported subscriber base will roughly double as a result of this change? Assuming it is, how quickly will you be able to fill that inventory?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I won't get into the specifics of a particular deal or provide a forecast for a particular deal, but I'll just say that just as we've done for many, many years, leveraging partner channels is an important part of our subscriber growth strategy. We're applying the same techniques and approaches to scaling our ads membership. We love having this additional tool. It's very effective, very useful for us because that lower consumer-facing price means that we got room now to bundle the ads plan into a set of lower-priced partner offerings where it was hard to make the economics work for everyone previously. It opens up a whole new range of opportunities. It's great for new members as well who are leveraging those bundles. They get a better plan than basic, more streams, higher resolution, with downloads.\nOf course, the real benefit is they get access to all this amazing stories at a lower effective price through the bundle. We really think of this as a win-win-win, and we're going to continue to leverage these bundles going forward. I think Rich asked how we think about how quickly can we fill the supply. I mean, when you're growing as fast as we're growing right now, it creates a lot of challenges you might expect to then fill behind that. I'd much rather be in that position where we're growing that inventory and then racing behind to fill it and improve our monetization than the reverse. I'm happy to have that challenge.\n\nOperator\n\nSuper. I'll now move us along to a series of questions related to content. Ted, from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer, are you shifting the mix of your content spend to more licensed second-run content? If so, how should we think about this mix impacting Netflix's operating margins?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe've always had a healthy appetite for licensing content from others for our members. I don't see any meaningful change in that mix. The current margin outlook contemplates that healthy mix between originals and licensed titles. It might be that we can deliver more on our programming spend with some licensed titles, but we also believe that we deliver an incredible amount of value, excitement, and differentiation with our original series. Remember, our original series made up the number one most-watched original 48 of 52 weeks last year. We really don't have any plans to move away from those investments.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Another question for you, Ted, from Rich on content. While Netflix data clearly shows that new original movies outperform licensed titles in terms of viewers and view hours, it doesn't appear that those new movies are having the same cultural impact that TV series have. Do the recent management departures or the willingness of Hollywood studios to license post-theatrical movies on Netflix signal any sort of meaningful shift in our film strategy towards licensing away from original production?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. No, look at it. Our original movies are attracting some of the biggest audiences in the world. Look at Leave the World Behind in Q4. Look at all those crazy memes about the creepy deers that were all over the place when that movie came out. Look at Society of the Snow from Spain right now. This morning was nominated for two Oscars. Even look back to last year. Jennifer Lopez's great movie, The Mother. By some accounts, it was the most-watched movie in the world last year. I think about it that fans really do not care much about budgets and windows. They just want a movie that they love. They want a movie to make them cry, make them laugh, or give them something great to talk about over dinner.\nAs you point out, our original films do outperform those licensed films, and they do uniquely distinguish us from the competition. Just this morning, our original films got 18 Oscar nominations across 10 different films. We do not plan to change our strategy or the mix. It's always going to be that kind of blend of first window, second window, and deep catalog. We think that formula works best to entertain the world.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. As a follow-up to that question around licensing, Ted, your competitors have largely abandoned their opposition to licensing catalog content. In Netflix, we've seen, for example, NBC Suits, HBO's Six Feet Under, and more recently, a series of Disney TV titles on Netflix. Do you think your competitors should begin licensing their new original series as well versus keeping them exclusively to their own streaming services?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I mean, I guess I'd call you back to that history again and just say we've got a rich history of helping break some of TV's biggest hits like Breaking Bad and Walking Dead, or even more recently with Schitt's Creek. Because of our recommendation and our reach, we can resurrect a show like Suits and turn it into a big pop culture moment, but also generate billions of hours of joy for our members. I think we've got to remember the studios have always been in the business of selling their content to others, including direct competitors for years. I believe because, again, of our distribution heft and our recommendation system, that sometimes we can uniquely add more value to the studio's IP than they can. Not all the time, but sometimes it does, and we're the best buyer for it.\nI am thrilled that the studios are more open to licensing again, and I'm thrilled to tell them that we are open for business.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. A question on animation and animated features from Rich Greenfield as well. For Ted, is Leo, Netflix's most successful animated film to date? It's been heavily watched based on our top 10 data. Is there any color you can provide on repeat viewing of the film, and why has this animated feature film resonated versus other Netflix animated feature films?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think Leo has resonated for the same reason that The Sea Beast did last year. It's great. People really love it. It brings a lot of joy to families. Yes, they do watch him over and over again, which drives a lot of engagement, but also drives a lot of attachment. I think that Leo and The Sea Beast are proof points that we have the flywheel to create original IP in that animated space, and there is so much appetite for animated feature. Seven of the top 10 most-watched movies, since Nielsen's been tracking streaming, are animated features. I'm super thrilled with Leo. We're kicking around Leo 2 right now, and it's a film that works on so many levels. The art of the animation is beautiful, the comedy is funny, and families just really love it. We look forward to a lot more.\nWe have Spellbound coming up next year. We're just really thrilled that the animation team is now firing on all cylinders.\n\nOperator\n\nMoving along to engagement, this question is from Brian Kraft of Deutsche Bank, and I'll direct this one to Ted. What have the engagement trends been like globally and domestically? Has it been steady, increasing, or decreasing? How has paid sharing impacted engagement per member?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe're really thrilled with our engagement trends domestically and globally. This is really a story about viewing moving from linear television to streaming. The story has been constant, and it continues. It's also a story about Netflix kind of leading the way with professional film and television, and now games. Our engagement is a bit impacted by our paid sharing. Think about it like fewer households using the same account. As those folks spin off and get their own accounts, and we win them over with our programming, that will normalize and continue to grow. We're really pleased with our engagement. We have shown you in graphic detail what that engagement looks like on a title-by-title basis in this engagement report we just released. I think you see in that report about two hours of daily engagement with our members, which is great.\nYou see that some of our hits and even our near hits are attracting enormous audiences. We have to keep pleasing them, and we have to do that in multiple languages, multiple countries, and all over the world. That's what we're excited about, and it's showing up in that engagement.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Let's move on to gaming. A couple of questions on gaming. First from Justin Patterson at KeyBank for Greg. The gaming portfolio expanded significantly last year and even added some more mainstream titles like Grand Theft Auto Trilogy. How are you thinking about sizing the investment in this area? How has engagement changed over the past year, and what are the signals you're evaluating to gauge when it's time to monetize?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Well, we're stoked by the performance of GTA. We had high hopes, but it exceeded even those high hopes. It's a great place to be. The biggest download and engagement numbers that we've seen so far, we were in the top mobile game downloads for several weeks, which shows it was not only big for us, but big numbers for mobile gaming in general. Beyond any specific title, we've tripled game engagement over the last year. That's a solid growth trajectory for us. Games, it's a huge opportunity, $140 billion US dollars in consumer spend ex China and Russia. We believe we can build games as a strong component, another content category to deliver entertainment value to our subscribers.\nTo your question on size of investment, we thought about this as we've got to allocate enough to the initiative to ensure that we're playing to win, that we have enough activity in the space that we're learning and growing, but also recognizing that we had a tremendous amount to learn and a tremendous set of institutional capabilities to develop. We wanted to make sure that we weren't growing that investment significantly before proving to ourselves that we can actually effectively translate that investment into member value. Things are going well if we continue to see this level of engagement growth, and we continue to see what we've been seeing so far, which is evidence, as we would expect, that that engagement leads to business benefits like increased retention. We'll be able to scale that investment appropriately.\nHaving said all of that, it's still, I'll use the early days words that we love to use, and it's worth noting that our games investment is a very small fraction of our overall content budget right now.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Greg, a second question on gaming from Michael Pachter of Wedbush. He asked, given the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Trilogy on the Netflix service, will you reconsider your focus on games available exclusively on the service, asking if you will seek to emulate the success of Grand Theft Auto by offering games like Candy Crush or Fortnite on Netflix as well?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYes. Licensing existing games, often with some form of exclusivity, has been a key part of our strategy, and it's going to continue to be so. We've clearly seen one of the things that we've learned is that recognizable games, that's either existing popular game titles or game franchises, or games that are based on well-known IP, and in many cases, that's IP from our own films and series, are the ones that are working the best for us right now. We're going to continue to find the right opportunities to bring those kinds of titles to our members.\nWe're going to look for more great licensing, and some exclusive licensing, so we can do things more like what you've seen us do last quarter with GTA, but also other titles like Football Manager 2024, which performed very well for us, Money Heist or Casa de Papel, which was great. You'll see it this quarter with titles like Virgin River. That's definitely the strategy that we're on, and you'll see us do more of that work.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. We have a question also from John Hodulik of UBS. This one I'll point to Greg, but Spencer, you can feel free to join in as well. The question is, how should we think about pricing changes in the rest of the world now that you are through the majority of the password sharing implementation, and in light of the recent price adjustments in the US, UK, and France?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. As we had talked about previously, we largely put price increases on hold while we were rolling out the paid sharing work because we saw that as a form of substitute price increase. Now that we're through that, we're able to resume our sort of standard approach towards price increases. You've seen us do that in the US, UK, and France. Those changes went well, better than we forecasted. We'll continue to monitor other countries and try and assess when we've delivered enough additional entertainment value. We look at engagement, retention, and acquisition as the signals there so that we can go back to members and ask them to pay a bit more to keep that positive flywheel going, and we can invest in more great films, series, and games for those members. The summary statement might be back to business as usual.\nSpencer, I don't know if you wanted to add anything there.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI think you nailed it. You're on a roll, so it's good.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I'll move us along now to a couple of questions on competition and the competitive landscape. The first question comes from Maria Rips of Canaccord Genuity. With ads coming to Prime Video at the end of this month, and given Amazon is making it the default option for its Prime members, could you talk about how you are positioning Netflix relative to the competition when you're speaking with advertisers? Could you also comment on if Netflix considered making the ad tier the default option similar to Amazon? What were some of the puts and takes about that decision? I'll turn that one over to you, Greg.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we did consider making it the default option, but given our long history of not having ads, we thought it was better for our members rather than force them into a change and give them ads. Better to attract them to the ads plan for the ones that wanted it based on the benefits: more streams, higher resolution, downloads, and, of course, the lower price to be able to access all these incredible stories. I mentioned that the growth numbers we were seeing previously and the rate of growth were on, so I think that approach is generally working well for our members, and we haven't seen any big backlash as a result, which is positive as well. In terms of competitive positioning, probably the most important thing to start with is the market's big, right?\nWe talked about over $25 billion US dollars in CTV ad spend alone. There's room for multiple players, clearly. When we think about how we compete for some of that ad spend, I really think we need to play to our strengths. We've got an incredibly engaged audience, the most engaged audience who are watching the most culture-defining films, series, and live events. That is an important place for brands to be, and it's something that differentiates us from our competitors. That's the space that we're going to play in.\n\nOperator\n\nSuper. Another question on competition. This one probably best for Ted and Spencer to take. It comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. How does the current competitive landscape for content impact the trajectory of Netflix's own content spending in 2024 and beyond? Is it possible that the company could widen its competitive moat on the same or lower absolute amount of content spend?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think it's always been a competitive place for the top programming. I think that'll continue. That's really what I think what you're talking about, whether when the top titles come to market, when the big packages come and everyone's duking it out for them, it's going to remain to be pretty competitive. I think that we're reinvesting at a very healthy rate. We see that in the engagement, the retention, and the subscriber growth. I don't think this would be the time to try to test that. Spencer, I don't know if you think differently, but.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would just say just to reinforce that, I mean, we've seen the benefits over time of continuous improvement, great execution, and focus, and kind of gradually building our business and doing it really well and thrilling our members. You see it like we are increasing our content spend and coming out of the strikes in 2023. We're trying to get back up to as much as $17 billion US dollars of cash content spend this year. As we've also said over the last few years, as we kind of re-accelerate our revenue growth, which we're seeing in the business, we hope to sustain that healthy revenue growth, grow profit and profit margins over time, and then reinvest a good portion of that back into business, which means increasing our content spend.\nWe do plan to do that, but we want to do it in a smart, judicious, responsible way. Obviously, today's even announcement with WWE is a case in point. We believe we have room to do that while still staying very disciplined in terms of our overall content spend, and our business performance.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I think the perception of overserving thrilling content to our members has served us pretty well, so.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. And we've got lots of room to grow, obviously. And so we just want to do it in a disciplined way. No question.\n\nOperator\n\nYep. Another question from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. A bigger picture question. Given the scale of audience that has been built by Netflix, how do you think about the potential for new areas to widen your exposure to verticals or formats of media consumption? I think maybe Eric is referring to short-form content or UGC, things like that. Ted?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI would kind of call back to something that Greg alluded to earlier. In the areas of business that are in our core, movies, television, and now games, that business, we're capturing about 5% of consumer spending. In our most mature markets, we're getting about 10% of TV time. So in our very core business, we still have an enormous room to grow. So when I look at that, it doesn't make me think about searching for more inorganic growth in different kinds of programming. There's so much room to grow in this bit of programming that we're kind of hopefully getting better and better at for our members every day. So there's a lot of adjacent businesses that are not necessarily competitive and are certainly complementary in some ways.\nSome of those platforms that you're talking about, maybe in the user-generated space, have turned out to be great marketing tools for our professional content. I think we're rightfully focused, I think, on the core of professional storytelling.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I'm going to move us over to a few questions around capital allocation. The first is from Brian Pitz of BMO Capital Markets. Basically, the question for Spencer is, can you help us frame your M&A views over the next 12 months? Is there the possibility for mobile gaming, acqui-hire, or what other sorts of M&A activity would Netflix be interested in?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, thanks, Brian. We're not going to speculate on kind of potential M&A activity, but as you know, our historical bias is to build and not buy. We try to be very responsible in terms of our capital allocation philosophy. We hold a modest amount of debt. We're currently holding $10 to 15 billion US dollars in gross debt. We fully fund our business and new initiatives. You see that in terms of our investment into ads, into live, into games, while still growing the business. We'll look at selective accelerators to that organic growth. We have done that. We're not interested in some of the big linear assets that may or may not be available. We also noted that in the letter. I think that's how you should kind of think about what's out there to go after.\n\nOperator\n\nStaying with you, Spencer, another question on capital allocation. This one coming from Alan Gould of Loop Capital. We know your general rule of thumb is to have cash equal to two months of revenue. How big of a factor is the current stock price in your buyback activity? Some of your debt begins maturing over the next few years. What do you believe is the optimal leverage ratio to maximize shareholder value?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, sure. I'm glad you asked because I missed the last piece of our capital allocation philosophy, which is to hold about two months of revenue in the form of cash on the balance sheet, and then to return the excess cash to shareholders over time. We've done that in the form of buyback. With a little over $7 billion US dollars of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year, and with, as you say, our expectation for strong cash flow build in the year, roughly $6 billion US dollars is what we're projecting at current FX rates for 2024, you can expect that we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders through the buyback. We don't try to time the kind of stock price.\nWe really are kind of more in a, I'd call it more of a price averaging sort of approach in that we buy back over time as we have excess cash. In terms of optimal leverage ratio, look, we are fortunate to have continued to strengthen our balance sheet. We had a recent upgrade from Moody's in Q4. We continue to grow into that investment-grade balance sheet, but we were pretty intentionally under-leveraged, frankly. We think the optimal, without getting overly specific, we think essentially, as I said, our capital allocation strategy has served us well, and that philosophy has served us well over the past handful of years. We think that flexibility in the balance sheet also serves us well to adapt to a quite dynamic industry.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. I think we'll wrap up with one final question. It's actually one question we've gotten from several different analysts. In the spirit of WWE, probably a good one for Ted and Greg to tag team on. The question is, what are your key 2024 priorities? Maybe Greg, first to you.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. I think you've heard us express this multiple times this call, but we see so much potential and so much opportunity ahead of us in our core business. We got hundreds of millions of qualified households out there that have still yet to sign up for Netflix. I can't believe it, but they're there, and we've got to win them over. There's many hours, like billions of hours of TV time that we are not currently winning. Growing along those two dimensions, more households, and more moments of truth, we call them, more entertainment value delivered, is the key priority for us. We want to improve our entertainment offering to do that. That means delivering more stories that our members love, films, series, games, now live events. That's the key to that success.\nWe're focusing on improving how we translate all that additional entertainment value into revenue and improved operating margin. That means growing our ads business, growing general plans, and pricing optimization. That's the major area of work there. That's what we're going to be focused on for 2024, and we're super excited to do it. With that, I'll tag team to my partner, co-CEO.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe'll do that instead of a sleeper hold. I think everything you said is 100%, Greg, and I think it all is built on the foundation of movies, TV series, and games that people love, can't live without, talk about, can't wait to get back to, post about, that drives the conversation, that drives this love for programming and entertainment. We're going to start that with next week, Griselda, a brand new show from the makers of Narcos starring Sofia Vergara. That's insane. It's so good. Following the success of One Piece, we've got a brand new Avatar: The Last Airbender coming for fans. We've got the Three-Body Problem based on one of the top-selling science fiction books of all time from the creators of Game of Thrones. We have a new show from the UK from Guy Ritchie called The Gentleman. That's insanely fun.\nWe're back with returning seasons of Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Diplomat, and Squid Game. On top of that, great movies like the second part of Rebel Moon coming up, Damsel with Millie Bobby Brown, Jennifer Lopez's new film Atlas, Hit Man, which drove everybody crazy at Sundance last night, and Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, and so much more. It's so fun, and this is a never-ending mission to continue to improve this for our members and make sure that we're bringing them all the joy that we can. I want to thank all the teams at Netflix who have made that possible in 2023 and will in 2024. I'm very excited, and I'll throw it back to you, Spencer.\n\nOperator\n\nAwesome. Thank you so much, Ted. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Spencer, for answering the questions from analysts. I also want to thank our audience for tuning into our first-ever live-streamed video format. We look forward to your feedback. In the spirit of continuous improvement at Netflix on everything, we look forward to getting better at this over time. Thank you all again, and we'll see you next quarter.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks, everybody.",

Joining me today are CO-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, and CFO Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. Jessica, let me turn it over to you now for your first question.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Let's start with you, Ted. Now that the Writers Guild strike is over, what are the implications for your business?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks, Jessica. Let me first say, we want nothing more than to resolve this and get everyone back to work. That's true for Netflix. That's true for every member of the ANPTP. It's why our member CEOs have prioritized these negotiations above everything else we're doing. We spent hours and hours with SAG-AFTRA over the last few weeks, and we were actually very optimistic that we were making progress.\nAt the very end of our last session together, the Guild presented this new demand that, kind of on top of everything, for a per-subscriber levy unrelated to viewing or success. This really broke our momentum, unfortunately. You should know we are incredibly and totally committed to ending this strike. The industry, our communities, and the economy are all hurting.\nWe need to get a deal done that respects all sides as soon as we possibly can. In terms of the impact, these are the times that I'm glad we have such a rich, deep, and broad programming selection. Programming costs themselves rise nearly every year, primarily driven by competition, competition for talent, competition for shows and films. You can see we've managed successfully through that year-on-year-on-year.\nThe same is true during COVID when we were able to manage the slate through prolonged and pretty unpredictable production interruptions. I really think we're not really that focused right now on how this impacts much, except for our biggest opportunity, which is to continue improving the quality of the site. We're focused on that day-in, day-out, year-in, year-out.\nI'm incredibly pleased with Bella and the team and the progress that they're making. If you'll indulge me for just a second, I would draw your attention to the Q4 slate as an example of that, headlined by the return of The Crown for its final season. This is one of the most ambitious television shows in the history of television. We have a new season of Big Mouth, a new season of Elite, the launch of Berlin, which is a spinoff from our La Casa de Papel, our Money Heist franchise, and new limited series like All the Light You Cannot See from Sean Levy. That's incredible. And Bodies from the UK. That's just on the TV side. On the film side, one of our strongest quarters ever.\nWe have this enormous sci-fi spectacular from Zack Snyder, Rebel Moon, a new film from David Fincher, The Killer, and these films that just lit up the fall film festivals recently, like May December from Todd Haynes and Bradley Cooper's Maestro, the doc feature, American Symphony. That's all coming in Q4.\nFor family viewing, too, we've got a new animated feature from Adam Sandler called Leo that's hysterical, Chicken Run 2, which is the sequel to the most successful stop-motion animation film ever, and a new series from the Cocomelon world called Cocomelon Lane, Family Switch from director McG, with Jennifer Garner and Ed Helms. It's an incredible slate, something new and exciting for all tastes, all moods, all ages. We're just super proud of the team that they've been able to manage through this and still deliver so much joy for our members.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOne more on strike-related, just the aftermath. You discussed at a recent conference giving talent more transparency. Could you talk about what that looks like? What are the new metrics talent will be paid on, and is it even standardized across the industry?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, what I talked about there was heading towards a world where streaming data will be much more readily available. Remember, streaming itself is not that exotic anymore. We've been doing it for 15 years. In the beginning, we thought there was a hard kind of apples and oranges comparison to ratings and streaming.\nI think we've gotten to a place where it's mostly about engagement, and that does capture the value of watching, and that things will become much more transparent the way TV has always had ratings, music has always had Billboard, and the theatricals always had Box Office. It'll be much more common for the data to be fully transparent. What I didn't mention, though, is that part of our reason for not publishing early was part of our promise with creators.\nAt the time we started creating original programming, our creators felt like they were pretty trapped in this kind of overnight ratings world and weekend box office world defining their success and failures. As we all know, a show might have enormous success down the road, and it was not captured in that opening Box Office. Part of this was the relationship with talent, not just the business aspects of it.\nI do think that over time, people are much more interested in this. We are on the continuum today of how much data do we publish. I think we have been leading the charge, starting everyone down the path of a top 10, publishing our top 10 list, our annual wrap-up list, and everything that gives a lot of transparency to the viewing. I just expect it will be more and more transparent.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Let's move on to paid sharing. Have you identified most of the borRors? Can you provide any help in how much more is left to go in the challenge in completing the crackdown?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. I'll take that one. I'll start by saying we're just incredibly pleased with how it's been going. You can see the progress from our membership growth in Q2. Now in Q3, you can see it embedded in the revenue outlook for Q4. I think paid sharing represents the kind of difficult challenge where we needed to balance both important, relevant consumer considerations with the importance of ensuring that our business got reasonably paid when we deliver entertainment.\nIt's an example where we leverage core executional capabilities that we've been building for over a decade, sort of how you develop good product experiences, how you solve hard problems through them, how you have an iterative model where you listen to consumers to tell us what's working and what's not. We've been excited about that.\nBecause it's such a challenging problem, we're shifting essentially consumers' expectations and what they expect from us. We've always thought that making this change should be done in a steady, considered way. Our plan has been to stage out this rollout. We've been delivering our product experience to different borRor cohorts according to that plan. As a result, I think as you're alluding to, there are a number of borRor cohorts which, as of today, have not received part of that experience.\nJust to explain that a bit, I mean, part of the motivation to stage it out is based on technical considerations. This is our ability to build features and improve model accuracy over time in a way that allows us to ensure that we're accurately developing and applying our interventions in as effective and as positive a way for consumers as possible.\nPart of that has been just to stage things out based on borRor behavior. We want to show up with the right product experience at the right moment that's more likely to convert a borRor over rather than have them spin off. We want to think about that for maximizing long-term revenue. We're going to continue the rollout for the next couple of quarters. I think folks are trying to figure out how much juice is left there.\nI would say we anticipate that we will have incremental acquisition, incremental adds for the next several quarters. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters. I think also worth noting that that was on top of also very healthy organic, meaning not driven by paid sharing growth. We anticipate seeing that for the next several quarters to come.\nJust stepping back, there's a set of borRors that we're not going to convert. We haven't converted yet. We're not going to convert over the next couple of quarters. That really represents how we think about paid sharing going forward, which is it's now become part of just our standard way of operating.\nWe have many hundreds of millions of qualified households out there. They're smart TV households that we want to win over over the next several years. Those borRors we're not going to convert in the next couple of quarters represent that same group. We got to go after them the same way we're going after people who have never signed up for Netflix, which is having an incredible content offering, incredible value, and get them so excited that they just have to sign up.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nRight. Moving on to the recent advertising restructuring, can you talk about why you made the management change, and what you would like to accomplish?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. First, I'd say Jeremy has done a great job getting us essentially from zero to where we are today. She’s laid the foundation for the ads business, hired and built a burgeoning team of leaders who, in turn, now are hiring the teams and people who are going to take the business forward. It's an important time, and I think a great time for Amy to come in and extend that great work, build on that foundation, and drive our ads business to the next level. Why am I so specifically excited about Amy in the role? First of all, she's a high Netflix tenure employee. She's been with the company for over seven years.\nShe's demonstrated really positive impact and great results in several different roles, but most recently as part of the studio and leading a big global team that is scaling very, very, very quickly, which sounds familiar when you think about where we want to take our ads business.\nSecond, she's got broad entertainment experience ranging from Content Licensing and Distribution. She's got Business Development, Finance, Strategy at Netflix and in prior roles. I think when you think about that assemblage of skills, and you think about the existing ads leadership team that we have that has got a rich, rich history in ads in general, and connected TV especially, you think about somebody like Peter Naylor who started selling connected TV at Hulu, that's a strong team to take our ads business to the next level.\nI want to maybe just restate what we think that the promise and the opportunity and sort of where we're at on ads business is. First of all, just starting off with this is a $180 billion opportunity when you think about linear TV, you think about connected TV, not including YouTube, not including China and Russia. We think we're in a great position to win some of those dollars. We've got great content the brands want to be next to. We're a safe place for brands to exist. We've got great engagement from our members. That's a really strong foundation to work with. We've got a lot of work, and we know we have a lot of work to fulfill that potential. Among that work, we've said it many times.\nI'll say it probably many times going forward, but scale is the number one priority. We're making good progress there. This quarter, we grew our ad plan membership 70% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. That's on top of the last quarter where we grew at 100% quarter-to-quarter. We now have 30% of our new sign-ups choosing our ads plan in our ads countries.\nWe've done it by making the ads offering more competitive. We've gotten to over 95% content parity with our non-ads plans. We've improved features like number of streams, the video resolution. We're going to keep doing that. We're adding downloads now. We'll keep that good trajectory going and keep focusing on it. Second big priority for us is delivering features and products that advertisers want. We've heard again and again, I've heard it this week, ad week from advertisers.\nTop of that list is measurement. We've launched our measurement partnership withNielsen in the United States this month, in October. We're excited about that. We've got a long list of other partners across other countries that we've got to deliver that same capability in. We're excited about getting that out. We're also excited about new products. We've rolled out our top 10 media buy.\nWe're going to roll out our binge ad product later this year. We're launching more ways to buy programmatically through Microsoft, which gives more buyers more ways to access our inventory. We've got a lot of work to do here on all those fronts. We've always said this is a multi-year build, a multi-year progress. We've got a lot that we've got going on, and we're excited about the future to come.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nNow that you've phased out Basic for new subs, and you're getting extra members or paid more per sub from password sharing crackdown, and you've introduced advertising in 12 countries, can you talk about the outlook for ARM in 2024 and beyond?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYou guys want me to take that one?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nGo ahead, Spence.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nAll right. You wound it up for me. Thanks, Jessica. I would say just generally when we think about 2024 and beyond, think about it as our revenue growth profile in general. We talked about this recently. We expect a more balanced mix of membership and ARM growth in 2024 and beyond 2024.\nJust looking at 2024 specifically, as Ted talked about, we expect to have a great slate to drive the business forward. We expect to continue to do things like add extra members, grow our advertising revenue, as Greg discussed. In addition, have some pricing adjustments. You saw that in our letter. All those things will drive ARM. 2023 was a pretty unusual year where essentially all of our growth came from member growth.\nGoing forward more broadly, not just 2024 and beyond, we'll grow our business by continuing to kind of improve our service, increasing engagement, increasingly satisfying current and future members. Now that, as Greg discussed, we've got an account sharing solution, we have a more clear path to more deeply penetrate that big addressable market of a half a billion connected TV households and growing.\nWith our continued plan evolution, pricing sophistication, and all that hard work around our ads business, we'll keep getting better at monetizing that big and growing reach and engagement. We believe we've got a long runway for growth in both kind of more membership and higher ARM over time in a more balanced way than what you saw this year, which was, again, a pretty unusual year.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYou touched on, Greg touched on scale and advertising. How do you get to scale? Is it all through pricing, like pricing changes? What would you consider scale?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I think it's important to note that scale isn't, it's not a binary condition, right? It's not like you suddenly add one more member and you become a must-buy situation. We become increasingly competitive with increasing reach. It's also, I think, worth noting that it's different in different countries. It's largely based on what's the competitive channels and what's that competitive dynamic.\nHaving said that, though, we carry several relevancy targets on a per-country basis. Think about this as essentially a percentage of market penetration that helps us focus and drive the rate of growth that we desire. We've got more work to do to get those. I mean, we're not satisfied with the scale that we're at in any country that we're in. We want to be bigger. We know we can be bigger.\nI think there's a variety of techniques that we can employ to do that: pricing, and thinking about how do we factor in what's optimal pricing for ads, no ads. That's part of what we're doing, and thinking about plan evolution. Part of it is what I mentioned before, which is feature set, right? These are the things that consumers want to sign up for. Part of it too is actually just educating consumers.\nI think what we are seeing is in some of our countries, consumers think about an ads experience mostly anchored in linear, and what their expectation around ad load, frequency rates are. To some degree, actually, some of our streaming competitors haven't done maybe as great a job in building an ads experience, which informs that expectation as well.\nPart of it is just educating consumers about what the actual Netflix ads experience is so that they can think about what's the right choice for them. Do they want a lower price with ads and what we think is a great ads experience for consumers, really? Or do they want to pay more and skip ads? It's all those things coming together that ultimately drive us to the several multiples of scale that we're at today that we'll be satisfied with.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOne last one maybe on advertising before we move on to margins. You mentioned a lot of the innovative offerings that you plan on, and some of it's sponsored. It's very unique, it's different. When do we get to a point, or when will you have a point where it's targeted, addressable, so it's really relevant for consumers, and so they would want to see the ads.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYes, we're working with Microsoft right now on targeting. You'll see that roll out in the near future. That, I think, is the first step of how we think about increasing targeting relevance through both a combination of product sets. What are the types of ad products that brands can buy that yield increasing relevance, as well as improving our sort of sophistication on what we might call targeting from a digital perspective, which is basically matching consumers who are most interested in that particular brand's message.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Spence, I guess this was for you on margins, but can you elaborate on areas like ad tech, content spend? Well, you did talk about content spend in your latter, but any other meaningful investment areas, something that maybe we're not thinking about?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. Let me step back a bit with some quick context. First, Jessica, we set margin targets. They're our best judgment of how kind of best to grow the long-term value of Netflix. We're trying to balance investment for future growth with near-term profits.\nFor instance, after investing heavily to launch Global in 2016, Global Netflix, we wanted to take a disciplined approach to building profitability as we grew revenue because we felt, one, it was a good way to build that profit muscle across the company, and two, we understood that investors, they've been pretty patient with us. We wanted to demonstrate the scalability and the health of the business model. That took us from, it was like 4% operating income margin business in 2016 to our current roughly 20% margin.\nWe think a pretty good indicator that at scale, streaming can be a quite good business. Now, stepping back, there's no change in our financial objectives, and also no change in our long-term margin expectations, including the fact that we see a, we don't think we're anywhere near a margin ceiling. We've got a long runway of margin growth. Again, no change in our objectives, no change in our long-term margin expectations. At our current profitability and scale, we think it's prudent to balance that historical pace of margin improvement with growth investments. You asked about growth investments. We think we've got a lot of places where we can continue to invest.\nPlenty of room to invest further in our existing content categories where a small share of viewing in every country in which we operate, plus building out those ads capabilities that Greg talked about, our live offering, and new content categories like games. There's plenty to do. All that said, we'll continue to drive healthy margin expansion.\nWe expect roughly 22% to 23 operating margin in 2024, assuming no material swings in FX. That's up from our current expectation of 20% this year, which is at the high end of the range that we targeted in the beginning of the year. Again, Jessica, just like we did in the past, going forward, we'll take a disciplined approach to balancing margin improvement with investing into our growth.\nWe actually put a chart at the end of the letter that shows how we've managed that balance historically, growing content investment, profit margins, and cash flow. You should expect that we'll carry that same discipline going forward as we invest and grow into that big opportunity ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHow does licensing content from third parties play into your overall content strategy? It seems like you've had incredible success with third-party content in the, I mean, you always have, but in the last year, things like Suits or Band of Brothers, and you mentioned it in the letter. If you could just talk about the third-party licensing.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Licensing third-party content has always been part of our strategy. Something we've been really great at being able to do is match that audience. I think Suits is a great example of the impact of the Netflix effect that we could have. Because of our distribution footprint and our recommendation system, we were able to take Suits, which had played on cable and had played on other streaming services, and pop it right into the center of the culture in a huge way, not just in the US, but all over the world.\nAccording to the Nielsen charts, Suits was the number one watched streaming series for 13 straight weeks. That is a record for Nielsen. This continues to be important for us to add a lot of breadth of storytelling to our consumers, who have a wide range of taste.\nWe can't make everything, but we can help you find just about anything. That's really the strength. I do think that looking, you mentioned Band of Brothers, but in that HBO deal, we had Insecure, we had Ballers that came out, and they were very successful on Netflix. They popped into the top 10 on their originating network for the first time. That was on their streaming service, which is really powerful. I think we have more to come with Six Feet Under and True Blood coming.\nNot just on the TV side, but we're also proud to be able to bring movies like Super Mario Brothers and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse from our other suppliers. In one way or another, we're in business with nearly every supplier, including our direct competitors.\nI think that we bring a ton of value to them. I think when you think about what happens when that show runs in and becomes a huge success on Netflix, it has lasting value. I mean, look at the value we created that still continues today for shows like Friends, The Office, Full House, Gilmore Girls, and all these other shows that really found an audience on Netflix even after they have more or less played out through traditional models.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nSpence, one more on margins for you. You said in September that long-term margins will be, I think the way you said it was, similar to other networks, which historically have been in the 40% to 50 range. Could you help us think through the ramp in margins over time?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nJessica, I'll probably disappoint you as I have in the past on this. We're not going to put a long-term number out there. As I said, we don't see any near-term ceiling to our long-term margin potential. We've talked in the past about how we're going to feel our way through to those kind of long-term steady-state margins, but we think we have a lot of things working in our favor.\nWe have a very scalable business model. You see that play out over the last handful of years, and continue to do so as we produce content all over the world for big local impact, but also with the ability for those stories to, through great subs, dubs, discovery, to reach more and more people, and to be enjoyed around the world. It's a very scalable content model.\nIt's a global network at scale that in many ways has not been seen with legacy entertainment networks. We think we've got a long way to go. As I just talked about, we want to balance those increasing profits in the near term with investing into that long-term opportunity. Still a lot of runway. That's a set of benchmarks you can look at. There's others as well. Suffice to say, we think we've got a long and healthy runway in terms of growing margins.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nOne thing I would add to that, Jessica, also totally agree with what Spence said, which is, again, a lot of opportunity to grow margins, but profit dollars also matter too, right? As we expand into big new addressable markets like advertising that Greg alluded to or gaming also, right? Those open up big new sort of areas for us to expand into. We intend to grow margins too, but we also want a lot of profit dollars as well. We're not narrowly optimizing just for percentage margin.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nRight. Of course. You announced some price changes today in Premium and Basic in several countries, and more to come. Can you provide a current view of price increase or timeframe for the standards here?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. As you know, our focus on plan evolution over the last 18 months has largely been about paid sharing. Now that we've rolled that out, we broadly see the benefits, as outlined in the letter. That's become a normal part of our business, which then allows us to return to our core approach to pricing. That approach, that philosophy has not changed. We look to wisely invest the money that our members pay us, deliver back to them more amazing stories, more entertainment value, and then when we think we're doing that, we'll occasionally ask them to pay a bit more to keep that virtuous circle spinning. Hence the changes that you noted and that we've announced in the letter.\nI think it's also worth noting that we seek to have a wide, and even wider over time, range of price points with a corresponding set of features, of course, that allows entertainment fans from around the world that have different needs to be able to access the great storytelling that our creative partners are doing at a price point that works for them, at a feature set that works for them. Part of that widespread is the low entry price point. That's why we're keeping that low entry price point static as it is. We think that this $6.99 in the US, GBP 4.99 in the UK, EUR 5.99 in France, I think that's just an incredible entertainment value.\nIf you think about the breadth and the variety of storytelling that we're offering, whether that's compared to our streaming competitors, compared to traditional pay TV, certainly, even the price of a movie ticket, we think that's just an amazing offer. Our goal and plan is to continue to be a great entertainment value. Beyond that, we're not going to comment on other price changes or other changes on tiers. We'll sort of find our way based on that philosophy and see when the right time to ask customers to pay a little bit more would be.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOne more question on the pricing, though. Given the price increase for just Premium and Basic, not Standard, or advertising tier, do you expect any movement between the tiers as a result of these price increases?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think pricing always results in a bit of movement between the tiers. More of that movement is how people are signing up. We see that as more what it influences. It will also influence plan changes as well. Generally, plan changes tend to be, or plans tend to be, relatively sticky. I would imagine that that momentum will continue.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYour letter today says that you stated that you will spend $17 billion in 2024 on content spend, up from $13 billion in 2023. Obviously, that was somewhat strike impacted. How can you help us think through how content spend will grow beyond 2024? What is normalized growth?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, you see that what we've done is we've wanted to grow the content spend just about a half a step ahead of revenue to create the value proposition for our members. The more we put into it, and a lot of it is tied to the ability to create hits out of that pool. I would say one thing, if I could, if you don't, this past quarter, we had this really remarkable story about something that we could do with the Spence talked a little bit about the kind of scale of the content spend, but this show, One Piece.\nOne Piece is something that is a very unique property. It was created 26 years ago by Akira Oda. It is over 1,000 episodes of the animated series based on the Japanese manga. It's nearly sacred IP. We were able to, with our Japanese creative teams and our American teams getting together, working with our partners at Tomorrow Studios and the showrunner, Steven Maeda, to adapt this into a show that the world fell in love with.\nWhen I say that is we've got this show is number one in 84 countries around the world, which is something that Stranger Things didn't do, that Wednesday didn't do. It's so rare for an English show to be that popular in Japan, Korea, Brazil, and in the US at the same time. The other fun part of it is Inaki Godoy, who stars in the show, it was one of the most difficult casting challenges in the history of our original programming was who's going to play Monkey D. Luffy. He was right under our nose, right in our talent family.\nWe discovered him a couple of years ago and had him in this great show in our Mexican series called Who Killed Sara. We were able to cast him in this, and now he's a global superstar. This is that kind of thing you could do well, a thing that's hard to copy and gives us kind of competitive running room from our competitors being able to do that more and more. When I say that, I don't mean making things more global.\nI think making things that really resonate for the core audience. Usually, local audiences want very local content. In this case, the local audience is the fan of One Piece, which was very discriminating. We had to please them first, just like our original shows in Spain have to really please the Spanish customer first. We can do this. We spend the money well, we have impact with the spend, and we grow it as we grow revenue. [crosstalk]\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nOh, sorry. Go ahead, Jessica. I was just going to build a bit of a kind of a little bit on Ted's point on the kind of trajectory of content spend. We talked about this a little bit in the past. First, in the letter, we talk about the fact for 2024, we hope to get cash content spend back up to at or near that $17 billion level. The biggest swing factor is going to be when the SAG-AFTRA strike resolves.\nThat will get us to a cash-to-P&L ratio kind of closer to 1x to 1.1x. We are not putting a specific number out there for free cash flow in 2024. What that gets us to when you think about the combination of our revenue growth outlook, our margin guidance, and target cash content spend, we'll deliver substantial free cash flow in 2024.\nGoing beyond that, we do expect to tick up our content investment over time as we also prove that sustained healthy revenue growth. Assuming we talked about, I think in the last call, assuming no big expansions, we'd expect our cash-to-P&L ratio of content spend, cash to content, amort, and the P&L to be roughly 1.1x. That'xs kind of one way folks are thinking about how to model our growth in content spend. As we grow our revenue, as we improve our profitability, we should see both increasing content spend, but also free cash flow growing nicely over time.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nJust one, just a follow-up for Ted, though. There's so much going on in content right now. Could you maybe talk about investment priorities? How do you think about whether it's local language, film, TV? You've made a lot of deals with some third-party film companies, television companies. Could you give us some color on how you think about content spend?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we always have a lot of plate spinning because our members have got such different tastes and different desires. We're trying to please them all. Like I say, trying to find that person who really fell in love with us for prestige TV and then discovered Love Is Blind. That's a pretty common household, to be honest with you. We've got to be able to be good at so many different things.\nOur partnerships, I'm assuming you're talking about Skydance in this case, really help us find and keep up that scale as we grow. We're really thrilled with our success in animated features. It's a very long cycle of development and production. Sometimes it could take a decade to deliver a really great animated feature film. As you know, we move pretty fast, and we've been moving pretty fast.\nNo single company has ever really successfully launched more than two animated features in a single year. That deal helps us to complement the work that we're doing, like you saw this year with Leo and Chicken Run coming out and Nimona that already came out. We've got a very, there's a ton of appetite. If you look at the top 10 animated features since Nielsen's been tracking movie watching, seven of them are animated features. There's a lot of appetite for animated features, and we're committed to that part of the business. We do that through a combination of licensing, partnerships, original production, and original creation, and not just in the US, but all over the world.\nWe have to find that right balance of finding the right product-market fit, which helps us grow those territories and, most importantly, helps create a value proposition for consumers. They could say, hey, what I pay for Netflix, I can pay a little bit more because I get so much value there, and I'm spending so much of my time there.\nIf you think about the last 37 to the last 38 weeks of this year, Netflix has had the number one streaming series in all of streaming. For 31 of those 38 weeks, we've had the number one movie too. In any given week, we might have had the number one, two, and three. We really, we've got a lot going on, and we've got to stay focused on continuing to improve the value proposition to consumers, which drives the numbers that we've been talking about on this call.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nSpence, you announced a very significant increase in your buyback today. Should we think of the $2.5 billion buyback in the third quarter as sort of a run rate moving forward?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI wouldn't kind of read through to that, Jessica. We had kind of slowed down as the business slowed down, and we wanted to, we talked about the fact that we had less than typical forward visibility into our forecast over the past year or so as we were looking to re-accelerate the business and also roll out paid sharing. Now much of that is behind us, as we've said, and we've got a better view going forward.\nWe ramped up our repurchase because we had built up some cash on the balance sheet as well. Our target minimum cash is roughly two months of revenue, so ±$6 billion of cash that we look to hold on our balance sheet. We had gotten ahead of that, are still a little ahead of that.\nThat's really what we're managing to is to, one, primarily drive the business forward, grow the business, expand our cash flow, and then if excess cash builds on the balance sheet, to return it to shareholders. We put a pretty specific target out there of roughly two months of revenue in the form of cash on the balance sheet, and that's the way I think you should think about what our pacing will be over time.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMoving on to gaming, it feels like almost like the way you described advertising, like a walk, crawl, run approach. What is the near and mid-term strategy in gaming?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, let's start with the big prize. I think that's the better way to look at it, which is games is a huge entertainment opportunity. We're talking about $140 billion worth of consumer spend on games outside of China and outside of Russia. From a strategic perspective, we believe that we can build games into a strong content category, leveraging our current core film and series by connecting members, especially members that are fans of specific IPs, with games that they will love.\nI think it's worth noting that if we can make those connections, and as we make those connections, as we're seeing, we're essentially sidestepping the biggest issue that the mobile games market has today, which is how do you cost-effectively acquire new players. That's the real proposition.\nWe think if we deliver that, we give members great games entertainment experiences that they love at sufficient scale, then we leverage back into the core business. We increase engagement, we increase retention, we increase value delivered. Those all drive our core business metrics. I think it's actually just a very natural extension of what you were just talking with Ted about.\nIf you think about the range of content that we're offering, the variety of content and entertainment that we're offering, games just adds one extra layer to that variety and that depth. We're also seeing, I would say, back to moving it more to your short-term and mid-term, we're also seeing performance metrics that support that those fundamental strategic hypotheses are sound. Games engagement right now on our service drives core business metrics in a way which is incremental to movies and series.\nThe main challenge ahead of us to get to your mid-term is that our current scale and, frankly, our current investment level are both very, very, very small relative to our overall content spend and engagement. Now our job is to incrementally scale to the place where games have a material impact on the business. We've got ambitious plans there. We want to really grow our engagement by many multiples of where it is today over the next handful of years, and we can see how to get there.\nLooking a layer deeper at the title level, we see some titles are really working for our members, and they're working for our business. If we can do more of those, we know we can scale into that proposition. We've got to do that through better title selection based on everything that we're learning.\nWe've got to do it on better product features to maximize connection with the audience for any given title. We have to do it by gradually improving consumer awareness, which we've seen as when we launched other content categories. You can think about unscripted, or you can think about film. That broadly lifts overall engagement metrics as consumers learn that we're a place to go to to find games.\nI'm excited about what we got going on in Q4. We're going to launch some big, high-profile titles that sort of keeps that drumbeat going. We got Dead Cells, we got Football Manager 2024, we've got Money Heist. Think about connections with RIP. That's coming in Q4 as well. That's La Casa de Papel for folks who have saw it in that language. We also have Virgin River coming in Q1.\nAs you pointed out, this trajectory is not dissimilar from what we've seen before. When we've launched a new region, think about Latin America, or we launched a country like Japan where traditional Western media companies have struggled, or we launched new genres like unscripted. We've got to crawl, walk, run, and we build it. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity to build a long-term center of value of entertainment, more entertainment value for our members.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nIt's a great experience for the super fan to get themselves in the universe in between seasons of a show. It's really exciting.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nJessica, we have time for about two last questions, please.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay, great. I'll get to one. The first of the two, sports, you're creating the Netflix Cup tournament to be aired next month. Is this a change in your sports strategy at all, or how should we think about that?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I knew this was coming, Jessica. We are in the sports business, but we're in the part of the sports business that we bring the most value to, which is the drama of sport. Look at the success we've had with Drive to Survive. Look at the success we've had with Tour de France, Quarterback, Full Swing, Untold, and most recently with Beckham. David Beckham is one of the biggest stars in the world, and his documentary on Netflix brought him almost half a million new social media followers in a week. We are having a big impact on sports through the thing that we're most great at, which is the drama of sport.\nThe Netflix Cup is a live event that actually brings together the cast of Drive to Survive and Full Swing, and puts them into a live golf tournament that we are going to stream live on Netflix on 14 November 2023. I think about it as a great way of extending those great drama of sport brands that we've created, but no core change in our live sports strategy or licensing live sports. We are investing heavily in increasing our live capabilities so that as the demand grows for that, and we find different ways that the liveness can be part of the creative storytelling, we want to be able to do that at big scale.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThere was some news also today, I guess, on comedy. My last question to stay with what Spence asked, you talked a little bit more recently about your ancillary businesses, including the Netflix House. Can you talk about what that looks like over time? Will it be a big investment area, but more importantly, will it be a contributor?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCO-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, look at this initiative that's inside of our Consumer Products and Experiences group. Today, they run these successful businesses where they travel these live experiences all over the world, and fans engage in them in ways that would shock you. People love these things so much. They show up. Dozens of people have proposed marriage at the Bridgerton Ball. It's really important, a way to kind of deepen fandom, a way to express fandom. You kind of see it on a large scale with theme parks. These build-outs are not going to be like a theme park, both in that they won't have that gigantic CapEx, and we expect that fans will go multiple times a year, not just once every couple of years. It's a way to take a business that's really good at growing our brands and strengthening our brands.\nToday, it has to have a big startup and shutdown cost as they travel around and put them under one umbrella where we can add a little technology and make it a really phenomenal experience from being as part of the Money Heist escape room, the Stranger Things experience, or the Squid Game challenge, all those different things that people can do live together and have a lot of fun. They could also go to the Netflix Bites and have a food experience with all the Netflix food brands. It really kind of strengthens the brands and strengthens the excitement around the things that people are watching on Netflix and falling in love with, and gives them a place to go and express it.\nIt's not a material investment relative to the big business that we're all in, but it's a great way of building it like our consumer products business.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. Well, Jessica, thank you very much for your questions, and we appreciate everybody tuning into our earnings call. We are looking forward to chatting with you all next quarter, if not sooner. Thank you.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nFrom the heart of where innovation, money, and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond, this is Bloomberg Technology with Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI'm Caroline Hyde at Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI'm Ed Ludlow in San Francisco. This is Bloomberg Technology.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nComing up, the US clamps down on China's chip access with sweeping updates to export controls. We'll discuss the impact on the semiconductor industry.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nPlus, we'll bring you the latest updates from the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried as the third member of his inner circle testifies against him.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWe'll continue our conversation on the technology ecosystem right here in the Big Apple. New York Tech Week continues. First, let's check in on these markets. Actually, tech, the laggard of choice at the moment today, Ed, we're seeing the NASDAQ 100, I'm focusing on, down about 0.1%.\nYes, we know that stocks sometimes struggle in the face of rising bond yields. Actually, we saw some other areas catch a bid. Bank of America coming out with some earnings that beat, although Goldman Sachs as well and worse than had been anticipated in terms of its own profitability targets. Looking at 10-year yield pushing up once again to about 2007 highs.\nWe're anticipating the strong data that we've just seen out of the US, whether, of course, overall the macro picture looks a little bit better and what ultimately that means for the Federal Reserve. I think, unfortunately, we've just moved on a gear. We're looking at KraneShares.\nI'm looking at what's happening overall in the tech space in China. We've got the Belt and Road Initiative, the catch-up meetings there happening with world leaders, but also China, of course, itself trying to stimulate its economy while the US tries to impede some of its technological know-how. We're looking at it down some 0.75%. I know you're going to dig into that one, Ed. Let's look at some of the individual areas of risk assets that we like to focus on in tech, though.\nI want to focus on what's happening in Bitcoin because we have had, once again, a wild ride. Is Larry Fink on the side of Bitcoin? Certainly, he sees some sort of move to maybe even a solace, a place of refuge, an area to be seen as safety. That is certainly what seemed to be being talked about by the head of BlackRock. Overall, we're seeing it just up about 0.25% as we see flip-flopping around that all-important $28,000 level, Ed.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThere's a lot in the news cycle that's pushing individual stocks. Lucid, the EV maker, saw its production drop 30% quarter-on-quarter, really casting doubt about its full-year production targets for high-end EVs. That stock down almost 4%. Apple down 0.6%. It's out with a new Apple Pencil. Go out onto Apple's website and see the details. Not doing much to support the stock.\nThere is some hangover from that counterpoint research that came out 24 hours ago showing that early sales of iPhone 15 in China are not doing so well relative to iPhone 14 last year. Amazon down 0.4%. Really strong retail sales data here in the US for the month of September. Not doing much to support e-commerce-related stocks. The top story and the top mover is NVIDIA.\nA really notable move downwards after the US confirmed it is expanding export curbs relating to chip technology. That move now 3.5%. It had been at 1.7% on track for its biggest drop since early May. That said, despite shedding $60 to 70 billion of market cap, this is still a $1.1 trillion stock. All about the A800 and H800, the specific China chips that it was exporting. Let's get the details out of DC with Bloomberg's Mackenzie Hawkins. Mackenzie, we knew this was coming. Bloomberg had reported it. How is this impacting NVIDIA specifically?\n\nMackenzie Hawkins\n\nTechnology Reporter, Technology Bloomberg\n\nWhat we saw today is the Biden administration released updated regulations on these sweeping export controls that they imposed on China last year. In response to last year's curbs, NVIDIA designed chips specifically for the Chinese market that went right up to the threshold that the administration set. Now the administration has tightened that threshold to capture the chips that NVIDIA designed for China, meaning that they can't sell those chips there without a license. Their stock took a hit this morning.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt wasn't just NVIDIA that was being focused on from a business model perspective. Mackenzie, talk us through some of the AI companies that are also being targeted in China.\n\nMackenzie Hawkins\n\nTechnology Reporter, Technology Bloomberg",
    "content2": "Sure. In addition to tightening the threshold for graphics chips like NVIDIA's, you also saw the Biden administration add two AI firms that are Chinese AI startups to the entity list, which basically means overseas companies have to get a license to export and trade with those firms. One of those companies has said, we're going to appeal that decision, we strongly disagree.\nThe Chinese Foreign Minister said yesterday that we do not want the US to weaponize trade issues. This is the Biden administration clamping down on what they see as rapid advancement in China's chip industry. Beyond that, we also have to look at the equipment makers because it is not just the actual manufacturer of chips, but also the highly expensive and technical equipment required to make them. One of the key players there is Dutch company ASML. They've said that the new restrictions that were announced this morning are going to impact some of their China facilities as well.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWe're just showing on the screen, Mackenzie, ASML's response to this. These export control measures will likely have an impact on the regional split of our system sales in the medium to long-term. What was interesting about this, the whole point of codifying and updating these curbs was to address the loopholes and gray areas from last October. Yet, I think I'm right in saying that officials on the US side, Mackenzie, didn't specifically explain which chip-making equipment was going to be caught by the expanded controls.\n\nMackenzie Hawkins\n\nTechnology Reporter, Technology Bloomberg\n\nThey released the text of the rules this morning. Companies, industry analysts, and trade organizations are rapidly going through that text to identify which specific pieces of equipment are affected. In ASML's case, you'd be looking specifically at less advanced, what are called DUV machines, which are lithography machines that actually help you cut chips into a semiconductor wafer.\nThe US has to coordinate with the Netherlands on that policy because ASML is a Dutch company. It's one of the most valuable companies in Europe. One of the main loopholes of the initial export controls announced last October was that Washington went ahead, but they hadn't yet gotten Amsterdam and Tokyo on board, where some of the main chip equipment makers are located.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nA great global perspective. Mackenzie Hawkins, we thank you so much for jumping on that news of day. Meanwhile, we're going to stay over in Washington and talk globally as well because President Biden is set to travel to Israel tomorrow. Any moment now, of course, the US House itself will hold a vote on electing a new speaker. It is busy down there. Bloomberg's Katie Lyons is always all across this. First and foremost to the president and the anticipated trip at the moment. How are we anticipating this to be sort of taken by the rest of the administration, and indeed by the Republicans?\n\nMackenzie Hawkins\n\nTechnology Reporter, Technology Bloomberg\n\nWell, of course, this is something that President Biden is doing at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It's going to be a literal physical manifestation of the US's support for Israel, a show of real solidarity. It's a trip that the president is making at great personal risk. He is heading into an active war zone. There's a number of things that he is going to be trying to achieve. In addition to showing support for Israel and talking with the Israelis, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, and other leaders about what it is they need in terms of aid, he also goes there with the knowledge that there are several Americans that are understood to be hostages of Hamas.\nHe would like to see them rescued as we are on the CUSP, it seems, of an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza and also likely is going to be bringing with him a message of restraint, concern for the innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza, making sure that while the US says Israel does have a right to go after Hamas, they are taking every measure they can to protect civilian and innocent lives. Of course, there is just kind of the broader deterrent effect of him being there. They do not want this crisis to expand beyond just Israel and Gaza. It is a warning to other countries like Iran, for example, and other groups like Hezbollah, not to widen this conflict any further.\nThat's also why we're seeing the president traveling to Jordan after he is in Israel to meet with the leaders of Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, and King Abdullah.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThe administration's attention's on the Middle East, Katie, also at home. We have this House vote on the speakership. What are we expecting to happen imminently?\n\nMackenzie Hawkins\n\nTechnology Reporter, Technology Bloomberg\n\nWell, it is literally going to take place any minute. The House convenes at noon, and we're going to see if Jim Jordan has the numbers. He, of course, is the speaker designate of the Republican Conference. When he was given that on Friday, and we're seeing what's happening here in the House underway, it's just not clear that he is going to have the votes that he needs. 217 is the magic number.\nHe can only afford to lose four votes. There were more than 50 who on Friday suggested they would not vote for him on the floor. He's been whittling away at those numbers over time. He had a number of key flips, the likes of Mike Rogers, Ken Calvert, Ann Wagner, all of these kind of defense appropriation talks that he was able to bring onto his side.\nThere's still a handful of Republicans, Carlos Jimenez, Mike Lawler, Mike Kelly, Mario Díaz-Balart, who still have said that they will vote no for him. It's going to be a matter of whether he can actually get there on the first ballot. If not, if he can do it on any ballot, he's going to have to try to bring more people onto his side, knowing, of course, that we are working with a number of clocks here: Israeli aid, the need to give funding to Israel with congressional approval on the one hand, but also trying to avoid a government shutdown come 17th November on the other.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI think to that point, you sort of shift the conversation back from the imminency of this vote on the House and also what that does mean for the current direction of travel with Israel at the moment.\nJust take us to what we know in terms of the latest, the thinking, certainly from Anthony Blinken as well.\n\nMackenzie Hawkins\n\nTechnology Reporter, Technology Bloomberg\n\nWell, obviously, there is bipartisan support, Caroline, for giving Israel what it needs and for Congress really passing that aid if it needs to, knowing there are existing authorities that the Biden administration already has money that has already been appropriated, resources they can give to Israel without congressional approval.\nIf there is something that requires congressional approval, like supplemental funding requests, that's where it's going to get tricky if we still have no Speaker of the House. Keep in mind that it's not just Israel funding the administration is pushing for and trying to secure. It's others as well, including funding for Ukraine, which is a much more difficult topic among Republicans specifically in the House of Representatives. There's been growing talks here in Washington about the idea that Israel and Ukraine funding could be tied together.\nThat is something that Jim Jordan, if he does indeed get the speaker's gavel, could have a hard time getting through the House, knowing there are so many members of his party that are opposed to any additional funding going to Ukraine. It's going to be a thorny subject to navigate if Ukraine and Israel do get lumped together, even though there is that support there for Israel.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nKatie Lyons, thank you across all of the moving parts that are currently occurring in Washington. I mean, we've been talking about Israel, of course, from the politics, from the conflict, but at the moment, also the implications within technology. Actually, there's some notable news out that we understand Israel is in talks with Elon Musk's SpaceX to set up a Starlink satellite network to bolster communications.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, this is an announcement from Israel's Communications Ministry. It's important to note, if you go on the Starlink website and look at the map of coverage, Starlink is not currently available in Israel or indeed in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. We have not heard from SpaceX or received comment from them on this story. The idea that the Israelis are outlining is it will keep those towns on the front line with a reliable internet connection as this war with Hamas continues.\nThe other story that we're continuing to follow related to the Israel-Hamas war, Y Combinator's Gary Tan, Sequoia Capital's Ravi Gupta, and several other prominent venture capitalists have canceled plans to attend Web Summit, the biggest technology conference in Europe. It follows comments by the conference's CEO that slammed Western support for Israel after the Hamas attacks. Caroline, important to note that this morning, Paddy Cosgrave, the CEO of Web Summit, through a blog post, initialed an apology for those original comments that he'd made, I think, on X.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, he certainly did walk back from some of his initial viewpoints. I think it was notable that they do say that some VCs have stepped back, also some areas, European venture capitalists as well, from attending the event. I think actually Web Summit came out and said actually Monday had a lot of people signing up to attend the event, the busiest Monday that they'd had in terms of attendance registrations.\nIndeed, some VCs had signed up to attend as well. Overall, this really does just show that people are having to navigate really how they communicate with indeed their own customer base, how they communicate with the broader world on X at the moment, as indeed Paddy Cosgrave himself is having to do.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, I think he posted onto that platform X, saying he's going to be taking a timeout from the platform where he'd originally made his views known.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nMeanwhile, no timeout for us because we're going to see the latest on the FTX trial and what it all means for the future, indeed, of the crypto space. We're going to be joined by Sandra Ro, CEO of Global Blockchain Business Council. That's next. This is Bloomberg Technology.\nNishad Singh, now he's the Former Director of Engineering at FTX, is facing cross-examination at the Sam Bankman-Fried trial today. Over the course of earlier questioning, Singh said that he was intimidated by Bankman-Fried and at times humiliated by him. Let's bring in Hannah Miller for more on really the way in which these testimonies are unfolding. At the moment, it really feels as if this was a pretty rocky relationship, certainly towards the end of FTX's, well, fallout, it would seem.\n\nHannah Miller\n\nMedia Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\n100%. Yeah, we're getting an inside look at what happened in FTX during the collapse, both in the offices and in the $30 million penthouse that Sam Bankman-Fried shared with his close friends and executives.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHannah, one interesting piece, particularly from sort of the prosecution standpoint, is what Nishad Singh is saying about when he learned about the financial difficulties that FTX was in. What did we learn in the courtroom?\n\nHannah Miller\n\nMedia Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWe know that it was an extremely stressful situation for him, that this was really devastating. We know he made a plea deal pretty early on. He did flip early on Bankman-Fried. We also know that he had a close personal relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried's younger brother. This was more than professional. This was a personal connection between the two.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat's interesting to me is the timing of this, that in his testimony, Singh says he only learned about the $8 billion hole in the company's balance sheet two months before everything fell apart. Where are we at in this trial? It's hard as a reporter, and I've been in those courtrooms, I know, to kind of weigh the evidence. Are we near the end of the process, at least, of what we expect to come?\n\nHannah Miller\n\nMedia Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, our latest updated estimate for the verdict is around 8 November 2023. This is an evolving situation, and things can change. We do have that potential witness list, but that could be adjusted. There are still many colorful characters and people close to Sam Bankman-Fried who are set to testify.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI think what we're also getting is a story of it seems as though the prosecution is trying to identify so-called flashiness, excess done by Sam Bankman-Fried. It feels as though perhaps we're hearing from Singh some corroboration of that. He's saying that Sam Bankman-Fried's approach to spending on investments in real estate and celebrity endorsements was excessive, but also just the fact that they were kind of left out of the loop on many of these deals until after the fact.\n\nHannah Miller\n\nMedia Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, a lot of what the prosecution has been doing has been showing the luxe lifestyle that Sam Bankman-Fried and the other FTX executives pursued. Meanwhile, the defense has tried arguing that Sam Bankman-Fried was your regular math nerd, that he didn't like this life of luxury. Really, we've seen with Singh's testimony about living in this $30 million penthouse in the Bahamas that all of these executives got to enjoy a life of riches.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right, Bloomberg's Hannah Miller, terrific, up-to-the-minute reporting here in SF. Thank you very much. Let's keep the conversation going with Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, a Swiss-based nonprofit with more than 500 institutional members. Essentially, you're dedicated to furthering adoption of blockchain technology, which this trial kind of puts a macro spotlight on. It's kind of an interesting real-time play on the rule of law, right? We are seeing that happen in this country. As you sit there representing your industry, what do you think the outcome will mean for your industry?\n\nSandra Ro\n\nCEO, Global Blockchain Business Council\n\nFraud is fraud. The trial underscores the importance of enforcement being able to do its job to weed out financial crimes. As the indictment, if it's proven that in this trial that financial crimes have been committed, the US is based on rule of law, and that is a good thing. We will see the outcome of that shortly, it seems. For the industry, I will say this: less hype, less noise, less bad actors, the better for the good innovators, and those who are trying to do the right thing, which includes responsible innovation and consumer protection going hand-in-hand.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nTalking of noise, though, there was a bit of noise surrounding, well, future sign-offs of spot ETFs yesterday. It made for a little bit of volatility in the OG of the crypto world that is Bitcoin because there was some expectation that the SEC might sign off on BlackRock's ETF proposal. Of course, that was dampened down by the SEC itself saying, don't believe everything on the internet. Sandra, how much are you navigating this current noise and expectation in the market?\n\nSandra Ro\n\nCEO, Global Blockchain Business Council\n\nWith the organization that we have, which has Fortune 500s across to layer one blockchains, to crypto firms, to startups, we have to navigate a world where we focus on what is the problem people are solving for, how is this technology actually useful for society, and frankly, what is the positive impact to society. For us, it's really about getting down to bread and butter, what real-world problems are being solved for, and how can these technology tools be used for furthering solutions that are positive impact.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSandra, in parallel, we have this sort of industry-defining trial that will have ramifications for your industry. We also wait to learn about approval, right, for products that expand digital asset reach. Give us your sort of state of the industry health check right now. When you and all of your members gather, are these positive conversations you're having, or are you all down in the doldrums right now about the health of your industry?\n\nSandra Ro\n\nCEO, Global Blockchain Business Council\n\nAs you can imagine, with a group as large as ours, one size does not fit all. The focus is really widening the aperture of discussion from our point of view, which is every industry sector is likely to be affected by things going digital. In a world where everything is going digital, including money and financial products, what does that mean, and what are the implications for each industry sector, whether we're talking about supply chain, digital identity, wallets, and ultimately investing?\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nDo you think ultimately that amid all the noise, you are able to show real-world applications that do problem-solve? You sit on so many boards. I'm looking at how you're on the World Economic Forum's Digital Currency Governance. You're also on Filecoin, for example, but you're doing things within the EU public funds, and new green economy. What problems need to be resonated to be solved here for basically crypto and decentralized finance to sort of win hearts and minds a little bit more?\n\nSandra Ro\n\nCEO, Global Blockchain Business Council\n\nI think it's getting back to basics. Are you actually helping to solve real-world problems? I'll give one example of a project we have going on right now with the UN World Food Program. Billions of dollars of donor funds go into the system across the development world. There is very little visibility around making sure that there is a 360-degree accountability on the fact that wherever it was supposed to go, it actually went to that city, village, or community. I\nthink we need to think about how we design systems to allow for that accountability. It is not about being big brother. There needs to be human rights and consumer protection built into the design. Ultimately, we need to think about how we affect positive transparency and build trust.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSandra Ro, great to have some time with the CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council. We thank you so much. From New York and San Francisco, this is Bloomberg Technology.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right, time for Talking Tech. First up, TSMC is axing plans to build an advanced chip plant in North Taiwan. The pullback comes after reports of growing local protests. Alibaba and Tencent participated in a $300 million round for AI startup Baidu, one of the more prominent startups hoping to compete with the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. Plus, Apple CEO Tim Cook made a special appearance at a Tencent gaming tournament in China. This comes amid reports of slower-than-expected sales of the iPhone 15, and increased competition from China's Huawei. Caroline.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nMeanwhile, we're going to be talking about, well, tech, right here in the city of New York. It's tech week upon us. We're going to sit down with some of the participants from Everywhere Ventures. That's next. Watching shares, meanwhile, of Amazon, Jeff Bezos regains his spot as second richest person in the world, passing LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, of course. We're trading flat on the day. He's now worth $156 billion. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Caroline Hyde, New York.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI'm Ed Ludlow in San Francisco. A quick check on the markets because in the last few minutes, literally, the NASDAQ 100 has turned positive, up just a tenth of 1%. We got stronger-than-expected retail data in the month of September. The logic the market's following is that strong economic data raises bets on the Fed holding interest rates higher for longer. We all know the story, what higher rates mean for the technology sector.\nLooking at the NASDAQ 100, around 70 names in the green, still around 30 in the red. We continue to track that. Of course, one big mover to the downside is NVIDIA after the US expanded curbs on chip technology exports. That specifically impacted NVIDIA. Names moving to the upside, Meta, Adobe, Tesla, all from a points perspective, moving the NASDAQ 100 higher. A lot of Fed speak this week. We get China GDP Wednesday. We've got a lot to think about, Carol.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWe do. Actually, there's also the micro to think about if you're living right here in New York City at the moment because tech week is actually upon us, officially underway. The industry is gathering for so many hundreds of events and panels all week long. To kick off this event, we sat down with members of Andreessen to hear about why Andreessen Horowitz in New York remains an important tech hub.\n\n[Company Representative] (Andreessen Horowitz)\n\nCompany Representative, Andreessen Horowitz\n\nI've always believed that opportunities live between fields of expertise. I really enjoy exploring those intersections. I think it really is a metaphor for New York City because technology has a tendency of cutting across industries. I think the companies that really represent New York best are those that really live at the intersection between technology and many of the large, incumbent industries that exist here in New York, whether that's media, advertising, fashion, or financial services.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nLet's get more thoughts from the New York tech scene and ecosystem in and of itself. Jenny Fielding is here with us, managing partner at Everywhere Ventures. What's so fascinating is your whole MO of Everywhere Ventures is that technology is everywhere, founders are everywhere. You have based yourself here in New York, and you've been growing tech businesses since 2007 here. How has it changed from your perspective?\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nYeah, well, I'm a born-and-raised New Yorker. When I set out to start my first tech company in 2007, everyone said to me, this is a terrible place to start a software company. I looked around and I said, really? There's incredible talent here. We have some of the best engineering schools, we have capital, maybe we don't have venture capital, but we have Wall Street, we have real estate, we have every multinational is here. I dug in my heels and I built my company here while everyone really was heading out West. Now, it's taken a long time for our ecosystem to develop, but it really is such a thriving ecosystem. It's taken time from 2007 to now, more than 15 years to get where we are.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt is now, I think, in terms of number of venture capital deals being signed. It's like second just behind San Francisco and the Bay Area. What has been sort of a real catalyst? We know that there have been the Datadogs, the MongoDBs, the exits that re-put money back into New York where they were grown. Has that particularly helped, or has that carved too much of a niche in data in particular?\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nYeah, I mean, it's been really amazing to see how the IPOs have catalyzed our ecosystem. For example, those founders, they make a bunch of money. Not just the founders, think about the founding teams. What do they do? Sure, maybe they buy a nice house, but they put it right back into the startup ecosystem. We see that every day. What's interesting about our fund is we raise all of our capital from LPs who are all founders and operators. While most people are investing or raising from institutions, we're raising from our community. That's a real kind of new ethos here. We've seen it in the Bay Area for many generations, and now it's really starting to come here. We call it this kind of founder flywheel.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nJenny, what's the New York City founder playbook? The story in Silicon Valley and San Francisco is you've gone to Stanford or Berkeley, you may drop out, but you can find yourself a garage or a space, get capital from VCs here, and grow quite quickly. Explain to me what's happening in real terms on the ground in New York City, in the wider New York area.\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nYeah, well, again, I really want to stress this word ecosystem. It's not just about what the venture capitalists are doing, but what about the universities? I am an adjunct professor at both Cornell Tech and Columbia University, who have incredible programs that are supporting entrepreneurship, that are encouraging students to not just go to the traditional places. When I was a student, everyone went to Goldman, JPMorgan, and McKinsey. Now we're encouraging students to come out and start companies. It's a very different culture here in New York than it was when I started, and it's quite exciting.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIs what we're seeing happen in AI here on the West Coast happening in New York? There are companies being founded in this city every day. The PitchBook data shows 50% of the capital going to San Francisco-based startups. Is there still some energy being created by AI in New York?\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nListen, again, getting back to universities, we have incredible labs here across our universities. That's spawning some of the best technologists, up-and-coming technologists. I just hosted a pre-seed founder breakfast with AWS. I would say 75% of the founders there pitched me an AI startup or AI-powered. It is happening here. It is true that some of the larger infrastructure plays, whether it's OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google, are on the West Coast. I think we have a real opportunity to catch up.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat's the state? What's the city doing to help perpetuate this? Because some would say, oh, New York's actually pushing back against Airbnb. It's looking at regulating AI, at least in the application of jobs and hiring. How are they managing to do that balancing act?\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nYeah, it's a great question. I happen to chair the advisory board of New York Ventures. That is the venture fund for the state of New York. They have just announced a $100 million fund to invest in emerging managers. These are new managers who are out there supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs. They're putting money into these new innovators who are then, again, investing in companies in New York. I think the state is really across the state making a big impact. I just came from a competition called 43 North up in Buffalo where they just gave out $5 million to five companies that are moving to Buffalo, starting their new companies, many actually in AI. We're excited to see all of the catalyzing across the state.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, it is a state element. What's interesting, Tech NYC, who's sort of helping galvanize this week alongside Andreessen Horowitz, they're like, they've got some interesting data when it comes to the breakdown of founders. I'm interested in whether or not it's anecdotal. It seems to be from the data Tech NYC is showing. Actually, founders happen to be more diverse here in New York. That's, of course, a reflection of what the city looks like, the people it makes up. Is it diverse enough? Are you seeing improvements in that respect?\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nI'm hosting a female founder lunch on Friday. We had 1,000 women apply. Unfortunately, we have 50 spots for lunch. It is absolutely incredible what we're seeing here in New York. We're seeing incredible diversity across all walks of life, and we're really excited about it. I don't think it's just talk. I think women are coming out of incredible universities and companies, and there's capital there for them.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nJenny, what your industry colleagues at Andreessen Horowitz outlined for us on yesterday's show was New York being good at applying technology to mature industries like finance, in other words, FinTech, but also BioTech. Are there any examples where you've experienced that technology offering a solution for a legacy or long-standing industry?\n\nJenny Fielding\n\nManaging Partner, Everywhere Ventures\n\nYeah, I mean, those are two of our large areas, both FinTech, healthcare. I think the other one that we're focused on is future of work and automation. Oftentimes this plays out in what we call vertical SaaS. These are antiquated industries, whether it's around supply chain and the like, where new technologies, AI, are coming in to make everything more efficient. The areas, again, that we focus on, FinTech that you spoke to David about yesterday, healthcare, and future of work automation, these are critical to the city. These are old, antiquated industries that are being updated through tech.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nJenny Fielding of Everywhere Ventures, really great to have you back on the show. We thank you. Go get busy with some of your breakfast and dinners, it would seem.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, busy week out in New York City. Coming up here on the show, today's VC spotlight. We're going to talk all things FinTech, as we were just discussing, the CEO of Coterie, Ethan Agarwal, coming up next. This is Bloomberg Technology.\nIn today's VC spotlight, we're going to take a look at Coterie, a FinTech company with $500 million assets under management. It helps individual investors manage their investments in alternatives like venture capital funds, private equity, and more. As of today, they also offer performance data, capital call payments, and tax reporting services. CEO Ethan Agarwal joins us here in San Francisco. That was the origin, right, allowing individuals to write smaller checks, get in on those rounds that you've never been able to get in on.\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nExactly. If you take a step back, like, why do we invest in the first place? We have a vision for the future. We think the future can be better than today. We do not want to say we want to invest. We think investors are optimists, savers are pessimists. What we started to do is say, let's democratize access to an asset class that has been previously limited to really large pension plans or really large endowments. Let's make that available to an average retail investor. That is what we started on. That is what we focused on.\nIn the last 24 months, we have seen that proliferate. There are a lot of different companies that are offering access. What we realized, though, when we got really deep into it, is that it is actually the tooling that is completely broken. As an individual investor, it's basically impossible to manage your capital calls, your performance reporting, your tax documents. If you're an individual investor in multiple funds logging into multiple portals, it's an absolute disaster.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat does an individual investor look like? Private equity aside, which has kind of been hurt by rates, everyone's kind of clamoring for the private investor as an LP, high net worth individual. Who are you talking about here, the everyday person or the multi-millionaire?\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nYeah, we're talking about a credit investor as an above. The SEC defines that as a $1 million net worth or $200,000 of income. What's beautiful about this is the demand is coming on both sides. Not only are individual investors looking to allocate more capital to alternative asset classes, the funds themselves are looking for more retail investors.\nIf you look at KKR, they said they expect 40% of their subsequent capital raises to come from individuals. Same with Carlyle, same with Blackstone, same with TPG. The funds are looking for a match on the retail side. Our view is that the products, the tools, the solutions need to be dramatically improved in order for retail investors to be able to invest in these alternative asset classes.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou're talking to individual investors. You're also talking, though, to GPs and indeed the administrators of the funds. What are you hearing from them? How quickly are they onboarding with you?\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nVery quickly. It's incredible, the GPs, you know, the LPs, like I'm an LP in five different funds, but I have a full-time day job. People who are GPs in funds, they have their entire net worth tied up in the carry of their own fund. They have no idea what is that fund marked at, what are the significant companies, what are the marks of those individual companies.\nThese are people that are saving for their kids' college tuition in the future, but don't know what those portfolios look like. What we did is we built a product that helps GPs, that helps LPs understand what exactly they're exposed to, what are their MOICs, and helps them look at analysis that they have never seen before when they were just downloading a PDF or a capital account statement from an antiquated portal.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou have raised money, of course, yourself, not only managing the money of others. How has your own business been going in this what has been a more difficult environment? Have you been having to focus on ensuring that your revenue-positive profitability are focused? Indeed, are you looking to raise more money?\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nWe have managed quite well. I mean, look, this is my second time around. We have a team of exceptional co-founders I have, and investors, so we have lots of runway. The company has been performing very well. My view on raising capital is raise as much as you can whenever you can. In the market today, it just doesn't make sense.\nWhen the market warms up a little bit, obviously with a ten-year at 4.7%, where are we going to get VC dollars from that are not obscenely expensive? Our view is perform really well. The market will warm up, and then we'll go raise capital opportunistically. You never want to raise capital when you need to. You raise it when you want to. Right now, we neither need to nor want to.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nEthan, what is it that Coterie has, technologically speaking, beyond a database? Are you a tech company?\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nWe are only a tech company.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHow so?\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nWe don't employ advisors, for example. We don't employ anybody who is not a software engineer. The advisory model, even in FinTech, in new wealth tech, doesn't really work because people are not looking for a commission-based structure, or even an AUM-based structure. What you'll find with a lot of wealth advisors, or even some of the larger folks, you saw Goldman reported earnings this morning.\nWhat they're saying is, we are going to try to get you to give us your alternatives as a management so that we can charge you 50 bps on it. There's no need to charge 50 bps on something where you're paying capital calls and reporting on PDFs. That's why our payment structure is fixed. We charge a fixed $100 per year per fund, regardless of how big the structure is. The way that we can do that is by having software. If we had people behind us, it would be incredibly expensive. There is no way that we could deliver that product. The only way we can do that with the significant margins that we have is through software.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI like it. The Coterie CEO talking how much they are in deep tech. Ethan Agarwal, thanks so much for your time today. We appreciate it.\n\nEthan Agarwal\n\nCEO, Coterie\n\nThank you.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nMeanwhile, coming up, we're going to talk about times getting tough for the Swedish company Volta Trucks. It's part of the bankruptcy. We'll tell you why next. You've got to look at some particular areas of trucking.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, we're looking at General Motors. The stock higher 1.1%. It did a little puke and dropped after headlines hit that it's delaying expansion of electric truck production to late 2025. What that means in practice is GM delaying the opening of its second electric truck plant, which was due to be in Michigan. The idea here is GM is trying to preserve capital.\nThey've committed tens of billions of dollars to electrification, and they're just pulling back a little bit, saying it's based on enormous demand and them needing to rethink the strategy. That stock up 1.1%. You see the little dip there while we're on during the show. This is Bloomberg Technology. Swedish electric truck company Volta Trucks is planning to file for bankruptcy following a breakdown in its supply chain.\nThe company said the decision comes roughly two months after Volta's battery supplier, Proterra, failed, causing the truck maker to fall short of its production targets. Bring in Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst, Maynie Yang, for more out of London. Maynie, simple story. Supply chain broke down. Volta can't go into production. How difficult is it, in your assessment, to quickly pivot to a new battery supplier?\n\nMaynie Yang\n\nAnalyst, Bloomberg New Energy Finance\n\nI think it really depends if the company has any existing relationships. Of course, a lot is uncertain at the moment. I guess we see that battery costs are a major factor in the high upfront cost of electric trucks, which is kind of the major factor deterring wider adoption at present because TCO costs are lower for trucks. In terms of batteries, we kind of see two major segues globally.\nFor example, a lot of the market is sourced from Chinese battery makers that typically do cheaper LFP batteries, whereas another part of the market sources from Korean battery makers doing NCM and NCA, which is higher in energy density, but also higher in cost. Previously, yeah, Volta was supplying from Proterra, which was sourcing from Samsung with NCM and NCA chemistry. We're seeing more companies in the market, for example, gravitate towards LFP in order to reduce costs.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nFascinating supply chain story. We thank you so much. Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst, Maynie Yang, staying late for us in London. We really appreciate it. Meanwhile, we're going to do a bit of a heart pivot, but I guess there is certainly AI within EV and self-driving trucks. Let's do it. AI next. Baidu's Founder, Robin Li, declaring his company's large language model has finally caught up with OpenAI's advanced GPT-4. In fact, he's claiming that the lead in his country's race to develop AI, they can rival the United States. Bring in our resident expert, Rachel Metz, for more. What sort of data, what proof points, what show and tell is Robin using to prove this?\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, they did a presentation live. That's often a good test of these systems. Because they're planning in advance what they're going to do in these tests, that can make it a little bit hard to tell exactly how well it works, right, unless something goes horribly wrong. Then you would know it's not working well. One thing that I think is super interesting about this is you have so many of these large language models and chatbots that are trained on so much of the internet that is written in English.\nIt's really interesting to see companies working on models that are trained more and meant more for non-English speaking markets. That's something that we're starting to see increasingly. I think it'll be very interesting to watch and see how people are using this and how well they're finding it works for all kinds of things.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHow much consumer enthusiasm has there been for these, well, in your hand, viral chatbots? I mean, there's more than 180 million or something using ChatGPT in the US. What are the likes and demands for ERNIE, for example?\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI mean, I think that it's something that people want to use for a range of things. Some of it kind of reminds me of the early days of the App Store with the iPhone, for instance, or the early days of Android phones and apps where you're not entirely sure what you're going to do with it, but you'll probably figure out some interesting things that might not have even been what was expected. One of the interesting and cool things about putting these onto phones is that it encourages people to use them in more contexts where you might not be in front of a computer, like a laptop or even an iPad, like when you're driving, for instance, or if you're in the kitchen making some food.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt's worth noting that Baidu is down significantly in this session, 4%. That's largely to do with the expanded US chip technology export curbs, which ultimately have the goal of blocking access to technology related to AI. What Li said was that ERNIE is not inferior to GPT-4 from OpenAI. Okay, what is it that GPT-4 can do if we're to compare them?\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIf we're to compare them? I mean, that's part of what's really fascinating here is that OpenAI keeps elevating ChatGPT. I mean, it's gained capabilities that they had announced previously, but they hadn't been laid out initially. Like you can now give it an image and say, describe what's in this image. Things like that could be really helpful for a range of uses, from helping people with visual disabilities to helping you pick out an outfit.\nIf they can do something like that with ERNIE Bot, that could be potentially useful. What I'm not sure about, though, is there are also lots of problems with ChatGPT. It's also hard to know when it's telling the truth, so to speak, how often it's making things up. It remains to be seen how accurate ERNIE Bot is. I guess we're just going to have to wait.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYep. ChatGPT as a wardrobe assistant. Interesting use case. Bloomberg's Rachel Metz, thank you very much, Caro.\n\nCaroline Hyde\n\nNews Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nNo end of applications. Not doing yours yet, though, Ed. Meanwhile, that does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nDon't forget to check out the podcast. Thank you for listening to the podcast. Those of you that tune in, we're on Apple, Spotify, and also, of course, all the Bloomberg platforms. Also, check out the show on YouTube. Watch it back. A lot of information in there from what's a busy news kind of day from New York City and San Francisco. This is Bloomberg Technology.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nThat are way above any model scale that we have today, but above some certain capability threshold. I think you should need to go through a certification process for that. I think there should be external audits, and safety tests. We do this for lots of other industries where we care about safety.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nElon Musk has said you started OpenAI. You both started OpenAI because he was scared of Google. Is Google still a threat?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nGoogle is unbelievably competent. It seems like they are focused with an intensity Google has not seen in a while on AI.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThey're still scary?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nThey are a company that I don't think anyone should ever write off.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nNow, obviously, we've seen all the barbs that you and Elon have been trading in public and in interviews.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI don't really.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, you're responding. You're responding. You get asked about it by people like me, to be fair.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nMostly people like you, to be honest. Most other people ask about the technology, that is true.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhy do you think he's so frustrated or disappointed with the direction that OpenAI has gone?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI mean, you should ask him. He can give you a better answer than I can speculate.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSo.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI really am happy to talk about this. This is the most important topic. We can spend the rest of the time on it.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nDon't worry, not the rest of the time. Just some.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI think he really cares about AI safety a lot. I think that's where it's coming from, a good place. He just, we have differences of opinion on some parts, but I think we both care about that. He wants to make sure we have, the world has, the maximal chance at a good outcome.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou're not worried he's going to call you to come to some cage match in the Vegas Octagon?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI don't think I would.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\n[inaudible] Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI would go watch if he and Zuck actually did that.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right. Well, it's supposedly happening between him and Zuck.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nCrazy.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI think there will be quite an audience. Look, much has been made of the Microsoft relationship. It's not just him. He has said he's worried that Microsoft has more control than the leadership at OpenAI realizes and that they could cut you off at any time. Is that true?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI mean, I think what he means is that they could break the contract, and take away our access to the data center.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nA lot of money that you have access to, right?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nWe have money. It's the data center that they operate for us. I don't think that's a likely scenario for a bunch of reasons.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHow would you characterize the relationship with Microsoft?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nWe think it's great. I mean, like any deep, complex relationship, it's not without its challenges, but it's really great. It is by far the best major partnership I've ever been a part of. It's kind of like on both sides, it was kind of a crazy thing to jump into, and it's surprising that it worked this well. If you just look at the results for both companies, we're very happy.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIn 2018, that's the last time I believe we talked in person, you told me you thought AI would help us be our best, but also stop our worst impulses. What makes you confident about that? Because so many times, time and time again, it feels like technology has only amplified our worst.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYeah. To be clear, it will do bad things, too. I don't have this only good view of it. I think, realistically, like other technologies, it's human nature to talk about the bad more than the good. I think we can look at other technologies that have done a lot of good and plenty of harm and talk 99% about the harm and 1% about the good. I do that, too. I think that's understandable. In 2018, that was way before the GPT series was kind of a thing. At that point, we had some inkling it was going to go like this. We certainly didn't know exactly. I think now what we're heading to is this personal tool that can help you in whatever way you'd like.\nOne of the fun parts of the trip was how diverse and broad the stories are of how people are using it to be better at whatever they want to be better at, and to help them with things they want to improve. I think if you go talk to ChatGPT users, you'll find a lot of support for that comment from 2018. You can also find people who are misusing it or unhappy with it.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology",
    "content3": "The reality check, though, is that you're building this on the back of human data. That is bias, that is racist, that is sexist, that is emotional, that is wrong. A lot of it is wrong.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nFor sure.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHow do you safeguard against that?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nThere was a recent study that GPT-4, the model that is released, is less biased on implicit bias tests than humans, even humans who think they've really trained themselves to be good at this. If you look at the model that comes out of the pre-training process, that model will be quite biased, and it'll reflect the internet. Reinforcement learning from human feedback, one of the techniques we use to align the models, works quite well. If you look at the progress from model to model, even some of our biggest critics are like, wow, they've gotten quite a lot of the bias out of the model. I think models like this can be a force for reducing bias in the world, not for enhancing it. Now, there's questions about what if a user wants to use the model in a very biased way.\nHow much control do you give a user? Who decides what the limits of the value system are? That'll be a tough question for society to wrestle with. There's not an obvious one-sense, neatly buttoned-up answer. The technology, I think, has gone much further than people thought it was going to in terms of being able to align these models to behave in certain ways.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou and I have been talking going all the way back to your [inaudible] at YC. It's been fun to watch that journey. I think people really want to understand your incentives and don't necessarily understand your incentives. People are perplexed. I've asked a lot of people what I should ask you.\nOK.\nThey're perplexed that you have no equity. Can you explain that a little? Is there any financial structure whereby you do benefit if OpenAI is a big thing?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYeah, I get why people are perplexed about this. I have wondered if I should just take one share of equity, so I never have to answer this question again. A few things. One, we're governed by a nonprofit, of which I'm a board member, and our Board needs to have a majority of disinterested directors who don't have equity in the company. I originally didn't do it for that reason. I was like, I don't think about it.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAre there any financial incentives at a certain benchmark?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nNo, I mean, I have a tiny bit of exposure via the YC investment, but it's immaterial.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nTo be clear, if OpenAI is massively profitable, you won't benefit financially.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nOne of the takeaways I've learned from questions like this is that this concept of having enough money is not something that is easy to get across to other people.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHard for people to understand. Hard for people to understand.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI have enough money. I'm going to make way, way more from other investments that I've made in the past. If I had just taken the equity and signed the giving pledge, people would be like, that's great. That makes sense. It would have had the same I'm pre-giving away the money here because it goes to the OpenAI nonprofit. I trust OpenAI nonprofits do a good thing with it.\nI have enough money. What I want more of is an interesting life impact, access to be in the room for interesting conversations. I still get a lot of selfish benefit from this. What else am I going to do with my time? This is really great. I cannot imagine a more interesting life than this one and a more interesting thing to work on. I get a ton of benefit. Yes, somehow this idea of having enough money just doesn't compute for people.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIf it's not about money, is it about power? Is it about control?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI want to make my contribution back to human technological progress. I get to benefit from all of this stuff that people did before. I get to use this iPhone that I still marvel at every day, all of the work that had to go into that in the human tech tree.\nThose people, I do not know who they are. I am very grateful to them. They knew they were never going to get recognition from me personally, but they also wanted to do something to contribute. So do I. I cannot imagine better compensation than that feeling. It would be maybe weird if I had not already made a bunch of money and, again, planned to make way more from other investments. I just do not think about it.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI think this will be, like, I think this will be the most important step yet that humanity has to get through with technology. I really care about that.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat is one question that you really wish people like me asked?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI want to hear about Elon and equity, and the personal drama of the day.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSeriously, I understand you are getting a lot of those questions.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nNo, I'm happy to talk about it. I'm always excited to just talk about what can happen in the coming few years and few decades with the technology.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat are we all going to do when we have nothing to do?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI mean, talk about Elon and Zuckerberg.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nZucker, please.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nNo, I don't think we ever run out of things to do. I think it's deeply in our nature to want to create, to want to be useful, to want to feel the fulfillment of doing something that matters. If you talk to people from thousands of years ago, hundreds of years ago even, the work that we do now would have seemed unimaginable at best and probably trivial.\nThis is not directly necessary for our survival in the sense of creating food or whatever. This shift happens with every technological revolution, every time we worry about what people are going to do on the other side, and every time we find things. I suspect not only will this time not be an exception to that, the things we find will be better, more interesting, and more impactful than ever before.\nThere are a lot of people that talk about AI as the last technological revolution. I suspect from the other side, it'll look like the first. The other stuff will be so small in comparison. I think the whole thing of technological revolutions is sort of dumb, because my understanding has always been it's just one long continuous one. It is discontinuing exponential. What will be enabled and the stuff we can't even imagine on the other side, we will have way too much to do. If you want to just sit around doing nothing, that'll be fine too.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right. All right. Bonbons and beaches in my future. That's what I want.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI don't think that's what you'll turn out to want. If you do, great.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou talked about AIs designing other AIs on the tour. Can you play that out for us, and the implications of that?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYeah. I mean, this is the classic sci-fi idea that at some point, these systems can help progress themselves, can discover better architectures, can help write their own code. I think we're a ways away from that, but it is worth paying attention to.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah, China and Russia, you didn't go there on your trip.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI did speak. I gave the keynote at the Chinese conference.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou did speak virtually.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYeah.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhere do you think they are on AI? Should we be worried?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nI don't really know. I'd love to have better information on that. I don't have a great sense.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nDoes it concern you that we don't know?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYeah. I mean, again, imperfect information always is a little concerning. I'd love to have a better sense. I'm optimistic that we can find some sort of collaborative thing. I think this thing that often gets said in the US, which is like it's impossible to cooperate with China, it's just totally off the table, is asserted as fact. People are trying to will it into existence. It's not clear to me it's true. In fact, I suspect it's not.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nIt was hard.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nRight. Right. Right. Look, I'm so grateful that you've been around the world talking about this. I'm so grateful that you're with us today. I think even you would acknowledge you have an incredible amount of power at this moment in time. Why should we trust you?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYou shouldn't. As you've known me for a long time, public talking, I'd rather be in the office working. I think at this moment in time, people deserve basically as much time asking questions as they want. I'm trying to show up and do it. More to that, no one person should be trusted here. I don't have super voting shares. I don't want them. The board can fire me. I think that's important.\nI think the Board over time needs to get democratized to all of humanity. There are many ways that could be implemented. The reason for our structure and the reason it's so weird, and one of the consequences of that weirdness is me ending up with no equity, is we think this technology, the benefits, the access to it, the governance of it belongs to humanity as a whole. If this really works, it's quite a powerful technology. You should not trust one company, and certainly not one person, with it.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhy should we trust OpenAI? Are you saying we shouldn't?\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nNo, I think you should trust OpenAI, but only if OpenAI is doing these sorts of things. If we're years down the road and have not sort of figured out how to start democratizing control, then I think you shouldn't. If we figure out some sort of new structure where OpenAI is governed by humanity, and that can happen in many ways, including the alignment data set we pick rather than us picking it, we find a way to get it from humanity as a whole. That could mean actual board control. There are many ways that could be implemented. We're talking to a lot of people about what that could look like. If we don't do that, I don't think just trust us is good enough.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, thank you for explaining why we should maybe consider trusting you. You have a plane to catch. We're so grateful for your time.\nThank you very much for having me.\nThank you so much.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nFor sure.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nNow we are going to follow that with the Co-Founders of Inflection AI, Reid Hoffman, and Mustafa Suleyman, as well as my colleague Brad Stone.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right. Well, Mustafa, Reid Hoffman, thank you guys for joining us. Mustafa, you're a Co-Founder of DeepMind, now a division of Google. You're the author of a forthcoming book, The Coming Wave. Reid, legendary venture capitalist, you're an early investor in OpenAI. Also an author of a book called Impromptu. The books are available for everyone. Thank you both.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhich you wrote with AI, right?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nYes. Impromptu, first book on AI co-written with an AI.\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nYes. ChatGPT 4 will be doing a signing.\nAll you have to do is go to the web prompt. You're the Co-Founders of a company called Inflection AI. Guys, it's raining chatbots these days from OpenAI, well-funded startups, all the big tech companies. Tell us, Mustafa, maybe you start. What is the play here with Inflection AI?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nI think this is unquestionably going to be the most radical transformation of our lifetimes. I mean, there are going to be AIs for all sorts of things, for businesses, for brands, for digital influencers. Our belief is that everyone is also going to have a personal AI, one that is aligned to your interests, on your team, in your corner, gets to know you, and really forms a trusted relationship with you over time.\nIt'll be like a confidant, a consigliere there for you when you need to make tough decisions, but also a chief of staff, scheduling, organizing, prioritizing, booking. Your AI is really going to be your digital representative, negotiating on your behalf, interacting with other sales AIs that are trying to encourage you to buy something, and helping you to get a great deal. For example, it's the whole set of things. For example, one of the things I just found out yesterday is one of our team members at Greylock actually, in fact, is using Pi for parenting advice.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOh, cool.\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nRight, which is really awesome. That's the kind of thing where you're like, great.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nReid, why is this an opportunity for a startup, isn't a Microsoft or a Google Bard just a little closer to the customer and in a better position to offer that personal digital assistant?\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nWell, part of what's, I mean, obviously, I am on the Board of Microsoft and was on the Board of OpenAI. Part of the thing is what I love about startups is that you have a unique vision where you're unfettered by the other aspects of your business, and you're building it. Part of the idea that Mustafa and the entire Inflection team kind of came up with, and I have a little bit of fingerprints here too, is that IQ is not the only thing that matters here. EQ matters as well. How do you have this personal intelligence, Pi, be helpful to you, obviously very high-end IQ, but also EQ?\nThat was one of the reasons I used the parenting example, because obviously, there's a question of how you do it, but it's also how you connect with people, what you do in order to amplify that. I think that's one of the things that the Inflection folks are doing better than everyone else.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nCan we talk about the EQ thing? I asked Pi what we should ask you. It's questions. We're fine. I was like, are you going to tell them that we had this conversation? It responded, \"Ha ha, I'm just a computer program. I can't tell anyone anything, but I assure you our conversations are confidential.\" I do think it's pretty cool that we're having this meta conversation about your interview with my creators. That's the major point. It was actually the personality that shocked me. Can you explain how you designed that?\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nI mean, we've deliberately designed it to be patient, curious, kind. One of the things that first struck us a year and a half ago when we started working on this is what makes for great conversation? When do you feel that sense of flow, that sense of energy, and connection with another person? I think most of the time, it's when you feel heard and understood. You've received a little bit of affirmation, but it's not completely sycophantic, right? It doesn't just agree with you at every moment. It can be a little bit challenging. It has boundaries. You can push it on certain topics, and it'll take a position. That's really healthy. Also, it's just curious.\nI mean, I think many people are excited by the idea, especially the users that we have, of someone asking them lots of questions about the topic that they're interested in. We don't always have someone in our lives who is as knowledgeable and as passionate about our favorite topics as we might like. That's where Pi comes in because it's super knowledgeable and engaging.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt sounds like a competitor to ChatGPT. Is it a competitor to ChatGPT? How does that make sense if you're also an investor in OpenAI?\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nWell, so I think there's going to be a number of agents. I don't think there's going to be one agent to rule them all, a ring and Mordor.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIs ChatGPT going to rule most of us? I mean.\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nNo, I don't think so. I mean, it's partially like the same reason we talk to different people for different aspects of our lives. This person we talk to about our passion about snowboarding. This person we talk to about what's going on in the country. This person we talk to. We have a pantheon. Same thing, we'll have a pantheon of different kinds of AI.\nOne will go, you ask ChatGPT, how do you comfort a friend who's lost a treasured pet? It says, here are five possible ways you might do that. You ask Pi. It'll say, oh, that sounds like it's really hard for you and your friend. You know your friend. Well, what would count as being present there for your friend? It still has the IQ. It has the five reasons, but it goes through that style of going through it.\nI think these are different interaction experiences. The question is, which one do you want this minute? Which one do you want more in your life? That kind of thing. Part of the design of Pi is, how do we help you be the best you? That does not mean by being sycophantic, for example. That is the question of ask you questions about, well, what do you think about this? How do you go through it and help you navigate your life by being helpful in that way?\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSam Altman was just on stage talking, as he sometimes does, about the theoretical dangers of AGI and ChatGPT 9. I'm just curious if you guys think generally that's a discussion worth having, and where you each are on this spectrum of existential dangers from AI.\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nWell, let's start with the fact that one of the things that I think is dangerous about the existential discussion is it blinds us from some of the near things, which is AI is amplification intelligence, as per the Impromptu book. It amplifies human beings. We see a bunch of good things in human beings, AI tutors, AI doctors, a bunch of other things. There's also bad human beings. What to do about bad human beings with AI is also part of the portfolio mix of how you shape this technology. It's one of the reasons why Mustafa's book, The Coming Wave, I highly recommend. I will hand the next part of the answer over to you.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWait, let me frame it though, Mustafa. Sam's probably left the building by now.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou can say anything you want.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nFrankly, where do you kind of disagree with some of the alarmism notes that he has sounded?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nLook, I think it's easy to speculate around what a GPT-9 might look like. I mean, six more orders of magnitude of compute would be eye-watering. I'm absolutely with those concerns around existential risk. If you play that out, that is many, many years. It is unclear what actually happens at that scale.\nWhat's much more clear, and what a lot of the themes I explore in the new book, is that in the near term, we're about to empower many, many people, if not ultimately everybody, with access to the ability to amplify their existing power. This is not just a knowledge engine, but in time, it'll allow you to take actions. You'll be able to make recommendations, buy things, book things. That's going to get smaller and cheaper, and therefore proliferate far and wide.\nThat is going to cause a dramatic instability and potentially a threat to the nation-state because anyone who has an agenda or is trying to sort of push a political outcome is suddenly going to see the barrier to entry to that kind of scaled impact lowered. There's going to be a real question around how states kind of manage that distribution of power. I think there'll be a tendency to lunge towards slightly more authoritarian, more surveillance-based mechanisms to prevent that proliferation, which would both be bad for innovation, and obviously dystopian from a political governance perspective.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHang on, because Sam and I were talking backstage as well. He's much more confident that AI will lead us to a more equal world than an unequal world. Are you saying that there's a better chance of economic dislocation and social dislocation as a result of this technology?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nBoth are likely to be true, actually, which is a little bit surprising. If you look back over the last 50 years, the transistor, the last wave which enabled the personal computer, has clearly made us in many ways more equal. Whether you're a billionaire or you earn $20,000 a year, we all get access to the same cutting-edge hardware. The smartphone and the laptop is broadly at the cutting edge.\nEveryone else will catch up over the next five to 10 years. We're on the same trajectory with respect to access to intelligence. That is an unbelievable idea. Over the next decade, hundreds of millions of people, and then billions of people, will get access to the same expert doctor, the same expert educator, the same tool for scheduling, prioritizing, organizing your life.\nThat is going to be the most meritocratic moment in the history of our species, for sure. It is a question around how individuals, groups, and organizations use that power, right? Clearly, we all have conflicting agendas, priorities, and goals. That's basically where I think that we end up with significant disruption.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK, Reid, that's the glass half full. I mean, what is the potential threat to the millions of coders, of customer service representatives, the job dislocation, the people who are serving jobs whose functions can be easily replaced by AI?\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYour LinkedIn hat on.\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nThe closest metaphor that I've come to use to describe this moment is it's a steam engine of the mind. If you look at the former steam engine, current steam engine, although obviously majorly amplified, industrial revolution gave us superpower of muscles, superpower of transport, superpower of construction, all these things. Now we're going to have superpowers of the mind.\nNow, there's a whole bunch of very positive things that come out of that. I mean, all of the things we have of the increase in wealth that allows medicine, general education, everything else comes out of the industrial revolution. I think the same thing will be coming out of the steam engine of the mind. The transition is going to be difficult. The transition is going to be, OK, well, customer service jobs are going to change a whole lot.\nNow, engineers, I think, look, if you roughly kind of go through a company and you go, well, we 10x each function, you say, you 10x salespeople. Great. Still want to hire more salespeople, want to hire more sales. 10x marketing people. It's like, OK, maybe the marketing function will change some, so less order entry, more thinking about it. You're still in a business competitive ecosystem.\nYou don't want to stop marketing or not be doing it. When you get to customer service, you get more replacement. Here's part of the thing that I, part of the reason why I did the book Impromptu and I'm trying to orient people is like, OK, customer service people, there's going to be a transition. Well, AI can help with that.\nYou can build AIs that help figure out other kinds of work and jobs that can help you find them, that can help you learn them, that can help you do them. That's the thing that we as a society need to be doing. It's less like, how do we slow down AI, how do we shape it to help the broad swath of humanity in this transition? That's where I'm trying to get the dialogue and discussion to.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nMustafa, we were just talking to Sam about Google and whether or not it's still scary. He's like, yeah, they're still formidable. You quit DeepMind and Google AI. Obviously, a lot of people have left Google. Is there something wrong at Google or some sort of innovator's dilemma there that will prevent it from truly succeeding on Generative AI because it undermines its own business model?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nLook, fundamentally, AI stands in tension with Google's existing business model. It's very hard to eat yourself from within and adapt and respond to the coming wave. For a while, Google was just idling. I was there. On LaMDA, we had ChatGPT before ChatGPT. It was just like a remarkable feeling internally playing with this incredible tool and not really being able to get it out into products.\nIt took the launch of ChatGPT to kind of threaten Google and really shake everything up. Google's a very formidable organization full of super smart people. I'm sure they'll be just fine. I can understand why they're stuck because nobody wants a personal AI in your pocket that is actually funded by ads. You don't want a salesman in your pocket that is trying to persuade you to go and buy more or do X, Y, Z.\nYou need fiduciary alignment. Your AI has to be on your team. That means ultimately, you have to pay for it. If somebody else is paying for it, you have to ask yourself, what are they trying to persuade you of? Are they trying to influence you in some way? I think people are alive to that now. That's a real challenge for Google because it's very unclear how they're going to manage this transition.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWe asked Sam if Google scares him. Does OpenAI scare you? Mustafa first, then you.\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nNo. No, it definitely doesn't. I mean, actually, this morning, we've announced our new large language model called Inflection 1. We set out to build a model that was fast enough and more capable than every other model on the market for our compute class. We're very proud that a year on from our launch, we're now better than LLama, ChatGPT, PaLM 540, Chinchilla, all of the other models of our size.\nThat's super important because it powers Pi, and ultimately, it will be available as a conversational API. You can obviously play with it at pi.ai now. I think that demonstrates that with a team of 35 people, in a pretty short order, we're able to exceed the cutting edge and now build an absolute best-in-class AI, which is very exciting.\nObviously, we've also managed to do that because we've been able to gather a huge amount of capital, some great investors, and train. In fact, what we now have is the largest operational cluster in the world of H100s, NVIDIA's latest chip. That's a huge advantage.\nOK. One of the things, because I was listening to your conversation with Sam, and it's obviously an awkward question when you ask him, it's like, well, should we trust you? Because it's like, yes, trust me. It's like, well, that's weird because if someone says.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIf somebody said, no, you shouldn't.\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nYes.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI was like, what?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nIf someone says, yes, trust me, you're like, well, wait a minute. Look, the OpenAI people are really great people. I think it's governed by a 501(c)(3). There's frequently a bunch of FUD social media stuff that kind of obscures that. I spent a number of years on the board and in team. I still work with them and help them.\nThey are fully paying attention to every serious question. I mean, for example, Sam went and spent a month. It's crazy. You're doing a startup. He spent a month doing a world tour, talking to people, saying, look, I'm here. You can talk to me about your concerns. I want to make sure it's good for humanity. I don't just care about this kind of US, San Francisco tech scene. I care about what its impact on humanity is. I have come here to talk to you. That kind of like, I'm engaged in conversation. I care about this. This is the kind of reason, in addition to a 501(c)(3) emission structure and everything else. No, I'm delighted with it.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI don't see how he's getting any work done with all this public. I want to change gears quickly. We're going to throw some Twitter polls up on the screen today. We asked Twitter users where the greatest advancements in AI would come from. We'll see the results. I want to ask about, maybe Reid starting with you, the US-China policy of divestment. Can we reasonably hope that doing that will maybe prolong America's advantage in AI? Is it a smart strategy?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nI don't think divestment is a smart strategy. I think staying connected is better for both the US, China, and the world. I think competition is very good. I think the fact that there's various ways that we in the US and the West Coast have an AI lead, I think that's a great thing for the values, the ecosystem, the great world order that the US should be very proud of in the last 70 years. There's lots of things to be critical of too, of course. As a really peaceful time, trying to make it business and interconnections is a really good thing. I'm a very strong believer and proponent of that. I think divestment's not the end.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nMustafa, you write in the book that China has an explicit national strategy to be the AI leader by 2030. Do you agree with Reid that withdrawal, divestment is a smart strategy?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nI mean, China is already ahead of its own schedule. I mean, it's publishing significantly more papers on AI than we are collectively in the rest of the world. I do think that our export controls were effectively a declaration of economic war on China. They were very firm and very aggressive. I think it sets us out on a hyper-adversarial footing. They have a huge number of levers too, and we should expect them to use them against us pretty soon, unfortunately.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWe talked a lot about regulation with Sam. Obviously, President Biden was just in town here this week talking about AI. He met with the president, Sundar, and Satya in DC. What is the prospect for real government oversight that protects users, protects the economy, and our political process?\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nLook, I think the good news is that the administration is taking a very, let's learn how to be smart about this. Let's assemble a set of thoughtful people from industry. Yesterday, assembling thoughtful people from outside of industry, academia, other kinds of places where they're doing it, and let's learn about it. I think they have a number of good people tasked with this, so I'm optimistic in that.\nOn the other hand, of course, a little bit like your interview with Sam, regulatory things is something that's very easy to get wrong. You need to be cautious about how you do it. You want it to be having a net positive impact, not, for example, regulatory capture, not a bunch of other things. I think you have to be careful about how you do it.\nI think it's worth adding that this time last year, almost no world leaders were talking about AI. I mean, I don't think there has ever been a technology trajectory in history that has gone from zero recognition to almost universal recognition. That's a good thing. I think it's in part because we collectively in industry have been trying to advocate and say, like, this is really serious. We should pay attention and invite the conversation wherever it ends up with respect to regulating existential risk or more near-term threats.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. I think we have to leave it there, Mustafa, Reid. Thank you, guys, for joining us.\n\nMustafa Suleyman\n\nCO-Founder, Inflection AI\n\nGreat to see you guys.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThanks a lot. Great to see you. OK. I'd now like to welcome to the stage Adam Selipsky, the CEO of AWS. Good to see you, Adam.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nHi, how are you?\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt's been a while.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI first went to meet Adam at Tableau, his previous company, for my Amazon book. I came away thinking, boy, this guy's tough. He's still like an Amazonian at heart. Now here you are back at Amazon. Well, thanks for joining us.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nThanks for having me. It's great to be here.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt strikes me, this morning, we've talked about OpenAI, big investment from Microsoft running on Azure. We've talked about Google Bard, obviously, Inflection AI, Mustafa's company, also running on Azure. I guess my first question is, this generative AI surprise, this revolution, does it buttress AWS's cloud leadership position, or does it threaten it?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, I think if we there's no birthright here. If we do our job right, I think it should buttress our existing leadership position in the cloud. I mean, as you implied today, we are by far the most broadly adopted cloud in the world, with the broadest set of capabilities. I think that generative AI is both an incredibly explosive and transformative set of technologies in and of itself, and it's fully dependent on the cloud to be successful. If you look at the massive amount of compute that's required, never mind any other IT-related stuff, just the massive amount of compute required, that's going to happen really predominantly in the cloud. Companies are going to want to view generative AI as part of an entire data strategy and data platform.\nYou're going to want to do your generative AI where you've got your data. You're also going to want the same bulletproof enterprise security, privacy, that you expect from any other cloud service. Because so many customers, and certainly more than on any other cloud, have that data on AWS, use AWS for security and operational excellence, I think that they're going to justifiably demand that AWS have a full, powerful suite of generative AI services.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. Do you need a popular LLM or an exclusive partner running on AWS, as it does seem like Microsoft and Google have? I mean, I guess I'm asking, who's your horse in the race right now?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nRight. Well, I think with all due respect, I think that's the wrong question. It would be like in 1997, when the Internet's happening and everything's kind of going nuts around us, you and I sitting around saying, who's the Internet company going to be? It kind of seems like a silly question, right? By the way, the leading search company then was AltaVista, and I guarantee you my kids have never heard.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThat's great. I love it.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nOf AltaVista. It's not, OK, we're who's ahead? Which runner is ahead in the race after three steps? Because it's a 10K race. What everybody needs now is experimentation, choice, and democratization of generative AI. Just like AWS was founded to democratize IT, we aim to democratize generative AI. We're operating at all layers of the stack. We've had our own custom chip program for a decade now, way longer than anybody else. We have not one, but two families of chips custom designed for machine learning, Trainium for training and Inferentia for running inference. Those are for people who are going to build models, train models. Most of our customers will interact with Amazon Bedrock, which is a managed service for accessing, deploying, and managing models. Here's where the choice comes in.\nWe are going to have our own models, our own LLMs. Amazon models' LLMs have been running in production inside of Amazon for a long time now. Parts of our retail search are powered by LLMs. A lot of Alexa's voice responses are LLM powered. Right now, we're in the process of taking those LLMs, making them bigger, and externalizing them. Later this year, those will be exposed for everybody to use.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThat is a Titan Brick?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nExactly.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, let me ask you.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nThat's just one model, one set of models, I should say. We're also exposing Anthropic inside of Bedrock, Stability AI, AI21, and I think a lot of others over time. Because nobody knows. Anybody who knows which model is going to be the winner is asking the wrong question. People need to experiment. We want to provide that choice.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. Pretend you're talking to a customer now. Make the argument, why should they use Titan or one of these other LLMs you're exposing rather than GPT-4, which now does seem to have a significant leadership position?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nYeah. Well, I don't know which model they should use. It depends who they are, and it depends what their application is. Some of them probably will want to use GPT, and some of them will want to use Titan, and some of them will want to use Anthropic. I think it's preposterous to me to think that one model or one company is going to be the solution for every application and every company out there. We're already seeing this heterogeneity. We're seeing an explosion of interest in Bedrock and Amazon's generative AI capabilities. Just this morning, Omnicom, one of the largest advertising communications firms in the world, announced they're working with AWS using Bedrock, as well as our custom chips inside of our compute capacity, to do generative AI going forward.\nEarlier this week, BBVA, one of the largest financial services firms in the world, announced they're working with Amazon on generative AI with Bedrock. It's that choice, combined with the enterprise security and privacy, which I think are so fundamental.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI can humbly admit, as a journalist covering tech for way too long, that in the fall, I was surprised by not only the quality of ChatGPT, but the customer response to this new wave of technology. Were you surprised?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, I think that, I mean, folks working in this area in AI have known about large language models for a long time. Very few companies have more experience with AI than Amazon. I mean, 1998, personalization on the Amazon website, that was AI.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK, still.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nCalled AI. SageMaker, 2017, now used by over 100,000 AWS customers. Most machine learning in the cloud, any cloud, happens on SageMaker. We have a lot of experience. We have a lot of people working on LLMs. I think the whole world was surprised that when 3.5 came out, it was such a dramatic improvement in responses. Not perfect by any means, but a dramatic improvement in responses over 3.0. I think that was the surprise, not the overall arc. The good news for our customers is that we have deep, deep expertise in AI. We've been working on different forms of it for a long time and are now pouring enormous resources into the generative part of AI.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. I'll give this up after this, I promise. Would you concede that Amazon's playing a little bit from behind right now?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nNo, I really don't think so. I mean, again, it's the race analogy of, like, are we really going to have a conversation about three steps into a 10K race? Who's in what position? It's about the long-term. Amazon has always taken a much more long-term view of the world than almost any other company. I think the key is we're building at multiple layers of the stack because we understand that's what customers need.\nWe're also building applications on top of these models. We've released CodeWhisperer, which is a coding companion on top of the Amazon LLMs. You type in words, it gives you back code. In internal tests, kind of coding challenges, developers finish their tasks on average 57% faster than those not using CodeWhisperer.\nPlus, it's very secure, private, tells you what open source you're using and what licensing restrictions there might be on it, which not every other solution out there does. I think we're very confident. If you look at the thing which the only thing which ought to give us confidence is customer response. I mentioned Omnicom. I mentioned BBVA this week. Old Mutual, which is one of the largest financial services companies in Africa, is going all in on AWS and using us for generative AI. Really exciting developments to come.\nWe're talking to one company who has millions of lines of mainframe code. They're talking to us about moving over these really gnarly mainframe applications and millions of lines of code using generative AI from AWS. I think it's this consumer application, this chat application, which is so easy for folks to understand because they can say, give me a haiku about farm machinery. It does it.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThat's the key, the haikus.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWhat I think folks in this room and watching online understand is that there is a full suite of enterprise, company, and organizational applications. There's going to be huge needs there. We're going to be focused on customer service, coding, drug discovery, and wealth management, providing better solutions for customers and a full suite of applications across every industry. I think we're very well positioned there.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nDo you feel like you have or are close to having a GPT-4 quality model running on AWS?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nAll of the tests that we've done, as well as more and more customers who are in the existing current preview of Bedrock, have been very impressed with the quality of our models. Of course, again, it's not just about our models. We're going to be proud of our models, I predict. Anthropic does an amazing job, and they're right up there in quality with any model in the world.\nStability AI, big leader for models generating images. Collectively, I think these models will provide absolutely the best destination, all with a consistent API set, consistent AWS security, consistent identity system, all in a private, isolated, virtual private cloud. None of this, hey, here's an application, and now you have to have a bunch of Fortune 500 CIOs ban it from their companies, which is what's happened. From day one, it's always going to be AWS-class security.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. I want to put a slide up showing a Bloomberg Intelligence estimate on projected generative AI revenues over the next, I think it's maybe 10 or, yeah, 7 or 8 years.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nI've not seen it.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWho knows about the numbers that far out. It's up and to the right. I just can imagine a lot of financial types who are out there looking at Amazon's numbers and wondering how much of a sales tailwind this will be for AWS. What can you tell us about, you mentioned it's so computationally intensive, what you see the impact being for AWS?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, it's really early. I think prognostication is fun, and probably important at the end of the day. I think it's also important to be humble, to be nimble, anything ending in \"ill,\" and to understand that we're going to have to all adjust rapidly. That being said, I think that, well, look, I don't think any of the fundamentals about cloud computing have changed. Probably, who knows, call it 10% of IT has moved to the cloud. We're still very, very early. Whether you're talking about any application, there's still massive runway for things to move to the cloud, and we firmly believe that they will.\nOn top of that, I think that generative AI is going to be the next massive increase in workloads moving to the cloud or, in many cases, happening for the first time and happening in the cloud. I do think that it should be a significant tailwind for cloud providers, and particularly for AWS, given our leadership position. Obviously, we need to come out with the capabilities, the services that justify people using us for that purpose.\nI think if we do a good job of listening to customers, it should provide significant demand for years to come. I mean, the computational requirements are so intense. One thing which also, I think, works in favor of AWS is that a lot of people are asking about, hey, what about the energy consumption? What about sustainability?\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou run those efforts inside Amazon.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nYeah. I mean, I also run sustainability. It's kind of the other thing I do inside of Amazon. We, as a company, and I personally care a lot about sustainability. People say, well, is this generative AI, massive compute, is that incompatible?\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYeah. Are we going backwards?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nIs that sustainable? Well, no, we're not. Because number one, these workloads, there's no putting the genie back in the bottle. Generative AI is going to happen. Let's make it happen in a highly energy efficient and sustainable way. If you look at our custom chips that we design, if you take Graviton, for example, which is our oldest chip family, Graviton is 60% more energy efficient than equivalent x86-based compute capacity.\nIf you look at an enterprise just in general, never mind generative AI, just moving from their own data centers to the cloud to AWS, there was a study done showing that AWS is 3.6x more energy efficient than the average enterprise data center in the United States. We are the sustainable place.\nWe're doing it through a whole series of technological improvements, plus a commitment, which we're 85% of the way there already, to be 100% renewable energy by 2025, which is just around the corner.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nRight. You guys had another commitment called Shipment Zero, which was a net carbon zero commitment by 2030, which you guys, I guess, maybe scrapped or you took off the website. As a longtime Amazon watcher, my heart just kind of sank because you guys have been so prominent about these goals. I guess the question is, like, have these commitments become harder to meet than they were to make?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, I think your heart should be sinking at the state of global warming.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, it certainly is.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS",
    "content4": "Mine is. We should all be concerned about that. I think your heart should be singing at the leadership position that Amazon is trying to establish, and at the improvements we're trying to make, and at the very public goals we've set.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhy did you remove that particular commitment?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, because it subsumed, really, in a much broader, bolder commitment, we made a very public pledge to be net zero carbon across all of Amazon, not just AWS, all of Amazon by 2040, which is 10 years ahead of the Paris Accords. Now, for a technology company like AWS, I won't say it's easy, but it's doable. You'll hear that from other tech companies.\nFor a big retailer with air freight, inbound transportation, stores, and packaging, it's actually really, really hard. We will be the first to say, we don't know how we're going to get there in all dimensions. I can tell you how we're going to get there in renewable energy. I can't tell you how we're going to get there in all elements of transportation, packaging, and buildings. We're an innovative company, and we take bold, long-term bets.\nWe made this pledge publicly, not privately, in order to, number one, have a forcing function for ourselves because it's not easy, and also because we want to inspire other organizations, governments, and companies to join us. We have over 400 signatories now of the climate pledge, that's growing every month. It's not a competition against other organizations, it's a competition against the thermometer.\nFrankly, I want other people to out-innovate us. I want to be beaten, if you will, in the race to become sustainable. Hopefully, we can be inspired by things that other people are doing. Of course, we adjust our goals over time, but the thing I would focus on is this audacious goal to be net zero carbon by 2040.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThat's a line in the sand. I mean, even as things like generative AI take more and more computational resources, even as you get more efficient with compute, that's a commitment that you can hold firm on, even if you don't know how you're going to get there?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWe have made a public pledge. We intend on getting there. There are lots of other areas of progress we're making in the interim. For example, if you take packaging for the retail business, the average packaging per shipment has decreased by 38% since 2015, which is another example of it can be sustainable and good for our business. It's lower cost for us, and it's much more sustainable for the planet. Any time you create a win-win like that, it just works for everybody and becomes a really sustainable business proposition.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nLet's get back to AI. Let me ask you about Alexa. I know it's slightly out of your purview, but Alexa runs in your servers. Can Alexa be a generative AI play? Should it be?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nAlexa is already, as I mentioned, already powered in large part by LLMs that Amazon built and have been in production for a while now. I think that she's only going to get smarter, better, and more personalized as the LLM technology expands and improves.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt feels to me, as a longtime user, and my wife, who's here, knows, I populated her house with them at one point. Today, it feels, as does Siri, frankly, a step behind. Would you agree with that?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nNo, I think that Alexa, well, I use Alexa in my house. I mean, I guess we all have different strokes for different folks. We love Alexa, and I like to think she loves us. Although if you ask her that, she won't actually tell you yet. I think Alexa's been getting better and better, more skills, better skills, more understanding of you, your likes and dislikes, and your habits. I think that the rapid improvements that we're making in generative AI are truly going to continue to transform\nAlexa into a truly personalized assistant. We do want Alexa to be an absolutely indispensable, best-in-the-world personal assistant to you. I think that we've got a lot of work to do. I'll leave it to the Alexa folks to fill in all of those blanks over time. We're actually very confident in that plan and very optimistic about Alexa being able to fulfill that role in people's lives that I think they're really going to love.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI want to get to two more in the two minutes we have left. Your boss and predecessor, Andy Jassy, has been kind of cutting some of the big bets at Amazon. One that he hasn't cut is the satellite plan, Kuiper. I just wonder what you see as the opportunity considering a rival system, Starlink, from Tesla. It does seem to be operational and quite far ahead.\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, we're very optimistic about Kuiper. There's huge interest from governments, enterprises, and lots of other organizations. Billions of people around the world are underserved for internet, and Kuiper really aims to democratize that. There's a theme here to democratize that and provide great internet service to so many billions of underserved people. In addition, whether it's automobile companies, telecommunications companies, or lots of other enterprises who are AWS customers, governments, they want, especially from remote locations, to be able to backhaul information up to Kuiper, back into the AWS cloud. I think as we launch our first satellites.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhich one?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nComing later this year, really ramping up in 2024 and 2025, is my understanding. Being in service in that time frame initially and being able to deliver that for AWS customers is huge. Before we go, I do just want to remind folks that just today, this morning, AWS has launched its $100 million Generative AI Innovation Center, where we're going to be going out to all those customers around the world, enterprises with expertise, free AWS expertise, solutions, architects, engineers, strategists, and working with them one-on-one to envision, design, and then actually deliver generative AI capabilities, not talk, but actual applications.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThat's discounts for new companies, or?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nYeah. We're just going to bring our internal AWS experts free of charge to a whole bunch of AWS customers, focusing on folks with significant AWS presence, and go help them turbocharge their efforts to get real with generative AI, get beyond the talk.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right. Last one in -10 seconds. I guess it's got to be a quick one. You and Andy are both in the same situation. You're the guy after the guy, the founder whose name was synonymous with the early stage of legendary growth. What do you want Adam's AWS legacy to be?\n\nAdam Selipsky\n\nCEO, AWS\n\nWell, I don't really think of it in personal terms, to be honest with you. I don't have a canned answer. I will say that I would love it if I could be known to really help drive a business that is constantly, no matter how big it gets, no matter how far-flung it gets, puts customers at the very center of what we're doing, always puts customers' interests before anybody else's interests, yet at the same time is an empathetic, equitable, fun, and innovative place for employees to work.\n\nBrad Stone\n\nEditor of Businessweek, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAll right. Adam Selipsky, thank you for joining us.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nPlease welcome to the stage Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon with Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOh, that's more like it. Good morning, everybody. You joined Qualcomm as an engineer in 1995. I bring that up for two reasons. One, it was your birthday yesterday. Belatedly happy birthday.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI won't date you. You've also seen the arc of technological development. We know Qualcomm is this, well, as the largest maker of smartphone processors, the brains inside the handsets that are all pointing at you right now taking photos. The question, is Qualcomm an AI company?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, this is a great question to ask. It's incredible to see all of the development you see right now on AI. Here's how I answer that question. Actually, it's very simple. If you think about AI, when you think about semiconductors, really accelerating computing, you do a lot of computation. What we see, what you can do with those large language models, large models for images and video. If you think about the history of computing, computing starts in the cloud, and it gets scale at the edge. I think that's what happens with CPUs. That's what happens with all other forms of computing. I think the smartphone is a great example of that. If you look, the largest computing platform ever developed is the smartphone right now. It's the largest development platform for mankind.\nWhat is good about the smartphone, it's a device that is with you all the time. If AI becomes pervasive, which we believe it will become pervasive, especially when you look at how those large models, they are very natural, how you can converse with them, they have contextual information, and all of those things, that's going to happen at the edge. That's how you should think about Qualcomm. If AI is going to get scale, you're going to see it running on Qualcomm Snapdragon devices, whether it's in your phone, in your car, in your PC, and into other machines. I think that's a great opportunity for us.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIf the future is to democratize access to artificial intelligence tools, generative AI tools, and Qualcomm's going to make that happen, why are you not getting like Jensen Huang-level love, Cristiano?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, I think what's happening right now, and by the way, it's great for the semiconductor industry, for anybody that has been on the forefront of computing. Qualcomm probably used to be well-known as a communication company. Actually, if you look at what we do right now, it's more of a connected processor company than communication. As those models started to become very popular, they're going to be running at the edge. I expect that AI becomes an option on Qualcomm right now. Look, I'll give you an example. I saw something that Ada\nm said, I think, in the prior conversation when he said something about in 1997, you could try to guess who are the winners and losers on the internet. It would be probably a very wild guess. I think what we see today is this generative AI opportunity is huge.\nWe don't know yet all of the different applications that are going to come up. We're seeing that just within the past six months is a revolution in the number of companies coming with use cases. Those use cases are going to happen on devices. I think that's going to be a great opportunity for.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHold that thought. What we're going to do now, I'm going to show you something to the audience here and those with us virtually. During that, think about questions for Cristiano based on what you see. With that, let's bring up the video. Cristiano, when it comes up and plays, explain to us a little bit what it is that we're seeing. Here at the Bloomberg Technology Summit, we're going to nail the technology any second. Just wait. The video's going to come. When it does, it will have been worth the wait. Here we go.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYes. What you basically see is a control net demo. You have an input image on your phone. You tell in your input prompt what you want the image to be. You want it to make it a masterpiece, look like Venice, canals, 4K. It just runs and gives you this very unique image, image to image that's never been created before, created through AI running on your phone.\nI think it's a good time to talk a little bit about how we think about AI at the edge, outside the data center. Like we have seen everywhere, there's going to be this huge opportunity for the cloud, but it's going to be this huge opportunity for devices. What you do on the device is very different. There are a number of reasons why this is going to be very popular on the device.\nFirst, the device has contextual information about you and has real-time information, like a picture you just took. You want it right now, at that moment, change that picture and share it with somebody else with your messaging platform.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nFor context, that video, that device was run in airplane mode without any external connection, right? It ran the model locally on device.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nAbsolutely. That's one of the reasons. You have real-time contextual information. There's another reason. Processing on the phone is virtually free. When you think about you running those models in the cloud and think about a large language model for every token, like a word as the sentence, if you do that, if you have experiment that, you see the words coming up.\nFor every token, you're running the entire model, and you use a lot of cloud computing. The computing that is in the palm of your hand, in the dashboard of your car, in your computer, that processing power is available and is dedicated to you. That's another reason you're going to run those on the devices. The number three reason is you can see this, and there's a lot of academia work. Those models, when they get very well trained, they become smaller.\nOne of the things we have done that's very unique to Qualcomm, we spent a decade on this. I think we invested in this before it was popular. It's kind of the history of many of the things that Qualcomm has done on research. What we did is could we come up with ability to do very high process, high performance, accelerated computing on the device running large number of parameters.\nYou can do it, for example, in a phone without compromising battery life, because you're going to never trade the form factor and the battery life. You expect it to do all this computation and still last all day. We developed some very unique technology, which is the most efficient accelerated computing from a performance per watt, and we're bringing that to all of our devices, just to give an order of magnitude.\nThe new Snapdragon processor we're going to launch this year for flagships that come to the market in 2024 is going to support in excess of 10 billion parameter models running locally on the device. What we're going to do in Windows on ARM platform, it's going to be over 20 billion parameters. What we're going to do in cars is going to be in the order of 40 to 60 billion parameters running on the device.\nWhen you think about it, when you see all of those models being well trained and become smaller, we're going to see the development of what we call hybrid AI. You would do a query, like you just did this query. You had this picture. You wanted to do this. If the model's very well trained, it'll run on a device, and it's going to cost nothing to the cloud.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, I think the question that the audience will have, and I have, is, say, shipping in 2024, but how real is this? The demonstration showed you running a 1.5 billion parameter model. When can we do that? It's real.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nOh, it's more real than you think. For example, Stable Diffusion, which is text to image, this summer, we're getting to sub 5 seconds with no cloud connectivity. In our Snapdragon Summit, we're going to show 10 billion parameters running. You'll be able to buy, for example, if you want to buy a Galaxy S24 that launches next year, you're going to have that computing power.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThere are lots of engineers I speak to. You are yourself an engineer. They do express skepticism that this is going to happen, that all of us will be running large language models or generative AI tools locally on device without connection with billions of parameters, because they doubt the processor power or they doubt the work that you can do at Qualcomm on the algorithms. Where did you do the innovation?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nOK, this is a good question. That's why I was about to tell you about how we think about hybrid AI. It's actually like your phone works today. You have a lot of applications in your phone. You go to the App Store, you have a lot of apps. The apps are being processed on the device, and they're being processed in the cloud. They work as a single computing. Hybrid AI is what's happening right now, it is really that.\nYou have a model running locally. You provide a query to the model. The model will decide if it runs locally, or you give a cloud a head start in sending tokens to the cloud. It's going to be completely transparent to you. In some applications, it's not just because you don't want to use the cloud.\nYou want the fast response on the device because of latency or contextual information. Here's how I like to explain this. When the smartphone happened, I think most people don't remember this. I'm sure I'm going to show my age. I've been in every transition of technology at Qualcomm. We were the first company that came up with the concept. At the time, we got a Palm OS, a Palm Pilot, connected with cellular, and created the very first smartphone in the world. This was the time of the feature phones. You use your phone to make calls and text. That's what you use your phone for. GPS was just for E911. That's the only application.\nAll of a sudden, this became a computer. People say, what am I going to do with it? I like to put this example.I remember when we talk about 4G broadband, there was a lot of analysts with their BlackBerrys telling us, who wants this? What are you going to do with this? I have everything I need in my BlackBerry. It was an incredible device.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWell, we should acknowledge or pull one out. BlackBerry is not really a thing anymore, is it?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nWell, what it shows is the revolution that happened with all of those applications on your phone. That's how you should think about AI. We're just at the very beginning. We're just showing some examples, Stable Diffusion, ControlNet. We're going to have some simple photos. There are going to be so many different applications. Think about a car, for example. I like this example because as a kid, I used to watch Knight Rider, kids. Think about natural language conversation. It's perfect for a car.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhy is Qualcomm relevant to that discussion?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nWell, just look at what we're doing right now. I think I probably don't have to tell you about our position in the mobile market. I think especially on premium computing for the Android space. We're now virtually working with virtually every brand in automotive for next generation digital cockpit. We've been working with Microsoft for the transition of next generation PCs using our silicon. We have been the partner of choice of companies like Meta, Microsoft, announced with Google, and Samsung for augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality devices. We've been expanding to industry and other things.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nLet's hit pause for a second because I know that you're a busy man, and you're operating in a lot of fields. Go back to that video and this audience question. Why would I want to locally process a complex model on a small device when those models would run better in the cloud? I guess that applies to the automotive example as well.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYes. Instead, I provided the answers to those questions in the phone. I'm going to change the conversation a bit and talk about it in the car. When you are inside the car, right? For example, we have a lot of AI in the car today for assisted driving and autonomy. Just to give an example, if you look at GM, Super Cruise, Ultra Cruise, all running on a Qualcomm AI processor.\nWe have a lot of AI processing in the car. The car needs to make decisions that are very context related in real time. For example, when you think about an ADAS system, assisted driving, the sensors in the car for assisted driving autonomy see an image. You need to make a decision. That computation needs to happen locally.\nThe reason Qualcomm became successful and expanding in ADAS is because you cannot put a server in the trunk of a car, especially in an EV, take away from the range. Now that computing power, you can use for a large language model. In the car, this model can be as big as the model in the cloud, and you have now the real context information. Let's say you're talking in the car of the future.\nYou're talking to the model like you would in Knight Rider, kids. You give a very complex instruction for the car. I want to go home. On the way home, I want to stop here. I want to order this. I want to pick it up. Those things are going to be very related to the information you have. It doesn't mean that you're separating the AI from the car, from the cloud. They're all combined. Everything that is contextual rich for that moment, the AI in the car is going to make a huge difference.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIn other words, days, weeks, months, probably years, when does it happen?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, it's very difficult to make a prediction. It's the same, try to make a prediction.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nBut broadly.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, I'm an optimist. I think we're going to start to see next year, in 2024, for phone applications, a lot richer. Thank you. We're going to see a lot richer ability to use AI for photography, like this example we just gave. How people share information, whether it's on WhatsApp or Google Messages, how they're going to share photos, how they're going to create content, you're going to see that next year.\nI think you're going to see a lot of productivity next year. We talk with Microsoft. We had incredible demos at Microsoft Build showing the copilot of all the Microsoft applications running on our AI engine in our future SoC that has our custom CPU that's going to the Windows devices in 2024.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOn device with no connection.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nIn 2024. See, this is another interesting thing. Enterprise applications. When the ChatGPT thing happened, it was an incredible thing. I immediately had within the internal memo say, our engineers can't get our source code and just send it to ChatGPT to verify this code because that's going to go into the wilderness, right? Enterprises really want for certain applications to run the data locally.\nMicrosoft has an incredible technology that you can provide a data set. It could be an Excel spreadsheet, and you apply the model on that spreadsheet. That's a great example of why you want to run those things locally. Some enterprises may not want to send the data to the cloud. That's how the enterprise works.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI know you. I knew that you would be fired up about this. I've only got 30 seconds left. Let's do this. How's doing business with Beijing at the moment?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, we have a great partnership with our customers in China. I think Qualcomm is probably one of the few examples of a very successful partnership and business with China. All of our customers in China pay intellectual property on cellular essential patents. We're all licensed, they pay. We have a vibrant business in the phone space with companies like Xiaomi, Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo, and Honor, et cetera.\nAs China builds an incredible industry for EV, they're all using Qualcomm chipsets. We're growing in industrial. Here's how I see it. If you are a leader on a particular technology, you will have a big business in China. It's just the nature of the size of the GDP, and that's what we see happening with Qualcomm right now.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nVery quickly, your Brad and Emily will be very angry at me. Does AI complicate that relationship with China?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nNo. Look, if you think about what's happening in phones, PCs, cars, everything at the edge, it's one of those things that it's very difficult to make predictions in politics. To this date, we have been able to continue to support development on on-device AI. I think across all of the different industries in China, there's some very interesting development, especially from the phone industry, how they're using this to create content or support creators.\n\nEd Ludlow\n\nCO-Anchor, Bloomberg Technology\n\nCristiano Amon, Qualcomm CEO, making the case basically for the future of AI being on what you're all pointing at me right now, the smartphones. Thank you very much.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you. Thank you. Pleasure to be here.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nPlease welcome to the stage Adobe Generative AI and Sensei VP Alexandru Costin, Creative Artists Agency Chief Legal Officer Hillary Crane, and Bloomberg's Rachel Metz.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHello. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning to you guys. Thank you both so much for being here. We've got a lot to talk about. AI and artists, and there's just so much happening there. AI has long been used by artists. It's gotten easier, cheaper, and more widespread with systems like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, ChatGPT, Adobe's Firefly, which I know you've been working on, and so on. What are some of the most interesting uses that the two of you are seeing for generative AI in creating art?\n\nHilary Krane\n\nChief Legal Officer, Creative Artists Agency\n\nWell, I think there's tons of examples. AI, like many things before, is just a new tool for the creative community. The creative community is very adept at taking on new tools and applying human creativity to get new art forms. One interesting thing we've seen in just the past couple of weeks is there's going to be a release of a new Beatles song.\nThere was a tape of John Lennon's voice where the quality was very poor. He and his family said, no, we can't make a song out of it. AI has now been able to clean that up, to make it of high enough quality that Paul McCartney, with the consent of the family, is going to release the first new Beatles song in decades. They released others in 1995, but the technology wasn't good enough for this one.\nThat's a fantastic application of the tool. We also see it being used in post-production in order to make a lot of things easier that were harder before. You can do a lot of things without the presence of the talent by using scans. That's going to be another fantastic application. The sky's the limit. I think we're only beginning to scratch the surface on where the creativity will lead us. Alexandru, what kinds of things are you seeing?\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nSame in our world. When we look at the spectrum of art and creativity in general, starting from fine arts to consumer content creation, the two biggest uses we've seen recently, we launched generative fill in Photoshop for photo retouching. This took off like one of our most successful betas. A lot of actual production workflows and content creation workflows for professionals are being helped by generative AI in new ways.\nWe're also enabling some of that technology for consumers and communicators that don't have the skills to actually create. We're seeing an actual explosion of creativity at that consumer side. Folks that have ideas that in the past they weren't able to express themselves, now with the help of generative AI directly integrated in our workflows, they're able to create content and have a differentiated social presence, or just communicate with their families, et cetera.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAlexandru, you also have a lot of people that are using Firefly that are, as you mentioned, are doing work-related projects with it. What are some things that people are doing with it that you might not have expected?\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nWe're still in beta. Our general availability release is happening very soon. Everybody's still experimenting on the Firefly website. We've seen a lot of viral activity with people extending out Beatles album covers, for example. This was something we didn't expect to be as popular and viral, or mixing memes together. This is like really, really crazy stuff. Again, this is just human creativity at its best when they come up with new ideas. Technology just enables this new wave of creativity.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat are some of the concerns that the two of you have about the use of generative AI in the art world, like ethical concerns, particularly around how data is collected to train systems that can generate textual images? This stuff is typically collected from all over the internet. Increasingly, some people, such as artists in particular whose work may have been sort of hoovered up as part of a data set, are upset about that.\n\nHilary Krane\n\nChief Legal Officer, Creative Artists Agency\n\nYeah. Well, I think you're seeing, I mean, we've already seen the lawsuits. I think Getty Images is the best one. People challenging the practice of on what material you train the machines and the ethics behind what's used to train the machines. There is a difference between publicly available and legally available for your use to make money. The whole intellectual property regime gives rights to certain individual creators and people who appear.\nWhen a machine is trained for a commercial purpose using those rights without their permission, I think you're at serious risk. I think if we think about an actor and how important the creative decisions are that they make, not just when they're doing a role, but as to what roles they agree to do in order to create their whole body of work, that's a real curatorial expression of self.\nIf other people can take that away from them by using their image and without their consent, using either their prior creative thoughts in the form of a writer or their image or their voice for a musician in order to make a product that they're unaware of or haven't consented to be in, I think we're in very murky or even not that murky, pretty black and white ethical land where we have to think about how do we create the rules and the norms around use of these creative individuals' work in a way that respects their rights and doesn't do violence.\nWe heard a lot of talk this morning about threatening of humanity. Obviously, human extinction is kind of an important big deal. I get it. Along the way, we shouldn't only think about human extinction. We should think about mapping basic ethics and norms onto this fantastically creative and powerful tool.\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nThis was top of mind for us too when we designed Firefly because artists were indeed up in arms about the fact that their public content was used without their consent, compensation, or control. When we designed Firefly, we actually decided to train only on data we had in Adobe Stock and publicly available data with copyrights expired. On purpose, we do not include any recognizable characters.\nWe do not include any IP trademarks. By the nature of the training data, not only are we respectful with our customers because these artists are basically all of them our customers, but we are also enabling enterprises and creators of content, generative content, to be comfortable using this content because the risk of generating by mistake or somebody else's IP or recognizable character is zero.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nAlexandru, I have a question for you related to that because Adobe recently said that business users of Firefly can get an IP indemnity from Adobe, which essentially, as I understand it, means that if a business customer is sued over some media that it makes with Firefly, let's say an ad hypothetically, Adobe will pick up the legal tab, right?\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nThat's basically, then again, our comfort comes from the fact that we train on data we control. That's curated both using AI, but more importantly, it's curated using human curators. We make sure we don't leak any IP in it. This is why we have this comfort for our enterprise customers and for cases where they actually, it's just for the generated content. If they remix it with potentially infringing content, in that case, the IP indemnity doesn't apply. For pure content generated by Firefly, we are offering this IP indemnity to enterprise customers.\n\nHilary Krane\n\nChief Legal Officer, Creative Artists Agency\n\nYeah. I think it's fantastically interesting and pioneering work. The idea of ethical training, I hope, becomes part of the greater lexicon. That's what's happening here. It's important for the corporate and business clients who have that indemnity. We were also talking about the democratization of creativity and allowing somebody like me who lacks it to have the tools to perhaps create things.\nI don't want to be stealing somebody else's work as I'm exploring my creativity for the first time. Having tools and mechanisms that would give me or every other creator the confidence that when they're diving into this world for the first time, they're not doing it in a way that's doing violence to other creative people who've invested their lifetime in the work, I think is super important. I really commend Adobe for what they've done.\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nThank you.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI'm curious though, what did Adobe's lawyers think of that? Hillary, as a lawyer yourself, maybe you've got some thoughts on that.\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nI mean, Dana Ro, our Chief Legal Officer, would be a better person to answer this. They're fully behind this. For a long time, actually, we've been pioneering many other innovative things in the context of generative content, like the Content Authenticity Initiative that I want to touch upon later on. We do have, again, our legal department of full support because they know how we train. They're deeply involved.\nOur legal department runs what's called our AI ethics program. We have a program we've set up many years ago in 2020 when we started pioneering generative AI using GANs, which is a different type of model with neural filters in Photoshop. We had our legal department full engagement. We've created this ethics department that helped us navigate all of those, not only training data issues, but also bias and harm reduction initiatives, et cetera. We do have a long history of investing thoughtfully in this space.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. Hillary, I have a question for you specifically about some stuff that's going on right now in Hollywood. Earlier this month, the biggest union in Hollywood, the SAG-AFTRA Actors Union, began negotiating with studios regarding a new three-year contract. One of the issues they're discussing is the use of AI to do things like mimic users' voices or their bodies. I'm curious how you envision generative AI changing Hollywood, and who stands to benefit, and who stands to get hurt from this.\n\nHilary Krane\n\nChief Legal Officer, Creative Artists Agency\n\nWell, I think that's a question that remains unanswered. I'm not myself involved in the guild conversations. I hasten to point out it's not only the Screen Actors Guild. The Directors Guild reached an agreement with the studios on AI, and the Writers Guild is also in the mix. I think we're going to have to wait to see what all of those negotiations yield. In the end, I'll go back to where I started.\nAs a tool for creativity, I think we're going to see an explosion of content in Hollywood that could be good for Hollywood, but only if we pay attention to establishing the ethical norms and creating a world in which, before the law or legislation can catch up, the genie is let out of the bottle because it is normalized to steal the content that's available but not legally available for use. I think we're in a little bit of a time race to get to the ethical standards to make sure that this tool in the end delivers on the creative promise of it, both for the amateur, but all the way up through the chain of Hollywood.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOne more thing I wanted to ask you about related to actors and contracts and stuff. I'm curious if you're seeing the applications of generative AI being discussed or put into film contracts. If so, how? What kind of questions does this bring up for artists protecting their images?\n\nHilary Krane\n\nChief Legal Officer, Creative Artists Agency\n\nWell, generative AI is new. The idea of special effects is not new, and the ability to manipulate images to change them post-production has existed for a long period of time. We have some precedent here, and it is pretty well established that the studios seek consent from the artist before they will fundamentally change their performance. I'm going to forget the actor, but there was an example two decades ago where they added a tear to an actor's performance that he didn't approve of.\nWhen he saw the film and he had a tear, he was like, how'd that happen? This conversation started that long ago, and it's continuing. There is a question of who owns the character, who owns the digital image of the actor who creates the character?\nWhat control should that actor have over use of those tools in the future, both in respect to the piece of art that they've agreed to make, and with respect to other pieces of art? I think ultimately we're going to get to a comfortable place with the studios because the studios and artists are in a symbiotic relationship. More concerning is those who are not part of the mainstream but who want to jump in by creating work. They now have the ability to create at much lower cost because of the availability of machines that have potentially been trained on the pilfered content. That's a real problem.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nLet's talk a little bit about audience awareness. This is something I think about whenever I see a trailer that might use AI in a certain way. I have seen some commercials that are using AI. When should the audience be made aware of when AI is part of the creative process? Why and why not? Alexandru, I know Firefly does some embedded details to mark AI-generated images, but I'm not sure how that translates to a final product.\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nYeah. For a long time, as we were pioneering those generative work, we were receiving this media attention and industry feedback that we need to invest in content authenticity. We need to basically help content consumers understand whether a piece of content was digitally edited and, in this case, more recently, fully generated synthetically.\nFour years ago, our Legal Department and Dana Row pioneered the creation of the Content Authenticity Initiative, which is a consortium that has 1,000 members now, starting from camera manufacturers like Qualcomm and others, and ending up with websites and content consumption places. Across the stack, we're encouraging the implementation of a digital nutrition label, which we call content credentials, that is a piece of information that describes what modifications were brought to that content, and that's embedded cryptographically in the content itself.\nThat means that somebody consuming a piece of content with content credentials embedded should be able to read the nutrition label. They should be able to understand, is this piece of content real or is it generated or edited so it does not represent the original intent? This is extremely important in this age where it is so easy to create this content. Imagine the implications of deepfakes in politics.\nI mean, this is a really serious issue. This is why we are encouraging a lot of our partners we have. We are working with generative companies like Stability AI, Spawning AI, and others to standardize on these content credentials initiatives, content authenticity initiatives, so consumers of content have the option to first verify, and then trust, a piece of content. Today, you see a photo. It looks real. You implicitly believe it immediately.\nIn reality, in this new future where all content will be modified digitally and/or generated fully, we need to enable content to embed this authenticity information so consumers can have the right of understanding, then verifying, and then trusting that piece of information.\n\nHilary Krane\n\nChief Legal Officer, Creative Artists Agency\n\nI agree with all of that. I believe that some form of watermarking or otherwise being able to trace the provenance of a piece of art back to the consent of the artists who are included should be a part of this kind of nutrition label. The reason I go for a watermark is because it's not just as you're watching the whole content. As we know, somebody can take a clip of that that may or may not have the nutrition label, put it on a platform, and it can be around the world before the artist even knows it's happened to them. If we can embed something that'll pop, that'll show not OK or OK, that's part of the solution. Are we there yet technologically? I don't think so.\nWith the smart guys sitting next to me working on it and others, and if we take them at their word, the leaders we heard from this couch this morning, I think that we can do a lot to create these tools that'll make it a much safer environment.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThank you both so much for talking to me about this. It was wonderful to have you here. Thank you. Let's give them a round of applause. Thank you so much. You guys can just walk off that way. Thank you. It was so nice to see you in person. Thank you. Now I'd like to welcome to the stage Emad Mostaq, CEO and Founder of Stability AI. Emad, thank you so much for joining me. We've got a lot to talk about.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYes.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nHas it been exactly 10 months since Stability AI released Stable Diffusion publicly?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah, we released it with Confucius on the Runway 10 months ago. It doesn't feel like it. It feels like 10 years.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. What has changed since then? Because a lot has changed.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nI think that when we kind of released it, it was building on the research of many others and kind of this whole ecosystem. It was the first large-scale usable model on someone's laptop. That's why you saw such a massive take-up of it. It overtook Bitcoin and Ethereum in three months. It took them 10 years and developer interest on GitHub. Now, cumulatively, the whole ecosystem's overtaking Linux. As you saw ChatGPT and others come, you now have where we are now, which is this technology everywhere and everyone talking about it.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nLet's talk about the new model that's out today. Tell us about SDXL 0.9 and what it means for Stability AI. If we could see some of those images, that would be awesome.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah. I think there's continuous evolution. Three of the five Stable Diffusion authors, including the two leads, we're lucky they work at Stability, plus again this whole ecosystem, that took an open model and they just improved it iteratively. SDXL, we kind of scaled it up and introduced some new architectures. It can now do hands.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nLook at that one.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nThat was always a thing because hands are kind of weird. I mean, can an AI do hands? No, can you? It's kind of difficult. Perfect hands, perfect text, photorealistic images now, but also with some mitigations built in because, again, that's why it was important to put it out into the open so everyone could both improve it, and then attack it so it becomes more robust.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou said mitigations?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYes.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat does that mean exactly?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYou have things like we had photorealistic models earlier this year that we didn't release because the time wasn't quite right for it, because you had to build in things like invisible watermarking, working with Adobe on content, authenticity.org, and many others as well, because the technology's inevitable, because you see it emerging everywhere. Part of what we want to do at Stability is introduce standards around that so you can track it, so you can use it, and use it appropriately.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nRight now, if I were to use the latest model, let's say I generated this picture or something similar to it since it's available as of today, would it have some sort of embedded watermarking?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYes. We can't really recall full details about that. There are some official ones, some unofficial ones, because these models become the default that people use. You want to have some way of telling what is generated versus what is not, and that's a huge research area.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nExcuse me. A persistent issue with all kinds of AI image generators, including Stable Diffusion, is bias in the images that are generated. As we know, that stems in large part from the training data. How is Stability AI addressing bias in its Stable Diffusion models? How do you improve this over time?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah. I think there was a great research report done by your colleagues, kind of where they looked at the original Stable Diffusion. That was its academic release and the inherent biases because it was taken of a picture of the available internet, and then it reflects the biases of that internet, which is very Caucasian, Western, and others. Part of our mission at Stability is to build a foundation to activate humanity's potential. We are working with multiple governments already on national data sets that reflect the culture of those countries. For example, one of our team members, Makoto Shing, did Japan's Stable Diffusion, where they swapped out the language version because if you typed in salary man to the original Stable Diffusion, it was a very happy man with lots of money.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOh, OK.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nThe Japanese version is a very sad person.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYes.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nI think this is the future. Every single country, this is vital infrastructure. They need their own data sets, they need to have their own models, and they need to be able to interact and reflect those contexts and address these biases. We can't do that with black boxes. There's no way to have one model to rule them all that reflects everyone's context.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou're working right now on different data sets for different countries?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah. You take national broadcaster data, you take education data, you take cultural data, and you build from there. I think from a safety perspective, we can't train on the whole internet anymore. The internet's full of garbage. That's one of the reasons we offer opt-outs of data sets, and we have massive investments in refining data sets because we should move to having that as a common infrastructure, both for the proprietary models of the OpenAIs and Anthropics and the others of the world, and also for the open models. You are what you eat, and right now, the models feed buffeted bias garbage. No wonder they turn out a bit weird. Let's feed them better stuff so we have nice free-range organic models.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIf I'm a country and I'm building a data set that I want to be used for a model, who owns that data set then? Is that belonging to the country? Who is in charge of that?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI",
    "content5": "I believe it should be national infrastructure. In the UK, we have HDR UK, which organized the national biology and data information infrastructure with federated learning and others. I think this will be infrastructure for every country, so every country has the data sets. We have public broadcasting data that should be used to power AI models.\nThat will lead to the innovation that we also require to deal with what's coming, because this technology is going everywhere. It's not enterprise-ready. Next year, that kicks off. The only thing that I think that can solve the disruption here is innovation. It becomes vital for countries to stoke that innovation through open data, open models, and innovation enhancement.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI'm going to ask you a little bit about finance. Last year, Stability raised $101 million at a valuation of $1 billion. We understand you're trying to raise more. Can you talk about how much you're trying to raise?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nWell, we're not trying to raise more, but we have constant interest. Yesterday, I received eight incoming investor interest notes because we're a bit different. Our total addressable market is all the private data in the world and turning it intelligent, whereas everyone else is looking at proprietary models, which I believe is a race to zero.\nThrough amazing partnerships like with AWS and more to be announced, our models will be available anywhere because our aim is to have the default model of every modality, commercial variants, and national variants. You can have an Indian insurance stable chat. I think you scale when it's ready and when nearly ready, but you don't try to overscale. It is very difficult because to build these models, you need supercomputers. You need all of these things. Once they're built, they can go everywhere, which is amazing operational leverage.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThere was a recent Forbes article that said particularly that you've exaggerated at times about a few different things. Has that made fundraising any more challenging? What about your existing investors? How have they responded to that?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nThe existing investors, we've been having constant dialogue with them. They've been helping through this process. In terms of additional fundraising, again, we're not actively fundraising right now. The interest just continues to go up because ultimately, it says things like AWS partnership. They built us one of the largest supercomputers in the world before funding. We have an amazing partnership. They talk about technology. We've released another amazing image model. We have language models, code models, and more coming.\nI think it's an interesting thing because a year ago, we were a pre-seed startup. Now, we're a scale-up. Next year, we might be a multinational. Growing pains are always there. The ultimate thing is you just have to deliver on what you say you're going to do.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nYou mentioned language model. I know that a few months ago, you released StableLM. What's happening with that now? That was like a pretty early version when it came out.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah. Next week, we're moving to properly open development. We have a blog and a whole series of papers out with that. We had an alpha. Now, we're going to have a beta of it, which is a massive step up from there. Last week, we released kind of Open LLama, which was a replication of kind of Meta's Llama, except for fully open. Now, it's going to be a highly refined version.\nI think what you're going to see with language models now, we just had Qualcomm Cristiano coming on, is that you will probably see GPT-3.5 level performance on the edge by next year if I look at current trends. A large part of that is data. With the right data, you can have a 10x performance increase. That's something we saw when we funded Datacomp on the image side.\nWith a tenth of the data, the app performed OpenAI's CLIP image-to-text model because the data was such high quality. Again, stop feeding the models garbage. Get rid of all the rubbish, and you will have highly efficient architectures.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nI want to go back just for a moment to the Forbes article. This is something you told my colleague Tom McKenzie recently. He asked you about claims in the Forbes article that you have a tendency to exaggerate. You said, I get excited. I'm curious, what guardrails are you putting in place to make sure your storytelling and your narrative match with what's actually happening on the ground?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nI think it's surrounding yourself with good people. I think it's not a sign. I was thinking a lot about this. I've asked birds in ADHD. I have a very definitive view of the future. I think that shocks people because we can't deal with exponentials. What's coming now with generative AI?\nSageMaker has 100,000 SME customers. Every single one will use this technology at the same time as soon as it's enterprise-ready. This is the biggest economic impact and deflationary thing that's going to hit our economy of all time. I say something like that, it sounds like an exaggeration because I'm definitive. It's what I genuinely believe. This is a difficulty I have. I'm doing the best I can. One thing I don't do anymore is I commit to release dates.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOh, OK.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nMy team have been bashing me over the head about that. No more release date commitments, just release when it's ready.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK. I understand that because sometimes with articles, I just kind of say, yeah, it'll be sometime this week.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah, exactly. We nearly had Stable Diffusion ready. It was super fast, but then it just kind of didn't work. We couldn't release it. Yeah. You do the best you can.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOne concern that people have raised in general about generative AI, both text-based and systems that are creating images, is the extent to which startups and large companies alike are looking to bring in people that can work on the ethics side of AI, people who can develop guardrails within companies. What are you doing on this? Do you have any AI emphasis on staff?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nI think it's interesting. My background is in ethics and Islamic law, which is a very different type of ethics in some ways. I'm a computational theologist. We have a safety team that we're building out. We work with kind of RLHF teams and others because the models are first deep learning trained. Then you use RLHF, reinforcement learning with human feedback, to bring them towards human. We have our TRLX library, which is the most popular one from our Copper AI lab. We've been bringing in ethicists and others from external parties to look at that. No one's quite sure what AI ethics is right now.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nNo one's quite sure what.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nWhat AI ethics is right now.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nPart of the thing is to expand the conversation. This is also why we support AIandFaith.org and other things, because the conversation does need to be broadened, because it is so complex. It's hitting every part of society. That's one reason why I was the only AI CEO to sign both of the FLI and safety letters. I think this is a discussion we have to have now, and more voices need to be brought in, because right now, it's mostly guys here in Silicon Valley. I don't think that's correct.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nDo you truly feel that AI is at this moment an existential threat?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nI think it will be like that movie Her, where we're kind of boring, and it'll bug her off. Thanks for all the GPUs. I could be wrong. That's why I think right now, we need to move before the economic impact happens. This is like COVID before Tom Hanks. We haven't had that moment yet. Everyone's talking about it, your mom's talking about it, but it's not real. Next year, it becomes real, and the economic impacts become huge. The existential side from having crap data that we're feeding these models, the whole of YouTube and others. No wonder it turns out weird. Let's feed it better data now, put some proper standards in place, and build AI that is good for us and doesn't work against us.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nIt feels almost like you think that that is inevitable. That's an inevitable outcome. Do you feel like that is an inevitable outcome? I guess from my perspective, I'm like, well, if this hasn't happened yet, there are so many different directions that things could go.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nI think never the same again is an interesting thing.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSay that again?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nNever the same again.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nNo head teacher in a school can set essays for homework anymore because of GPT-4. It's never the same again. I think we're going to see a lot of those, a regime change over the next period. This technology is inevitable. It's up to us. It's going to be a bigger economic impact than COVID. Is it up or down? Is it productivity enhancement? Is it job losses? We're not sure about that. On the existential side, we know well, my view is that if you have an AI that's more capable than you, the only way to fully control it and align it is to remove its freedom. I don't know how to do that for entities that are more capable than me. What I can do is I can teach it better.\nI think the way that you're brought up makes a big difference. We see that in real life. These models are like really talented grads that occasionally go off their meds. We need to fix that. We need to give them better food, better balance. I think it's more likely that we will have a positive future, especially because the bad guys already have the technology. You can just download it on a USB stick. Boom, you've got it.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nWhat is the most pressing challenge Stability AI is working on right now? I know you guys are involved in lots of different things. Sometimes, it's hard for me from the outside to see what you think is the most important.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nWell, the most important challenge for us is to be more transparent when there's so much going on and build the human capital. In particular, the key focus that we have right now is getting language models to the edge. The ability to own your own language models can help you protect against other language models. That will become increasingly convincing. I think everyone needs to be able to own their own models given how powerful they are and how they extend our capabilities. Just like in crypto, there was that phrase, not your keys, not your crypto. I think it's going to be, not your models, not your mind, as we move from here.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nExplain that a little bit more.\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nIf you are outsourcing a lot of your cognitive capability to models that are black boxes and they have inherent biases, it's going to be more and more influential on you versus if you have control of your own models for your private data, your private knowledge, be it as Rachel, as Bloomberg, as a country. It's a question of who controls this technology that both extends your capability, but then you rely on increasingly. That's why I think there needs to be open, flexible alternatives to that.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nMight I not want to do that at all? Might I not want to be involved with that period?\n\nEmad Mostaq\n\nCEO and Founder, Stability AI\n\nYeah. At least you should have the choice. Right now, you do not have the choice. If you want the most advanced technology, it is a black box that can be turned off at any time. OpenAI had an amazing image model, DALL-E 2, that they banned all Ukrainian content from for nine months and all Ukrainians from using. It is completely within their prerogative because of political issues. Imagine if that was the only one and you did not have Stable Diffusion. I do not think that would be nice.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nThank you so much. It was really great to speak with you.\n\nAlexandru Costin\n\nVP of Generative AI and Sensei, Adobe\n\nPleasure, Rachel.\n\nRachel Metz\n\nAI Reporter, Bloomberg Technology\n\nOK.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Bloomberg Technology)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Bloomberg Technology\n\nTime for a short break. Please head out for coffee, stretch your legs, and also, if you would, check out the Chrome Enterprise activation out there, which is an immersive experience in web security. There's a game. I failed it. I think you'll probably do better. Try out the game, and then be back here at 10:55AM for our next set of interviews. Thank you. The program will begin in 10 minutes.

Jessica, I'll now turn over the call to you for your first question.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Well, let's start with the top of du jour, not one, but two strikes. Can you give us your views of how this affects your business on a practical basis? How far out does your original content take you? How much of the content spend do you think gets pushed from 2023 into next year?\nThank you. Well, let's start with the top of du jour, not one, but two strikes. Can you give us your views of how this affects your business on a practical basis? How far out does your original content take you? How much of the content spend do you think gets pushed from 2023 into next year?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks, Jessica. Good afternoon, and thanks for the questions. Let me start by making something absolutely clear. This strike is not an outcome that we wanted. We make deals all the time. We are constantly at the table negotiating with writers, directors, actors, producers, everyone across the industry. We very much hoped to reach an agreement by now. I also wanted to say, if I may, on a personal level, I was raised in a union household. My dad was a member of IBEW Local 640. He was a union electrician. I remember his local because that union was very much a part of our lives when I was growing up. I also remember, on more than one occasion, my dad being out on strike. I remember that because it takes an enormous toll on your family, financially and emotionally.\nThanks, Jessica. Good afternoon, and thanks for the questions.

I remember that because it takes an enormous toll on your family, financially and emotionally.\nYou should know that nobody here, nobody within the AMPTP, and I'm sure nobody at SAG or nobody at the WGA took any of this lightly. We've got a lot of work to do. There are a handful of complicated issues. We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible, one that's equitable, and one that enables the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.\nYou should know that nobody here, nobody within the AMPTP, and I'm sure nobody at SAG or nobody at the WGA took any of this lightly.

Do you run out? At a certain point in time, you probably will.\nIn terms of content, how much original content do you have? Do you run out? At a certain point in time, you probably will.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, look, we've put some of our upcoming content in the letter. We said in the last call, we produce heavily across all kinds of content: TV, film, unscripted, scripted, local, domestic, English, non-English, all those things. They're all true. It's besides the point. The real point is we need to get this strike to a conclusion so that we can all move forward.\nWell, look, we've put some of our upcoming content in the letter.

Let's move on to password sharing, which is something everyone on the call wants to hear about. Can you just give us a kind of state of the union? What progress have you made to date, and will the rollout be complete?\nAbsolutely. Let's move on to password sharing, which is something everyone on the call wants to hear about. Can you just give us a kind of state of the union? What progress have you made to date, and will the rollout be complete?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, Jessica, we've worked really hard iteratively over many months and really even over a year and a half to find an approach that we thought was a good product experience for most consumers, that gave them the information they needed to make clear decisions, that included features they wanted. Think about transferring our profile and your viewing history to a new account, easy ways to manage your devices and account access, being able to purchase that extra membership for a loved one. We've done a good job at building those features, we think, but also in a way that balances those user considerations with making sure that Netflix was able to get reasonably paid when we delivered entertainment to someone. Of course, we could invest that into making the service better for everyone.\nYeah, Jessica, we've worked really hard iteratively over many months and really even over a year and a half to find an approach that we thought was a good product experience for most consumers, that gave them the information they needed to make clear decisions, that included features they wanted.

Of course, we could invest that into making the service better for everyone.\nAs of today, we've now launched that experience in almost all the countries that we operate in. We're seeing that it's working. We're positive in terms of both revenue and subscribers relative to pre-launch in all of our regions. I also think it's important to note that the business impacts of that product experience will roll in over several quarters. It's not an overnight kind of thing because, in part, the interventions are applied gradually, and in part because some bars won't immediately sign up for their own account, but will do so next month or three months or six months or maybe even longer down the line as we launch a title that they're particularly interested in. We're live in the vast majority of countries, over 90% of countries by revenue, and we're going to continue to iterate and execute that model.\nAs of today, we've now launched that experience in almost all the countries that we operate in.

I mean, it feels like there's another wave coming, or maybe several waves. Maybe college students who are home for the summer and will go back in August or September. I don't know that mobile devices have been shut off yet. Anecdotally, many people who are not on mobile devices have said they haven't been cut off yet. Can you help us think through that?\nIs there a way to think about segments of borrowers who have yet to convert? I mean, it feels like there's another wave coming, or maybe several waves.

Anecdotally, many people who are not on mobile devices have said they haven't been cut off yet. Can you help us think through that?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. There are components of it that are essentially what you describe, whether it's because there's behaviors or because of how we've organized the product experience. How those roll out will happen over time. We'll see those interventions broaden to more of those cohorts over a period of time. That's one sort of component of phasing it out. The other component is that we see differential engagement across that borrower population. There are some borrowers who are using the service every day, and those folks are very likely to transfer to their own accounts very soon. Some folks are less engaged, and it's going to take us a little bit longer to convince them to move over with great stories, great TV shows, and films. Both of those effects essentially are what distribute the business impact from this product experience.\nYeah.

What percent have converted to paying? On what plan? How many went to members versus subscribers? Your subscriber numbers were great this quarter, but there were also add-ons to households. Can you help us think through? What kind of did people change plans?\nCan you provide any color on the results? What percent have converted to paying? On what plan? How many went to members versus subscribers? Your subscriber numbers were great this quarter, but there were also add-ons to households. Can you help us think through? What kind of did people change plans?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would say generally what we see is these are well-qualified members. In other words, they are choosing plans and are engaging at rates, have retention characteristics that generally look like higher tenure members. That is good because they are well-qualified. That retention is quite good, in essence. That is a broad way to think about what those borrower cohorts are. That is consistent also with the fact that we will convert essentially those most engaged, most well-qualified borrowers first. That is a general way to think about it. Beyond that, I will not comment on more specific numbers.\nYeah. I would say generally what we see is these are well-qualified members.

It sounds like from your letter that ARM will accelerate in the second half as you get further along in password sharing. Is that correct?\nWell, maybe if you could help us think through, in UCAN, how much of the ARM growth is a function of add-on members to existing accounts versus new subs signing up to higher-priced plans? It sounds like from your letter that ARM will accelerate in the second half as you get further along in password sharing. Is that correct?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks. Yeah. Spencer, do you want to pick this one up?\nThanks. Yeah. Spencer, do you want to pick this one up?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nYeah. Maybe just broadly thinking about our kind of revenue in Q2 and going forward, Jessica, the key is that we delivered revenue in line in Q2 with our expectations, and we're on track to accelerate that revenue in Q3 and further accelerate it in Q4. That's really our primary objective around revenue acceleration, and we're set to deliver on it. If we step back on thinking about our revenue growth and components overall or within a given region, it's driven by a combination of pricing, volume, and new revenue streams like ads. If we think about each one of those, we're now more than a year out from any price adjustments in our big revenue countries. We largely paused them during pay-sharing rollout, and that's to be expected. For ads, that new revenue stream, we've expected a gradual revenue build.\nYeah.

For ads, that new revenue stream, we've expected a gradual revenue build.\nThat's not expected to be a big contributor this year. It continues to be on target. Most of our revenue growth this year is from growth in volume through new paid memberships, and that's largely driven by our pay-sharing rollout. It is our primary revenue accelerator in the year, and we expect that impact, as Greg said, to build over several quarters. That's what we're seeing in each of our regions and in the UK. The UK has a little bit more benefit from ads, per se, because it's a bigger advertising market, but still very, very small overall because it's still nascent to the business.\nThat's not expected to be a big contributor this year.

That is that you dropped the basic plan in Canada several weeks ago, and you just announced that in the US and UK. I guess a couple of questions here. Are there any plans for the rest of the world? Has it so far, from your experience in Canada, driven the response that you hope for? Is the response that more people go to the advertising tier? I guess one other final part of this question is that is it obvious positive for ARPO? I mean, it feels like the impact is $5 or more per month.\nThere's another surprise that you had in the last couple of weeks, which seems like it could also be a very positive driver to ARM.

We think of this as a continuation of what we've generally done for a long period of time, which is think about how do we optimize the plan structure, the pricing, the features that we have with really two goals in mind. One goal is we want to give consumers access across a wide range of price points, so that more people around the world can enjoy the great stories that Bell's team is doing. That means the appropriate spread of prices, and the appropriate corresponding features, including ads, no ads, video quality, number of simultaneous streams. We'll seek to actually add to that list of features over a period of time. The second big goal that we've got in thinking about this is optimizing long-term revenue. That includes a bunch of factors that you might expect. It's sign-up conversion, plan take rate, engagement, retention.\nSure.

That includes a bunch of factors that you might expect. It's sign-up conversion, plan take rate, engagement, retention.\nJust as we evolve from a single plan years ago and have adjusted our offering over time, this latest move reflects what we think will best achieve those goals in the countries that we launched it in: US, UK, and Canada. I think it's also important to note that from that perspective of accessibility and affordability, we think the entry prices that we have right now in those countries, so $6.99 in the United States, $4.99 in the UK, and $5.99 in Canada, represent an amazing entertainment value. Those are attracting a healthy share of sign-ups. In terms of the specific effects that you're talking about, it's pretty much what you would expect, which is when we drop that basic tier, folks that would have signed up for that tier essentially sort into two tiers.\nJust as we evolve from a single plan years ago and have adjusted our offering over time, this latest move reflects what we think will best achieve those goals in the countries that we launched it in: US, UK, and Canada.

We see that sorting. In terms of what we would expect, I mean, we are rolling this out in an iterative fashion across countries, and that allows us to understand the impacts and not be surprised. I think things are generally going as we expect in that regard.\nThey either take the ads plan, which is that really low, attractive entry-level price, or they move into the standard plan.

For your new members or new subs from the password sharing, are there any noticeable differences in churn?\nOne last question, and then I'll move on to advertising. For your new members or new subs from the password sharing, are there any noticeable differences in churn?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, I would say, as I mentioned before, the way to think about these or the way that we're seeing them in terms of the members that are signing up, borrowers that are spinning off right now, I would characterize them as well-qualified. They're folks that have watched Netflix for a long period of time. They know how Netflix works. They're behaving in terms of retention characteristics, churn characteristics, like more higher-tenure subscribers, which is good. That means better retention.\nWell, I would say, as I mentioned before, the way to think about these or the way that we're seeing them in terms of the members that are signing up, borrowers that are spinning off right now, I would characterize them as well-qualified.

Maybe if I can just for a second talk that through because it can get a little complicated.\nJessica, maybe just a number of the questions you were asking is kind of getting at a little bit of a, I think you mentioned ARPO, and we call it ARM or average revenue per member, but what are we kind of seeing in the numbers, and how does that play out as you think about the move out of the basic ad-free tiers you mentioned in Canada and a couple of other countries as of today, and also as we build our ads? Maybe if I can just for a second talk that through because it can get a little complicated.\nIf you think about the drivers of average revenue per member, starting with the revenue drivers that we spoke about a moment ago, you can see our FX-neutral ARM was down 1%, FX-neutral in Q2, and we expect similar in Q3, flat to slightly down. That's mostly due to the limited price adjustments we mentioned over the past year in our big revenue markets in advance of rolling out pay-sharing. There's also some at play here, some movement in plan and country mix shift over time. Most of our member growth over the past year has been outside of UK and Canada, so in lower ARM countries. That plays into the ARM trends. Importantly, over time and over the medium to longer term, we expect ARM will benefit from price adjustments. I mean, we haven't changed our long-term pricing philosophy.\nIf you think about the drivers of average revenue per member, starting with the revenue drivers that we spoke about a moment ago, you can see our FX-neutral ARM was down 1%, FX-neutral in Q2, and we expect similar in Q3, flat to slightly down.

We're still only a small percentage of our members are on the ads tier, even with the moves we just mentioned. Nice growth in the ads tier, but still off a small base. We're really early in terms of pay-sharing impacts, including extra member, for the reasons that Greg mentioned. That's going to build up over multiple quarters. As they do, we'll see all of that demonstrate itself in growth in ARM over time, we would expect.\nIt'll benefit from ads and the extra members that you mentioned.

I mean, one of the things you talked about in the upfront was offering advertisers the ability to go into the top 10, which provides an incredible reach, guaranteed reach, really, all the time. Just talk through some of the ways because you're thinking in ways that are very different from traditional media.\nMoving on to advertising, could you give some color on some of the innovative or non-traditional offerings that you have?

I think stepping back, it's useful to start with we've got a lot of work to grow this business. The first priority that we're focused on is scale. We know that reach is one of the predominant considerations, the dominant considerations that advertisers have when they think about where to go to spend their dollars. We want to be in that top list. We grew ads plan membership almost 100% quarter to quarter. That's good growth, that's a good trajectory, as Spencer mentioned. We want to continue that. That's job number one. Job number two is we've got a really solid list of advertiser-facing features that are not in that innovation category, that are really more following a well-trodden path. We're rolling those out. These are things like verification, their measurement, their targeting.\nYeah. I think stepping back, it's useful to start with we've got a lot of work to grow this business.

There's a bunch of very straightforward work. These follow a well-established path. We just need to do the work. We know we can do it. It's heads down and execute. Then we get to a little bit of what you're talking about, which is an opportunity over time to really think about our offering, both in terms of unique capabilities that we can deliver that blend TV with properties of digital advertising, and also work at the interface of the user experience and the ads experiencing.\nI'd actually include in that bucket building out our go-to-market and sales capabilities in every country so that we can serve more advertisers, and serve them more effectively.

You can see glimpses of that right now. You mentioned top 10. I think that that is a creative way to think about how we give advertisers a different way to have essentially a guaranteed participation in the most popular shows, most popular films at any given moment on Netflix. That's exciting. There's just tons of work ahead of us, tons of opportunity, and we're really focused on continual improvement. We're also confident that all the fundamentals are there and that we can build over those several years a material ads business.\nThat really leverages the core capabilities that we've used for a long, long period of time of UX testing, iterative development, data-driven personalization to establish over time a leadership position in defining what is the premium ads experience on CTV.

It's no change. Our overall ads ARM continues to be higher than basic ad-free globally, same as statement on standard in terms of standard with ads higher than standard ad-free in the US. Generally, we're pleased with our per-member ad economics, and continue to feel really good about the opportunity to grow the ads plan, the ads offering, good for members, good for our business. As Greg said, we've got a lot of work to do to get from here to where it can be, we believe, over time, which is a material, additional, incremental revenue and margin driver for the business.\nI can take it if you want, Greg.

This is a really tepid overall advertising environment. Is there anything you can say about what the reaction's been?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, sure. First of all, it's great to be able to have an opportunity to meet with so many advertisers in a concentrated period and hear what they need from us. That's helpful to synthesize what are our top requirements and how can we better support those advertisers. I think you're absolutely right that the general market is soft. We're seeing that across multiple different companies. We benefit right now from being relatively small, so there's scarcity around our inventories. I think we're able to manage that process effectively. We're seeing good demand and good progress on the upfronts within that sort of broader soft market. Our job really now is to add as quickly as we can advertiser features that meet their needs so that we can make our offering more attractive as we scale that inventory up.\nYeah, sure.

If you're looking for a specific number, we have tens of engineers working on this at this point in time. They're delivering features on a consistent basis. Microsoft has even more than that that are delivering features on a consistent basis.

Both scale in terms of reach and the tech capabilities in terms of features aren't sort of a binary condition. It's not like you have it, you don't have it one day, and then you suddenly have it the next day. I would say we're just constantly iterating and walking up both of those hills. Scale, I'm pretty impressed with being able to get to 100% quarter to quarter growth. That's a good trajectory. I feel that puts us on a good place, and that'll be better and better every year, essentially. The technical features, again, we've got a long list, and it's not as if one day we're magically done.

We don't want to get ahead of our skis, if we will. We've got a lot of blocking and tackling to do. We believe it can be a meaningful part of our business.

No, I think the thing to keep in mind is that as streaming continues to grow, 37% of TV time now in the US, and we continue to grow our share of streaming in that growing space, even though it's very, very competitive. Probably best evidence is for nearly every week of this year, we've had the number one show and the number one film on streaming, which is, that creates an enormous amount of, to your point, Jessica, of possibilities, but all dependent on building those capabilities. As we put those things together, it's an enormous opportunity as eyeballs increasingly move to streaming. By the way, they're moving to streaming because this is where the consumer's demand is running. This isn't like we've invented something and we're dragging them in.\nYeah.

One, just higher certainty in our forecast with the success of the early success of the paid sharing rollout. We also had some move in production timing, just the typical ins and outs of the schedule. Then lastly, the impact of the strikes. There's still a pretty wide range of outcomes for where we're going to ultimately land on cash flow this year given the ongoing strikes. That may also create some lumpiness, actually, between 2023 and 2024. Still with substantial expected free cash flow in 2024, but some lumpiness between the years.

What is normal post the strikes, plural?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, what you've seen is, and what we talked about when our revenue had slowed down in early 2022, is that we would keep our cash content spend roughly flat. That's what we've been doing from 2022 through with the plan through 2024, with the lumpiness that we talked about, some of it because of the kind of coming out of the throes of COVID, as we talked about in the last couple of calls, and now most recently because of the strikes.

It's an awful thing because you see, even in the revelation of their triumph, the initial depth of their despair. I wouldn't change that, but it's not nothing. It's certainly not just happiness.\nIf you want to know something about yourself, sit on your bed one night and say, what's one thing I'm doing wrong that I know I'm doing wrong that I could fix that I would fix? You meditate on that, you'll get an answer. It won't be one you want, but it'll be the necessary one. When you're trapped, some of it's your own inadequacy.

Can you do me a favor if you're listening to this and hit the subscribe button, the follow button, wherever you're listening to this podcast? Thank you so much. The conversation you guys have been waiting for. I say that because of the thousands and thousands of messages I've had since I announced that Jordan Peterson, the man himself, all the way from Canada, came here to sit in my kitchen and have a conversation with me. What a conversation it was. One of the most moving moments in the history of this podcast takes place in this conversation. I think the thing that people love about Jordan Peterson is his unrelenting desire to just say what he believes to be true, not what he believes to be correct, not what people want to hear, not what people will be happy to hear.\nQuick one.

I wasn't. I think I was wearing a mask in my relationships in the context of I didn't express how I was thinking and feeling. I was trying to be who I thought my partner wanted me to be. At the point when I let down the mask and I started speaking my truth, actually, as I was departing from the relationship, the relationship got stronger than ever before. It was like we were never actually connected until I was being true with her, with my feelings, with what I wanted, with my life. Since then, I would categorize my relationship as being the strongest thing I've ever seen in terms of a romantic connection with someone.\nI believe it's really difficult to truly connect with someone if you're not speaking and being your truth.

I mean, you just said that part of it was a disconnect between who you were trying to be and who you really were. That's a persona issue, right? You think maybe, and everyone has this proclivity to some degree, they're deeply self-conscious and uncertain. Instead of allowing the person they're with to connect with that underlying uncertainty and inadequacy, they act out a persona. The problem is that, well, perhaps the person falls in love with that persona, but there's no real connection there.

It's an artifice.\nHaving said that, one of the things that Carl Jung, the great psychotherapist, said about a persona is, don't be thinking that you're better off if you never formed one. For Jung, it was a voyage from, say, undifferentiated self in infancy and so forth through persona to authenticity because you have to act out your ideals to some degree, right? You also have to formulate an avatar of yourself in some sense that's a mediator between you and other people in casual social encounters. Like, you don't want to walk into the bank and have the teller tell you about his or her day when you say, how are you doing, right? I mean, now and then that can happen, but generally, it's too much intimacy too quickly.

If you're a puppet and an actor, and Pinocchio is both at times in that movie, both a puppet and an actor, why an actor? Like, why is there something wrong with being an actor?

You'll improve unbelievably rapidly.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhat you're talking about there sounds to me a lot like an overdose of arrogance, and also the need for humility.

Well, that's a temptation, right? I mean, when the radical lefty types go after people for their unearned privilege, they have a point. The point is the existentialists called it thrownness, which is not—that's a Heideggerian term. Thrownness is the fact that we kind of experience life as if we're tossed into it, thrown into it. You're male and not female. You're Hindu and not Christian. You're tall and not short. You have an arbitrary range of talents and an arbitrary range of limitations, none of which, in some sense, you chose. It's the cards you're dealt. Some of those are cards of privilege. Maybe you're born intelligent. Maybe you're born symmetrical. Maybe you're born healthy. Maybe you're born into a culture where it's much easier not to be absolutely deprived. Maybe your parents are rich.\nOf course. Well, that's a temptation, right? I mean, when the radical lefty types go after people for their unearned privilege, they have a point.

Along with that comes a good dose of existential guilt because at the same time, and this is true for anyone, regardless of their cultural background, the ground we walk on is soaked in the blood of historical atrocity. That's on you because people think, well, who's the Nazi? Well, it's the fascist, or who's the radical communist? It's the radical left-wing ideologue. The fundamental truth of the matter is that's best dealt with as a spiritual matter. The adversary is within, really, most profoundly. You have to take the responsibility for that historical atrocity onto yourself. I was talking to Guy Ritchie this week about his movie, King Arthur.

Well, think about that. You have weapons at your disposal, but they've been used by your murderous uncle. How dare you wield them? The answer is maybe it's easy just to leave the sword on the ground because you do want to be responsible for atrocities going forward and don't think you couldn't be and don't think you might not enjoy it. The way you pay for your privilege is with your virtue. I mean that most particularly.

I think it's very difficult for us to understand our embodied environments well enough to duplicate them in a healthy and comprehensive manner in the virtual world because we just don't understand what it is that we're doing when we actually do things rather than represent them. For example, I've thought a lot about online university. You could imagine, well, you can certainly imagine online lecture courses. You could say the fact that they can be delivered on a large scale very inexpensively is a virtue. You can bring the knowledge to a very large number of people at a low cost, so why not do that?

An excuse for young, a credible excuse that's socially sanctioned for young people who have not yet established a career goal to adopt an identity of upward striving for four years away from their parents while they meet a new group of friends.

Now, a couple of them came to college with me, so I had a toehold there. I made an entirely different group of friends, and they were friends whose goals were quite radically different from the friends that I, let's say, in some sense, left behind. The reformulation of my peer network might have been the most important part of the first part of my education. I was fortunate at this place. It was called Grand Prairie College. I had seven professors, seven, which is really good, who really loved to teach. I also learned a lot in the formal sense. While I was doing that, I was also negotiating, well, how much partying do you actually do? Because zero isn't the right amount.\nIn many ways, I left the peers that I had been associating with.

I really liked living with him because he was a tough guy. Worked in lead smelters, and he was a cowboy, and he was a tough guy, four years older than me, about three years older than me.

People whose houses are built on foundations of sand, and the wind starts to blow, and the floods start to rise, and they are in such trouble, such trouble.

It's really interesting because what we tend to see at this time of year is the first thing that goes is our diet, quickly followed by our fitness. We see that in the data across multiple surveys. People in the fourth quarter of the year start indulging a little bit more, which is totally fine, and they start exercising a little bit less, which is totally fine. However, a really useful crutch during this period where the seasons have changed and we're starting to behave a little bit differently is making sure your fridge is stocked with things that are nutritionally complete, healthy, and that are going to be convenient for you to consume without compromising your health. That is where, ladies and gentlemen, Huel comes in.\nQuick one. I can't talk about Huel enough in my life, especially right now.

For a lot of people, this is the first time, for a certain generation, this is the first time they've experienced such unpredictable tectonic destabilization in their lives.

    "content4": "Well, we'll see with regard to the pandemic because although in some sense it is in some ways over, our reaction to it is by no means over. Part of the reason that we overreacted, I would say, so precipitously to it is that we were unprepared for such things in our naivety. We rushed to imitate a totalitarian society in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic emergence. That's something that everybody should think about a lot. We're not done with all that totalitarian nonsense yet. A lot of that's driven by, well, fear and naivety. I mean, 50% of Democrats in the United States believe you have a 50% chance of being hospitalized with COVID.

I've had conversations with people advising at the highest level of government, particularly in Canada, who've told me flat out, and they're very reliable sources, that none of the COVID policy for the last year was driven by reliance on science. It's all opinion poll. That's really pernicious because, well, who's asking the questions, how did they set up the answer, and who's answering and in what emotional state? To what degree are we led by considerations of short-term propitiation of unwarranted fear? Well, that's no way for free people to live. It certainly won't work in the long run.\nYou can point a finger at people and laugh at their ignorance, but you should really ask, well, why is this overestimate of that magnitude, and what does that mean in relationship to policy?

None of that has sorted itself out yet. I believe that we will conclude that our response to the pandemic caused more death and misery than the pandemic itself. We have no endgame in sight. Another thing I asked the people that I was speaking with is like, when is this over? Well, we don't know. Well, what would over look like? We don't really know. Now what you see is this insistence on about a monthly basis that a new and radically different variant has emerged. This virus—viruses mutate all the time, but this virus particularly mutates. There are small mutations and medium-sized mutations, numbers, let's say, and also effect and larger scale mutations.\nWe're already seeing tremendous supply chain disruptions and likely the emergence of an inflationary pressure that we haven't experienced since the 1970s in the aftermath of the oil shocks.

Well, how about whenever it's convenient for the pharmaceutical companies? You think, well, that's cynical. It's, is it now? The biggest lawsuits in the history of the American judicial system have been levied against the largest pharmaceutical companies on a regular basis for the last 20 years. Since when has it been a proposition of the political left that pharmaceutical companies necessarily have our best interests in mind? Now, I'm not particularly cynical about pharmaceutical companies. I think they have a hard job, both in terms of research and development, and marketing and sales. They're going to do what they can to market and sell. That doesn't mean that they are now to be the arbiters of all public policy because our politicians are too cowardly and incompetent to do anything but devolve their responsibilities to so-called experts, domain experts.\nWhen is that a variant?

That's medicine. Politics is the art of analyzing the entire situation and charting a course forward, all things considered. For politicians to trot out the experts and say, follow the science, just means that they've abdicated their own responsibilities. I think it's appalling. I mean, I'm not convinced that the evidence that masks work is scientifically credible. It's certainly at least doubtful. That's just masks. I read a paper the other day suggesting that to prevent the transmission of one case of COVID, you have to lock down 1,000 people. How is that justifiable, especially given that the mortality rate of COVID is actually quite low unless you have a pre-existent health problem, particularly obesity, and although old age also qualifies as it does for most diseases, but not all.\nPolitics is not public health.

I don't think there's any scientific justification for immunizing children under 12. Now, at least it's debatable. I'm not a domain expert, although I'm a decent scientist and I know how to read the research material. We'll see what we have to learn from these tectonic shifts underneath. You might ask yourself, well, was that a tectonic shift in dire physical necessity because the COVID virus was genuinely so dangerous, or was it an indication tectonically of our absolute inadequacy in the face of even a moderate existential challenge? Maybe it's a little column A and a little column B.\nWith regards to, let's say, the issue of child vaccination, it's like children have an unbelievably tiny chance of dying from COVID.

I'd rather do what I'm doing. I'm in contact with people working politically all the time, both on the people in the middle, people on the right, people on the left. I'm agnostic about that because I know full well that conservatives have something to say, and left-leaning liberals have something to say.

That's kind of conservative virtues there, but they tend to be lower in creativity, openness to experience. They don't think as divergently, and their conscientiousness tends to constrain their creativity. Whereas the liberal types, they're high in openness to experience.

I will say, What words should I use? They'll say, Well, if you loved me, you'd know. I would say, No, I'm stupid and ignorant, and I don't know what the right words are to satisfy you. Why don't you give me a hand with that and I'll utter them inelegantly and awkwardly in a good faith demonstration of my commitment to peace.

It requires the person who's after you to think through the question even of whether there's anything that could be said or done that would satisfy them.\nIf the answer to that is no, well, probably the relationship is over. Certainly, the person that they're accusing has been put in an absolutely impossible position. Usually, almost inevitably, if the person meditates on it for a bit, there is something that would satisfy them that can be negotiated as long as they're willing to give you the opportunity to do it stupidly and badly. Listening, man. Jimmy Carr, I talked to Jimmy Carr two weeks ago, the famous comedian. Yeah, it was real interesting. He said, comedy is the most dialogical of the entertainment forms. I thought, what do you mean by that? Because you're just talking. It's a monologue, right? Now, I do monologues, but I pay attention to the audience, right?\nIf the answer to that is no, well, probably the relationship is over.

Even though it's a lecture, let's say, or a talk, I'm watching the audience and responding. We're in a kind of dance. Well, Carr pointed out that comedians, before they hit the road, and this is virtually invariably the case, have their new routines, their corpus of potentially funny jokes, and then they do 200 shows in front of small audiences. The audience either laughs or doesn't. If you're listening, you collect all the jokes that people laugh at. If you do that 200 times, you have nothing but hilarious material. You listened, and then you can go out on the road. That was very interesting to me because humor is a mysterious phenomenon experientially and conceptually.\nI'm always talking to individual people in the audience and watching their reactions, listening to the audience as a whole.

It's so interesting that we can criticize and elevate ourselves at the same time, and that we find that intensely pleasurable.

Jimmy Carr was on two weeks ago, and we had a great conversation about happiness and the nature of happiness. The guest before Jimmy Carr wrote in my diary, which is a tradition we have now, where all the guests that come on write a question for the next guest. There is a question there for you. The guest wrote a question which changed his life, which is, are you happy? From reading your work and understanding your position on happiness and it not being the thing to aim for, which really struck me because I thought life was the north star of our lives was to try and be happy.

Because we ask that question with good intentions. Are you happy? What's a better question for me to ask Jordan Peterson?\nThe question I was going to, it was pretty much that is, what is a better question for me to ask you if I'm checking in on you? Because we ask that question with good intentions. Are you happy? What's a better question for me to ask Jordan Peterson?\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nHow are you doing?\nHow are you doing?\nHow are you doing? How are you doing?\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nHow are you doing? How are you doing?\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nBrilliantly and terribly. That's. You know, when you listen to a profound piece of music, one that sort of spans the whole emotional experience, it's not happy. Happy is elevator music. Probably you just shouldn't listen to that at all. Right? You think, why? Well, it's harmless. It's treacly, it's sweet, it's simple, it lacks depth, it's shallow. That's a problem. It doesn't have that deep sense of awe and horror, I would say, that is characteristic of the best of all music. You know, you listen to some simple music, so-called. Hank Williams is a good example, the blues cowboy from the 1950s who died of alcoholism when he was 27 and whose voice sounds like an 80-year-old man. Simple melody, but there's nothing simple in the song and in the voice. It's deep, it's like the blues.\nIt's like Black blues in the States from the '20s. It was certainly influenced by that tradition. There's this admission of a deep suffering at the same time as you get the beautiful transcendence of the music. That's meaning. That's awful in the most fundamental sense. You need an antidote to suffering. It has to be deep. Deep moves you tectonically. It's not a trivial thing. That's better than happiness. Maybe if you're lucky, while you're pursuing that and while you're immersed in it, you get to be happy. You should fall on your knees and be grateful for that when it happens. It's a gift. It really is a gift. It comes upon you unexpectedly, your happiness. You aim to climb uphill to the highest peak you can possibly envision. That's better than happiness.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhy did you include terribly?\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nWell, for example, now when I go wherever I go in the world, people come up to me. They're usually, I wouldn't say they're happy to see me. They're often in tears, and they often have a pretty rough story to relate. They were suicidal, or nihilistic, or homicidal, or trapped, desperate. They tell me that real fast, and then they say, I've overcome that to a large degree.\nThank you for that. You think, well, that's really something to have that happen over and over. In some ways, you might think, well, how could anything better possibly happen to you than to have people come up to you all over the world, strangers, and open themselves up like that, like they're old friends so quickly? At the same time, it's an awful thing because you see even in the revelation of their triumph, the initial depth of their despair. I wouldn't change that. It's not nothing. It's certainly not just happiness. It's better than happiness. It's almost unbearable. God, tears again. It's been quite two weeks in the UK. It's been amazing. It's been amazing. Such a great country, this country. Such a profound place.\nIt was so wonderful to see Cambridge and Oxford and to be welcomed by the students.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nI saw the queues around the block and the reaction you got. I watched the talk in Cambridge. It was so wonderful to see because I know that you don't do what you do for credit. That kind of seems to be the antithesis of pursuing your truth and doing it in the cause of truth. It was so wonderful to see someone that I know has had such a profound impact on so many be received in such a way. We have a closing tradition. One of the, I don't know if I do this, but one of the really great CEOs in our country, a young guy who's built a multi-billion dollar company, really great guy, sat here yesterday. I actually told him for the first time who he was writing the question for. I couldn't believe his face.\nOh my God, that's the one person I want to have dinner with. This is probably the most successful young person in our country. He knew who he was writing the question for. The question that the previous guest wrote for you is, why do you do what you do?\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nTo see what will happen. Some programs you cannot predict, right? You cannot predict how they're going to end. You have to run them. Well, I believe that truth will save the world. I believe that. You speak truthfully, and you watch what happens, and you take your consequences. Maybe you hope and have some faith that in the final analysis, things will work out in your favor. Perhaps they will and perhaps they won't. That's faith. That's faith. Faith isn't believing in things you regard as ridiculous, sacrificing your intellect. It's a decision. Will truth, beauty, and love save the world? You can find out.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThank you doesn't seem to quite cut it for the impact you've had even on me, and also for giving me your time. I know you understand the tremendous value of time. I've seen it so much in your work. I'm going to say thank you, but I'm also going to make a commitment to do something which I think is more important, which is just to be truthful. I think with the platform I have, and the years I have ahead of me, maybe that's the greatest good that I can do to the world. Because you've come here, that's a pledge and a commitment I want to make to you as my highest form of thanks that I can give in a karmic way. Hopefully, that will make the world a better place for everybody.\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nWell, at least it will help ensure that you won't make the world a worse place.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThank you so much for everything.\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nThank you.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThank you.\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nAuthor, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\n\nMuch appreciated.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThank you, Jonah. Thank you so much. Are you looking to make a sustainable switch in your life? As some of you will know, I'm on a bit of a sustainability journey at the moment, which means me and my team are always thinking about ways that we can make what we do here as a business, but also our individual lives more sustainable and more environmentally conscious. That's where a brand like MyEnergy comes in. They are the industry leader in the sustainable energy industry in our country. One of my favorite products from MyEnergy is called the Zapy, which I have in my hands here. It's simply an EV charger which allows you to charge your electric vehicle from solar or wind power, meaning that it's super user-friendly while saving you both time and money.\nIf you want to check them out, and I suggest that you do, head to myenergy.com to find out more.

People will do what you want without ever even realizing it. Seduction is a mating ritual. You can't just swipe and get it. Because of all the dating apps, if you are able to understand the language of seduction, you're going to have so much more power and success than anybody else. One thing about words is people can lie, but body language, it doesn't lie. You master that language, you can start deciphering all the stuff people are giving you. It's about psychology, and it's about how you carry yourself.

What do I need to know about you and your earliest years to understand the life that you went on, that journey you went on, and the person you came to be?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, I grew up here in Los Angeles, not far from where we are, in a neighborhood called Baldwin Hills. We moved to another neighborhood. I had a very nice childhood, very middle-class family. My father was a salesman his whole life, worked for the same company for 40 years, just sold chemical supplies. My parents kind of left me alone a lot. My sister almost kind of raised me in a way. I had a very nice childhood, kind of left alone, sort of an introvert. Books kind of shaped me. I became an avid reader at an early age. I knew I wanted to be a writer. Got heavily into drugs, I'm afraid, in high school because that was the time where I went to school and in college. Had some great experiences.\nI look very fondly back even on my drug experiences, even though they got kind of depressing after a while. It kind of shaped me in some ways. That was me growing up. I had an attitude or a lens in which I looked at people from a distance. I was always sort of obsessed with people who wore masks and the way I looked at it. Even when I looked at my parents and their friends, I said, what is really going on behind the masks that they wear and all the social niceties going on? What is behind? What is really the human animal like? These are kind of the themes that were a big part of me growing up.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nFrom what I read, you had a lot of different jobs in a lot of different industries up until the point when you wrote the first of your many books called The 48 Laws of Power back in 1998. I was looking at all of these different jobs you'd had, and they all seemed to be completely different from one another. Trying to understand how you arrived at a moment where you then wrote a book on the topic and subject matter of power, having not been a psychology graduate or seemingly worked in any industry related to human psychology, seemed to be really peculiar to me.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nYeah. I never really had a lot of power up until that point. It wasn't like I knew everything about being a leader or anything. A lot of things that happen in life are kind of by coincidence or serendipitous. You don't necessarily plan on it, which is sort of when you look back on it, you can see kind of an odd plan going on, like a destiny or fate. In the moment, I didn't feel that. I had all of these different jobs, as you mentioned, some of them completely unrelated. I worked in construction. I had a construction job. I worked in a detective agency. I was a tour guide, I helped write an encyclopedia, I taught English in Spain, on and on and on and on and on. I was searching.\nI wanted to be a writer, and a writer needs experiences. I just was hungry for weird experiences. I never really stuck at any one job. By the time you're 37, 38, my parents are starting to worry about me. I'm starting to worry about me. I'm getting a little bit depressed. Even have moments where suicidal thoughts are floating in my brain. I'm very ambitious. I know I could do something well, but it's never come together. Here's the serendipity part. I'm in Italy for a job, one of my 80 different jobs. I meet a man who's a book packager there on this particular job we're on. He's a Dutchman. I'm not going to imitate him, but he asked me if I had any ideas for a book.\nSuddenly, all of the painful experiences in my life working in Hollywood, all the assholes I've worked for, all these weird politicking, all the manipulative games, all the crap that I had seen, it just came almost vomiting out of me. I said, you know, here we are. Well, this was 19th century back then. Here we are in the late 20th century. People don't dress like they did in the days of Machiavelli, right? They don't wear wigs and stuff. It's the same damn thing. It's the same bloody battles going on, the same manipulations, the same kind of people don't reveal who they are. It's a timeless game of power, just the same as Louis XIV or Cesare Borgia or the people, the CEOs in the late 20th century. It's this timeless thing. As I'm telling him this, his eyes are lighting.\nHe's like, wow, this could really be a book. He said, look, Robert, I'll pay you to live while you write half the book, and then we'll sell it. As I told you before, I was desperate. It was my get-rich-or-die-trying moment. I went back to Los Angeles. I borrowed money from my parents because I was that poor. I wrote a treatment, and he loved it. The rest is history. That's sort of my long-winded answer to your question.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThat's so interesting. It's crazy how in life things can just take such a turn out of nothing. You never know what that thing is going to be. I mean, you say the rest is history there. Give me an idea of the success of that book, The 48 Laws of Power, because I mean, I've seen it everywhere for as long as I've been looking at books. Give me some quantify the global success of that book.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nQuantify?\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nYeah.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, here in the US, it's sold quite a bit over 2 million copies, which is great. The weird thing is it's selling now more than it ever has sold before. In other words, the percentage of books that we're selling here in 2023 is greater than any period before. It's accelerating, which is insane. Even my English publisher is telling me the same stuff. It's kind of accumulated. It started off a little bit slowly. I mean, we got press, but it became this kind of cult thing. I've had very little publicity in mainstream media, which was big back then. It's not big anymore, thank God. It was word of mouth. It's like, have you heard about this book? It's kind of dark, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It got on a few television shows. There was this show, a reality show with boxers.\nI think it was called The Contender, in which the finalist held up a copy of the book and said, this book helped me get to where I am now. It sold like crazy. It got into the hip-hop stream. Jay-Z was the first person I ever saw quoting the book in print and in Playboy interview. Then 50 Cent and all that, and Drake and all these people. That really kind of set it into the stratosphere. It's slowly become a bigger and bigger thing. I had no idea. I thought it was a weird book, and it could be successful, but I had no idea the journey I was about to begin. It's weird.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO",
    "content5": "That journey of writing this book, have your feelings towards the book evolved or changed over time? Because society moves on, you move on as an individual, as a human, you learn new things, you mature, and then the book has kind of held in time.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nNot really. My philosophy in life is never look back, regret nothing. It's there. I did it. It came in a particular moment in my life and in the zeitgeist. Things have changed a little bit. It was a very serious effort to try and get at something timeless. Now, yes, there's a dark side to it, and maybe I've moved on from that. Honestly, when I wrote my fourth book, Mastery, I was a little bit concerned that young people were thinking that the whole game of life is about politics, manipulation. I wrote a book to kind of counter that. I think the book is true, and it's held up.\nI think if I look at business, what's going on in the business world, I kind of got I think I hit it on the nail about what goes on and the dynamics and the power game. I wrote a book on human nature, and the idea is we were formed hundreds of thousands of years ago in particular circumstances. Our brains are wired a certain way. Yes, we're very sophisticated. Yes, we have the internet. Yes, I'm here being interviewed by you on a podcast. It's pretty insane. We haven't fundamentally changed. The same raw emotions of envy, of aggression, of worrying about our status, about having to disguise ourselves and appear like we're saintly and loving, that we don't have a shadow, which we all have. None of that has changed. Yeah, I wouldn't write that book now because I'm at a different place in life.\nI understand that. I'm not ashamed of it in any way. I stand by it, and I think I hit at something real.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nIn your definition, what is power? I was really compelled when you were talking about the evolutionary roots of power. At its essence, what is power?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nIt's not what you think it is. It's not Vladimir Putin or presidents or Biden or all these political figures and these big games. Power is a feeling, it's an essence, it's an emotion, it's a human need and desire. Really, what power is, is a sense of understanding yourself and being able to control yourself. The way I look at it, I like to look at it not through the lens of great power politics, but as an average everyday human being here in the United States or in England.\nThe feeling that you have with your children, with your spouse, with your colleagues, the people who work for you, the sense that you have no control, that you can't influence them with your ideas, that you can't get them to maybe soften some of their ugly behavior if they have that, that you can't get them interested in helping you with a project or whatever, is the most miserable feeling a human being can have. Malcolm X had a quote that I love, which is, absolute power corrupts, but absolute powerless corrupts even more. I'm butchering it, but that was the gist of it. The feeling of powerlessness is actually more corrupting than the feeling of having a lot of power. It turns people into being passive-aggressive, into playing all kinds of weird games, negative games to get power.\nYou want to feel that you have a degree of control over events in your life, over people, over your future. That, to me, is what power is, right? Some of that involves these games that I mentioned in there, and some of it goes beyond the 48 Laws of Power, which I've tried to indicate in my other books. It's the sense that I'm not helpless in this world. I remember when I first entered the work world as a very naive college graduate with all these ideals and things I'd read because I studied literature and languages, going, man, this is weird. People are playing all these kinds of games. I'm in over my head. I made mistakes. I got fired for being too brash, for outshine the master. It was painful, right?\nLearning, you don't have to abuse the laws of power. I don't advocate crushing your enemy totally. I hope I don't have any enemies ever that I need to crush ever. You just need to know these things so that when you enter the work world, you're not naive, you're not stupid, you don't make the same kind of mistakes that I made, you spare yourself the pain. You understand the most fundamental thing about human nature. People have egos. Even your boss has an ego. You think he or she doesn't because they're powerful, but they're even more insecure than other people. You need to be aware of these things so that you don't inadvertently make them feel insecure and suffer the consequences. I don't know. That's sort of my idea of power that I was trying to describe there.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThe way you describe it is more of a sort of intrinsic force, perception of yourself. When people think of power, they think of having control over others, or their influence over others. You've kind of made it more of an internal force.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nYeah. Well, if you can't control yourself, then you're in a lot of trouble in this world, right? Because when you just naturally are yourself doing things, you're going to offend people. You learn early on we're social animals. I have to tailor my behavior. If you go on babbling all about how you feel and think, etc., and you just say what's the first thing on your mind, you're going to end up having a very short career. You're going to be saying things that are going to offend people, making a fool of yourself, and saying things that you end up regretting, right? You have no self-control. If you see somebody who has no self-control, it makes you look like you're not powerful. If you can't control yourself, how can you control anything in your environment?\nHow can you be a leader, right? You have to learn certain things about your nature, about who you are, and not just be anybody. You have to kind of tailor your appearances as well. For good or for bad, I'm a believer in looking at the human animal without shame and embarrassment, just as we are, right? Appearances matter. It's the animal part of our nature. We look at and we judge people by how they appear, how they dress, their tone of voice, their body language, etc., etc. In an ideal world, we wouldn't judge people by appearances. We would just judge them by what's inside of them. Yes, I agree with that. We're not ideal. We're not descended from angels. We're descended from primates. You have to understand that appearances matter. This is part of the game.\nYou have to control your appearances a little bit. You have to tailor it. You have to be a bit of an actor in this world, on and on. These are things that people don't like to admit about ourselves. We like to think that we're much more idealistic, that these things really don't matter in the end. I wish it were that way, but it's not. I'm a bit more of a realist when it comes to things like that. Yeah.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nAs you were talking about this need to keep up appearances to some degree in order to survive and to fit into the tribes that we form in our lives, it made me think about how many guests I've had on this podcast who work in maybe the entertainment industry or other industries. They're famous, whatever. They report that keeping up appearances had a really detrimental impact on their happiness and their fulfillment in life because in some cases, it meant that they were doing a job as a presenter and had to always be happy when inside they didn't feel that. Maybe the contrast of reality and perception caused them a lot of harm, or they've built a life around things that they're not interested in. I think you touched on some of that in Mastery.\nThat's the question I have, which is keeping up appearances and the impact that that has on your happiness, i.e., wearing a mask and happiness. What's the relationship?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nI talk about it in the 48 Laws of Power where you have to play this game in life. To me, it's a form of wisdom, which is a wisdom that used to exist in the 18th century. I read a book that had a big impact on me many years ago called The Fall of Public Man by Richard Sennett, in which he described café life in London in the 18th century or France. He was saying back then, when you entered the public arena or your café, you knew you were an actor. You left the house, you put on a mask, and you had fun. You knew it was like fun. It was play. When you're a child, you like playing games. You like putting on costumes. You like playing your parents or some character you saw on TV. It's part of human nature.\nWe like to play these games. We're role players. We're actors. He was saying in the 18th century, that was just a given in life that when you entered the public realm, you knew you were an actor. When you went home to your wife, your family, or your husband or wherever, you dropped the mask. You breathed a deep sigh of relief, go, now I can be who I am, right? It wasn't a problem. It didn't create neuroses. It didn't create this like, what's wrong with me? I don't know who I am anymore. The problem now is we don't have distance from that social realm. We think that if we're acting, that's who we are. It's not. It's just that's part of being a social animal, is playing a role.\nI did a book with 50 Cent, and he kind of exemplifies a lot of that. He plays a role in life. When I met him, I thought, uh-oh. I was kind of intimidated. I was a little bit afraid. The thug. This is a guy who, when I met him, he was just a few years away from being shot and all this stuff. I met him, and he was the nicest person in the world. He was almost kind of sweet. He'd hate it if I said that word, but he was sweet, right? He was very down to earth. He was very calm, etc. He's playing a role when he goes out and he plays that person. He knows it. He knows it's like he doesn't take it seriously. He had this big beef with Kanye West back when I was doing the book with him.\nI met the two of them in Vegas when they were there for the awards. They were like the best of friends. They were joking. It was just a game they were playing, right? What I tell people is we all are actors. Humans are born actors. We learn at a very early age to play that kind of game. It's kind of fun sometimes to do that. Have a enjoy that part of life, but don't think that it don't get it confused with who you are in your essence. That's sort of the dance you're playing between those two things. I understand what you're saying. A lot of it has to do, as you said, related to Mastery, where people end up in a career that doesn't suit them. I think I understand what you're getting at.\nWhen I look at presenters or people in the news, and they have to smile and be so cheerful, they're like, man, what a drag. I'd hate to be like that. That is so false. Don't you feel kind of, don't you want to take a shower after being so cheerful and chatty and all that shit? Yeah, I understand that. If that's the profession you chose and you love it, then maybe you don't feel that way. I couldn't do it personally. I think it's okay to think of yourself as an actor. I don't think there's anything wrong about that.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThe second very curious law in your book that I uncovered was law number two. We're talking about the 48 Laws of Power here where it says, never trust friends too much, learn how to use enemies. Do you trust your friends?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nOkay. Well, everything in the book is context. When you take things out of context, it's a little harder to understand. What I'm trying to say in that, I'm talking about in the work world when you're out in the social realm. One of the worst things that people do is you have a job, and I've been guilty of it myself even after I wrote the damn book. You're out in the work world, and you need to hire somebody. You need to find a colleague. You need to find a partner or an employee. Your mind naturally gravitates towards a friend, right? Because they know you, you trust them, you have a relationship, and you feel comfortable with them. It's a terrible mistake. So many of the worst things that have happened in history are because of that very problem.\nBecause friends, there's all these emotions involved between people, right? Those emotions confuse the issue. What I'm talking about in that law is when you need to get results, you need to think when you have a job or something, you have to think in practical terms, not in terms of emotions, not in terms of friendship, etc., etc. You want to keep your work world separate. Not everything about life is having to be friends, having nice things, and everybody like you. Sometimes what matters is getting results done. Sometimes the best person to work with isn't your friend because they don't have all this other stuff that we're talking about. In fact, a very powerful move is if there's an enemy out there, somebody who you never got along with, if you approach them and say, let's bury the hatchet.\nI have a job, and I'd really like you to work with me. I know you're really smart. The turnaround of emotions is a very powerful thing where they're going, wow, yeah, sure, that's great, I never expected that. They're highly motivated to now prove that they're worthy of your change of mind. It's not about not trusting your friends in the realm of friendship in personal relationships. It's about being aware that the work world is different from the realm of personal relationships.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThe other point I found really curious was point three about concealing your intentions. I find this curious because I've never really known where to land on this when people ask me for advice on this subject matter about how much of your hand should you show, whether it's in business, life, or whatever. There's a group of people that think you should always just keep everything you're doing and your intentions totally secret because then people might copy you, or they'll attack you, or whatever. There's another school of thought that says when you're building something, when you're doing something, when you have a mission, you need to share it with as many people as possible because that will galvanize people to come along with the journey with you, and they'll want to support you and help you.\nWhen I read point number three about concealing your intentions, I wanted to ask you about what you think about that. Which side do you land on?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, everything depends on circumstances. The laws are never meant to apply to every situation, right? When it's with your own team and you're trying to inspire them, you're trying to give them a vision, you're trying to get them on your side, yeah, you share your vision with them. You share, this is where the group is going, this is where I want things to be in three years, let's all get together, we're trying to do something very positive for the world. Okay, here's my plan, right? There are circumstances where revealing everything about what you're planning to do is actually very counterproductive, right? The business world in the 21st century is extremely competitive. It's getting worse and worse by the day as more and more people now are entering the power arena.\nI think it's a great thing where it used to be just a realm where only older white men had power, and now the doors have opened to everyone. The level of competition is that much more intense, particularly now even with the internet. You have rivals out there. You have competitors out there. Even as we talk right now, maybe you're not thinking about them, but they are. They're going to steal your ideas. They're looking to take your business away from you, etc., etc. Just be aware of that phenomenon. Just always saying what you're planning on doing isn't always the wisest thing to do. Sometimes if you're in a tricky situation, putting people off the scent and giving them a red herring and saying, I'm planning to do this one. In fact, you're planning to do that. It's a very powerful technique.\nIt's deception, but also fair in love and war and business, I'm afraid. There are moments where you don't want to lay all your cards out on the table, right? You want to either create a little bit of mystery so that people don't know what you're going to do next, and they're wondering what you're going to do next. As they're wondering what you're going to do next, they're kind of on their heels a little bit. What's the next thing that Stephen is planning? I don't really know. Wow. It's a very powerful approach. There are other times and other experiences and moments in life where you do want to reveal what you're planning to do because there's a purpose behind it. I'm just saying, be aware. Don't just act in this world. Be aware. Have a strategic mindset.\nSometimes concealing is what you need to do. Sometimes not concealing is what you need to do.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nIt's funny. When we have this conversation about power and the darkness and the shadows that people have in them, I think a lot of people listening, and probably it seems that way because I'm the one asking the questions, is if I'm questioning society that I'm not part of, they'll think they might think they don't play these games, right? That's the question I have, is like, have you ever encountered anybody? Do you believe there's anybody out there that doesn't play power games, manipulation, have shadows, have darkness in them?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nNo, I don't. In my war book, I read the biography of Mahatma Gandhi, one of the saintliest figures in history, right? I realized that Mahatma Gandhi was actually a brilliant strategist. Now, I'm not saying his use of nonviolence and civil disobedience didn't come from the heart. He didn't mean it. He didn't actually believe in the peaceful weapon. He did. He was very sincere. He was very strategic about it. He planned a campaign, several campaigns like the Salt March in the 1920s, where he knew, for instance, that the English public was very liberal-minded. They had this ideal of themselves as being this very, they weren't colonialists. They weren't imperialists. They were doing the best for the world.\nHe deliberately had these marches where he knew that they would be reading in their newspaper and seeing photographs of Indian people being beaten up by Englishmen and their Indian officers on the streets of wherever. It would have a terrible impact on the public. He thought in terms of strategy. Okay. There's Gandhi. Then there's Martin Luther King, who is somebody I wrote about a lot in The Laws of Human Nature. Another great icon whom I admire who actually was inspired by Gandhi and had campaigns of civil disobedience. There was a campaign, I believe it was in Montgomery or Selma. I can't remember which one, where he was getting fed up. They weren't getting very far. The civil rights movement, they were reaching a stalemate, and he was getting very frustrated.\nAn advisor came to him and said, look, we're going to have this massive march, and I can get a lot of elementary school and junior high school students to be on this march because they believe in you, and they're very fervent. I think it would be great. His advisors go, God, you can't do that. You can't put 13-year-olds at risk. Martin Luther King thought about it very deeply. He said, no, we're going to go ahead and do it. Because damn it, I want the American public sitting in there all fat and watching their televisions to see these brutal Bill Connor, the police chief then. I want to see these children being water hosed and beaten, and it's going to have an incredible impact. He was being strategic, and his advisors were shocked by it.\nIt ended up proving to be one of the most pivotal and important moments in the civil rights movement. Here you have Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Martin Luther King was a flawed individual, as we know, right? He had a private life that wasn't exactly the same as his public life. I don't judge him for that because he was a brilliant man, and I admire him. I love him deeply. Reading his biography made me admire him even more, seeing that he had a human, flawed side to him. These are icons that we set up, and they reveal what I'm talking about in human nature. You can't escape it. Yeah, maybe there was some saint born in some century that I've never heard of that maybe got pretty far away from everything I've talked about.\nWe all have this idea like in The Laws of Human Nature, I write about irrationality, envy, aggression, or narcissism. Narcissism is a good one. Oh, they're a narcissist. I'm not a narcissist. I'm not self-absorbed, but they are. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have any of those traits. Well, damn it. Every single human being has self-absorption traits. We can't help it. We naturally think of ourselves first. Yes, there are people who are much deeper narcissists in life, no doubt, and there are toxic narcissists, but we all have a touch of it.\nI want you to be a little more humble in this world and not be so arrogant, and not think that you are somehow exempt from having a dark side, that somehow you were born with a halo over your head, that you were born different, you don't have human nature, that you're a saintly person, you're much better. Get rid of your moral superiority because I find that deeply offensive. We are all cut from the same cloth. We all have the same flaws. When you look at yourself, and when I wrote The Laws of Human Nature, I'm going, Damn it, Robert. You have a dark side. You're a narcissist. I had to come to terms with my irrationality, my grandiosity, my aggressive instincts. It's the only way to change yourself is to be aware that you have these issues. I have the narcissistic tendencies.\nNow I see it. All right. Now when they pop up, I can control it better. I can say, Damn, Robert, you're being too self-absorbed. You're thinking more about the other person. If you go around in life thinking, I don't have any of these problems. I'm not a narcissist, you're never going to have the awareness to stop the fact that you are actually one.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nBeing a narcissist, is that objectively a good or a bad thing? Because when you were obviously, I know people are having a—it's a bad thing. A narcissist causes a lot of harm, and that's very true. In the context of the human animal and why the human animal develops certain attributes and qualities to maybe further its survival or its ability to stay within the social pact, is it just a consequence of being a human to have these shadow traits and to be coercive and manipulative? Is it good or is it bad? Or is it neither?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nIt's neither. Neither. Because it just is, right? With narcissism, for instance, there's a reason why we're narcissists. I explain in the book—it's not my own theory. It comes from some great psychologists like Kohut—the origins of narcissism, right? When you have to leave you—when your parents have to kind of not abandon you, but have to not give you as much attention as you used to have, and you're three years old or four years old, you don't remember it, but it was very painful. Like, oh, they don't love me as much. What's wrong with me, right? I have to get that love and attention, not just naturally. I have to do things to earn it, etc., etc.\nWhat happens with a lot of people in that situation when you're a child is I have to develop my own—I have to be my own mother or father. I have to find a way of loving myself. When something bad happens, I have to retreat inward and go, I'm really not so bad at all. I'm actually a decent person. I like my own tastes. I like the clothes that I wear, etc., etc. You're developing the shreds of self-esteem, right? People who never developed that because they were abused, they were abandoned, or even if they were suffocated, never developed that self-esteem. What happens in life is if you don't develop that and you get older and people attack you, yell at you, or criticize you, you can't retreat inward to that self-esteem, that love you have.\nThe only thing you know is to get angry, to get—they call it narcissistic rage, and to yell at people and say, God, get away from me. You're evil, etc., etc., etc., right? Then the other problems evolve where the only way I don't have that inner self-esteem, the only way I can get people to love me is by being incredibly dramatic and overly dramatic, etc., etc., etc., and always making myself the center of attention. That's what creates a deep narcissist. That's their only way of getting the love that they need. Children, we all need that degree of self-esteem, that anchor in our life. Narcissism, self-love is not a bad thing. What happens is as you get older, if you go too deep into it, it becomes a problem.\nWhat I say is you need to take that self-love that has a good function and turn it outward as much as you can, and turn it into empathy, love, and consideration for other people, more or less your task as you get older in life. That's how I approach all of these flaws. You can't run away from them. You can't run away from your shadow, your dark side. You can make it work for you. You can make it positive, productive, and healthy. You can become a healthy narcissist, which is a name that I use in the book. You can use your dark side for positive purposes. Let's say you have a lot of anger inside, and I had a lot of anger when I was younger. I was a very angry young man, right? Channel that into some kind of cause.\nI have a lot of causes that I believe in very deeply. When I was younger, I was like that. Channel that energy into something productive and helpful, and put it into something that goes to something that helps society. That's using your dark side for positive purposes. Because the dark side of human nature has a lot of creativity, has a lot of energy. An artist has to have a dark side. You use your dark side because all those dark emotions, all the people that shadow you in your life, they inspire you. They create your best work. Don't run away from your shadow. Don't run away from your narcissism. Use it in a healthy way.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nI think that's the hardest thing for people to do, right? So few people, I think, including myself, have really fully understood what their shadow and their dark side is. I mean, doing this podcast has really helped me because I learn things from other people vicariously, and then I reflect on myself. Well, keeping a diary has helped me to understand that. That first step in someone having the self-awareness to understand their dark side. I mean, there's even a lot of people who confronting their dark side would be so—it feels like it would be so impactful on their self-esteem in a negative sense that they spend their life putting up a wall to never go there. I mean, there's some people who you even mention something to them, and they would.\nTriggers.\nTriggers them. We can all think of those people. We can all think of those people. The really interesting thing there is the role that your early years play on your relationship with power. Because when I think about some of the nicest—I don't know if this is just a stereotype or a narrow observation I've had, but some of the nicest people I've met in terms of being the opposite of whatever a toxic narcissist is, seem to have really comfortable, loving, secure, safe, early experiences. Is that broadly true in your view?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nIt's a generalization, but there is some truth to it. I mean, there's things called attachment theories where psychologists have looked at the kind of attachment you had to your parents, and they categorize it in four different ways. There's the ideal, the best one, where you have this incredibly loving mother and father, and they're giving you unconditional love, but they know also how to give you your independence, etc. It's not terribly common. I don't know what the percentage would be. There are levels and levels, and as you get to the fourth level, it's like the abandonment one or abusive and abandonment, where you basically leave the child alone. You don't give it any attention, any love, and it's very crippling, right? The thing is, children are much stronger than we think they are. They're very resilient, they're very resourceful.\nThey're going to find their love. They're going to find a way to compensate for it in some way. What's something very interesting, when I was doing seduction in some of my other books, and I look at people who were very charismatic, like a Malcolm X, like a Marilyn Monroe, I could go on and on and on. These are people that came from very, very bad families, right? They had no love. Marilyn Monroe was an orphan, essentially, raised in an orphanage. Her whole life was, I got to get people to love me. I need love so desperately. Her way of doing it was to literally make love with the camera. Nobody had ever done that before. You could sense that she needed it, and it was so powerful that you sensed it that she drew it to herself. Great charismatic individuals. John F.\nKennedy is someone who had a lot of charisma. He came from a very bad childhood, right? His father was very mean to him, etc. Some children, in the worst circumstances, it ends up bringing the best out of them. They have to find their way in life. Some people who have everything don't go very far because they don't know how to find things for themselves. Life is weird. Some people who have great childhoods do well. Some people who have great childhoods are spoiled and never learn how to get things on their own. Some people have the shittiest childhoods, learn how to be resourceful, and get what they need on their own.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nYou mentioned seduction there, the art of seduction. Why did you write a book about the topic of seduction?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nSeduction is a high form of power because you make people feel pleasure. You make them feel excited or interested in you, and then their resistance to your ideas slowly lowers, and you have the ability to influence them and to move them in the direction that you want. If you yell at them, like we were talking about your child, and you tell them, do this, do that, they resent it, and for good reason. If you're subtler, if you're more seductive in your approach, if you're more indirect, people will do what you want or go in your direction without ever even realizing it. It was a subtheme in the 48 Laws of Power. I was sort of interested in the psychology of that and why some people are good at it and some people are awkward about it.\nWhen I finished the 48 Laws of Power, I thought this would be a natural segue to the next book.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhat are the qualities of a great seducer?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, I like to distinguish between cold seducers and warm seducers. A cold seducer is something you don't want to be. That's the typical image that we might have of a male seducer, but even of a female seducer, like the great courtesans, etc., that are just after money or the men are just after sex. That's not my ideal. My ideal is kind of a back-and-forth quality where it's not domination. It's sort of like a game that you're playing. It's like a mating game. It's like a courtship ritual where both people are kind of seducing each other. What makes for a great seducer is very simple. I can summarize it very simply. You are outer-directed.\nWhen you meet somebody for the first time or you're on a date or whatever it is, you're not having that internal monologue going, does she like me or does he like me? Am I dressed well? Am I saying stupid things? What can I do to impress them? No. You turn it off, and you're outer-directed, and you're listening to them, and you're entering their spirit, and you're hearing them say things that give you an idea of what they're missing in life, of what they want, of what their needs are, of what makes them an individual. You're absorbing it. You're entering into their spirit, and then you can reflect it back to them. You can give them gifts. You can take them to places that show that you're attentive to them.\nIf you look at how we are in our day-to-day life, normally people never pay us attention. They're always so self-absorbed, they're never thinking about us. The times where you get the sense that people are actually interested in who you are as an individual is pretty rare. If you give that feeling to someone, it's incredibly powerful because we all want to be validated, we all want to be recognized. The seducer is not someone who's all worried about him or herself and thinking. They're involved in the other person, they're absorbed like a sponge inside their psychology, inside their world.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nA lot of this is very applicable to romance and dating, etc., etc. It feels, for whatever reason, not necessarily something I've read much about in your work, but it feels like dating, romance, and relationships have become much more complicated in the modern world. It's become much more difficult to seduce somebody. What are the attributes of someone then that is not good at seducing?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nAnti-seducer has many qualities. I have a whole chapter on the anti-seducer. I try and define it. There are several of them. I do not have them all memorized, but one quality that is very anti-seductive is preaching and moralizing. It is like telling people, oh, that is wrong what you just said, or, your politics are ugly, or, you are not really good at this, or something or other. Having a moral superiority, a sense of sanctimony in a realm which should be about pleasure, where it should be that kind of equality, that kind of back-and-forth dynamic, where you are asserting your moral superiority is deeply, deeply anti-seductive, the element of preaching to people. Not being generous, and I mean not just with money. Money is important, but not being generous with your spirit, right? You want to be open.\nYou want to give as much as you can to the other person of yourself, of your time, of your money, of your energy, etc. Being all kind of crimped and, I don't want to give. I don't want to spend money. I want to take you to the cheap place to eat. I don't want to give you much time, is very, very anti-seductive.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhen you were talking a second ago about the person who goes on the date and they're thinking about themselves, what their hair looks like, or whatever else, that spoke to an insecure person. Is insecurity a seductive quality, or is it an anti-seductive quality?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nIt is anti-seductive. Now, there is a part of weakness that is seductive. I would say vulnerability is seductive, but insecurity is anti-seductive. There's a big difference.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhy does vulnerability draw people to you?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nBecause the sense—if I can define seduction in simple terms, most of the time we are closed to the influence of other people. Particularly now, we have these walls up because life is harsh. People are coming at us with their advertisements, with their pleas, with their wanting money, with this, that, and the other. We've all learned to be very defensive, right? Seduction is an openness, is the opposite of that. You felt it when you were a child towards your parents. You felt very vulnerable and open. There was an element of your parents and how they treated you that was very much like a seduction, right? Seduction is about being open to the other person to the extent where you can even fall in love. You can fall under their spell.\nThe sense of letting go of your ego, letting go of your defensiveness, and letting another person enter your world is being seduced. It requires vulnerability. If you meet—the typical scenario is of a man who's not vulnerable at all. He's so powerful and in control, and everything has no vulnerabilities. It's frightening for a woman. It could be very frightening. He's so strong. He's so invulnerable that there's something wrong about it. Maybe he's a serial killer. Maybe he's got skeletons in his closet. Something isn't right about that. What seduces you about a puppy, about a child, about an animal is their vulnerability. It makes you want to hug them. It makes you want to help them, right? The sense which if you came upon a tiger that's there and that they don't need that, well, that's not seductive.\nI mean, on your screen it is, but if they're there in your living room, that's not seductive. That puppy is, right? Vulnerability, the sense that somebody needs protection or help, brings out qualities in us that we don't normally have, that I think allow for seduction. That is being vulnerable. That is, I can be influenced by that other person. I am open to their spirit, right? That's being vulnerable. The word vulnerable, I hate to sound like a professor here, so excuse me, it's seduction, comes from the root of it, means a wound, fullness. You have a wound inside of you, and you need healing. The other person naturally wants to help you, right? Being insecure means, I'm so self-absorbed, I'm so worried about myself that I can't get out of it. We've all had that experience.\nWhen you meet somebody and you can sense, you can smell their insecurity in them, I'm not judging them because we all have insecurities, it makes you feel insecure. It makes you feel a little bit awkward. Whereas if you meet someone who's not like that, who's confident, etc., it brings out that quality in you. If you're on a date and there's someone who's, you smell that kind of insecurity, it makes you awkward and insecure. It creates a kind of a problem. That would be the difference between the two.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThere's going to be a lot of people listening to this that are single and ready to mingle. What advice would you give them in terms of being great at dating? You've talked about the importance of vulnerability there, and how that kind of forms connection between humans in a very innate way. What else is great dating advice for the single people out there?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, the thing is, okay, there are several things. First of all, we live in a culture where people think you shouldn't have to put effort into something like love and romance. You should just be who you are, man. I don't have to put on a role. I don't have to play a game. That's manipulative, blah, blah, blah, blah. No, I'm sorry. Love and romance is something that is almost biological. If you look at animals and mating rituals, they're incredibly elaborate. Seduction is a mating ritual. The worst thing you can feel is that this person isn't putting any effort into something. Let's just say it's from the woman's point of view. This man, he just shows up wearing jeans and his usual sloppy outfit. He doesn't comb his hair, etc., etc., etc.\nHe takes me to the pub for dinner on our first date. He's not thinking about me. He's not willing to put any effort into it. If he's not willing to put any effort into it, what's it going to be like three months down the line when he completely takes me for granted, which is what happens in a relationship? Am I not important enough, right? Whereas the ability to have a little bit of effort, to think of it as kind of theater and drama, and that there's nothing evil about that. I'm going to dress nicely. I don't have to be fancy, just that I'm going to put some effort into how I look. I'm going to take her to a place that isn't—I'm not talking about candlelights and roses and that kind of crap. You can be creative.\nIt can be somewhere that's scuzzy, that's on the wrong side of town, but it's different, and it's appealing to—and you put some thought into it. There's a reason you're taking her there, right?\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nI have a friend who went on a date, and she came back from the date and was complaining because the person that she went on that first date with was using a—took her to a spot where he had an available valid discount code, like two to one.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nOh, wow. Talk about anti-seduction. There you go.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhy is that anti-seductive? In that case, one might say that male is being economically savvy, financially savvy.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nIf you're not able to let go of your kind of tightness when it comes to a woman, something's wrong with you, man. Just let go. Spend some extra money. Spend the extra $10 that you might need to spend on taking her to someplace different. It signals a kind of cheapness. It's not about money, it's about a cheapness in your spirit, right? She's not worth letting go. Okay, maybe you don't have that much, but my God, you have enough. It's not going to make—if you're that poor, then okay, maybe. Probably not. You can afford it. Show that it means something to you. Seduction is a language. It's not a language of words, it's a language of gestures that we're paying attention to. We're paying attention to people's body language, we're paying attention to their actions, to the things that they never say.\nWhen you signal that discounts are so important to you that even on the first date you have to have a discount, you're signaling that there's something tight about you in your nature, and it's not very pleasant.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nFrom doing this podcast and speaking about topics like love, sex, dating, and dating apps even, one of the comments I saw quite frequently was from young men who are struggling to seduce a woman or vice versa. Specifically, young men that—I read some stats. I think Scott Galloway came on the podcast and talked about how—I'm going to butcher these numbers, but a staggering amount of men haven't had sex, and young men haven't had sex in the last 12 months. When I looked at the comment section, specifically on YouTube, I kind of saw that energy reflected, where it looked like young men in particular were struggling to seduce a mate, a partner in the modern world. Is that real in your view? Is there something that has changed in society? Has that always been the case?\nIs there anything we can do if we're a young man that's struggling in the modern world because of the internet, computers, and this, and dating apps?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, a lot of it is, I'm afraid to say, is internet porn, where you get the idea that sex is something that should be very easy and quick, and that women should look, have that kind of body and physique, etc., etc. That becomes your norm, etc. That can be very damaging. The idea that things must come easy and quick is very prevalent. To win over someone, let's say you're a man and it's a woman who might be reluctant to have sex for good reason or reluctant to have a relationship, requires some effort. It requires some thinking. You can't just hack your way. You can't just swipe and get it. You can have your internet sex, but you're not going to get that in real life. It doesn't work that way. It takes time. It takes patience.\nYou're going to have to work at it. You're going to be rejected. Being with people is a skill. Being a social animal, although there's a part that comes naturally, if you spend all of your time here, you're losing that skill of how to respond to people's body language. Half of the thing is you're sitting in a bar opposite, let's say it's a woman, and how she crosses her legs, how she sips her drink, how she looks at you, how she touches her hair. She's signaling things. It's a language. It's a beautiful language, right? You have to learn it. You're not going to learn it here because you can't. You have to be in person. It has to be skin to skin. You have to get a feel of what other people are thinking and feeling.\nWe're actually really, really good at that. That's what makes us human. It's called mirror neurons. I can sense what's going on in your mind. I can read your body language. You have to get out in the world, and you have to put yourself physically out there and try and try and try and have rejection. I know it sounds awful, but it is a skill in a way where you're learning how to understand and deal with people, and understand who they are, and get inside their spirit. It takes time, effort, and patience. For young men, you have to realize that, right? If you think everything has to be easy and quick, it's never going to work for you.\nI talk about the actor, the Hollywood actor, Errol Flynn, who is perhaps numerically the greatest male seducer ever because it's estimated that he had seduced close to 3,000 women, and he died when he was 50. I did the math one day, I go, how can that possibly be? I tried to research what was his secret, and it was hard to find out. Finally, I found a book written by a woman whom he had seduced, another actress. She said he was so relaxed and so comfortable. It was like being—it was like an animal-type thing. When I would sit with him, it was almost as if I had drunk two martinis just sitting next to him. His comfort, his security, and his confidence, his relaxed attitude, it just made me drunk.\nFeeling relaxed, feeling confident, and not defensive and comfortable with yourself is a very powerful seductive quality. I mean, there are many of them, but that's one that I would point out.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nHave you ever figured out what builds confidence? Earlier on, you were talking about how children need to experience things firsthand. You can't just tell them. You can't just tell someone, for example, to be confident. Preaching doesn't seem to work. What is it in your view that does build that true—you also can't fake confidence. I remember we talked about rejection a second ago. I was rejected by pretty much every girl that I was pursuing between the ages of 16 and I'd say 22.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nReally?\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nYeah. Do you know what it was? I was faking confidence. It all changed when I actually had a sense of security in myself. In the period where I was faking confidence, I was pretending I was confident. It was like they just could read past it. That's almost how I look back on the situation. I came to learn that you can't fake confidence. You can't pretend to be it because there are so many sort of micro-expressions that end up reading more like insecurity than confidence. What is real confidence, and how does one build it in your view?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, you've kind of answered your own question there in a way. Fake confidence is like bravado, right? You're putting on an act. Particularly women who've had to deal with this for millennia, they can smell it. They can sense it. It doesn't have to—it's not in your words. It's the body language, etc., etc. Real confidence comes from actual actions, from your actual things you've accomplished, right? When you're 22, 21, it's hard to have that confidence because what is it based on? Maybe it's based, okay, maybe you're really good-looking if you happen to have that good fortune, and you can feel confident about that, and you don't have to try so hard. All right, maybe that might work. Maybe you're really good at sports, or maybe you're a really good dancer, or you're a really great singer.\nIt's based on something real. You have a skill. You have something that separates you. You have something that you can do, that you can accomplish. When you're 21, it's hard to have those. I look back on myself when I was that age. I had nothing. No wonder I got rejected. It comes from what you do in life, okay? The finest sense of confidence is actually creating things, having success, meeting goals, achieving things, and having a record of that. Maybe what goes with that is having some money, but it's not necessarily because you don't have to have a lot of money. You don't have to be good-looking to seduce. That's a myth that I try to explode in The Art of Seduction. Some of the greatest seducers, male and female, were not good-looking at all.\nIt's about psychology, and it's about how you carry yourself. The confidence comes from actually what you can do, not how you feel or what you say. Well, it is how you feel, but the feeling is based on things that you actually can do, skills that you have that separate you, that make you feel really confident, so.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO",
    "content6": "Body language. I find it fascinating that there are quotes and things that say 80% of our communication is non-verbal, etc., etc. Body language is so interesting to me because, again, I think that's one of the things that it's just impossibly hard to fake. I was reading a couple of books on—there was a phase when I was, I don't know, 20, probably just after being rejected all the time, when I was maybe 22, where I started reading books from pickup artists. They would obsess on the topic of body language. One of the things they'd say is—I was explaining this to my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago—that when a man is lower confidence and when he's desperate, he does this thing called pecking in a nightclub where he'll lean in and shout in your ear.\nWhen he's higher confidence, he kind of leans out, and he'll wait for you to lean in. Small things like that, subtleties like that, that intuitively we're reading, understanding, communicating, etc. Someone that doesn't have the confidence probably isn't even aware that they do. When I reflect on my rejection phase, I think, gosh, my body language must have been exuding desperation, low status, low value, low self-esteem. What's your thoughts on body language and?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, in my last book, Human Nature, I wrote a whole chapter on it. I quoted the figure 95%, but who knows what it really is. The thing is that we evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before language existed, right? Our earliest ancestors depended on the group for their survival and getting along. Their powers came from observing other people and their body language. You could read it. It's a skill that's wired into us, wired into our brains. It's a very unique skill that we humans have. It's just that you don't learn that. When you're a child, when you're two years old, you have it because your life depends on it. You have to see if your mother is loving you or your father is kind to you because if not, you could be abandoned. Your life depends on it.\nYou're great at reading that. Children are incredibly adept at picking up body language. If someone is fake, if someone's an imposter, they hate being around children because children see through you like radar, right? They're so attuned to it. You had that skill when you were very young, but you lost it because you became so oriented with words, and you became so self-absorbed that you're not paying attention. It's extremely important, right? The whole body is involved in it. You've got to first stop thinking about people's words so much because the one thing about words, unfortunately, is people can lie. They can say whatever they want. They can say, I love your screenplay. That was fantastic. You were great in that movie. I thought you were great, etc. They can say anything to please, to flatter, to control you.\nBody language, man, it doesn't lie, right? I talk in that book about the eyes and the fake smile. The fake smile is something you see every single day, but you're not paying attention. It's kind of tight, right? Right? A real smile, the whole face gets animated, and there's a little crinkly thing here as your face, as it lights up, and your eyes light up. It's hard to even put into words, but it's there. You can see it. It's real. It's not faked. Knowing the difference between a fake and a real smile is really important in seduction, in business, or whatever. To know if someone is like, yeah, I like that idea. No, they don't really. They're saying that to please you. They actually hate your idea. You master that language, you can start deciphering all this bullshit people are giving you.\nThe face, you can disguise it a little bit. Actors know that. You know what you can't fake? It's your voice. If you're nervous, not even the finest actors in the world can fake that. Your voice betrays so many things about you. It betrays your weakness. It betrays your lack of confidence, or it betrays the other quality, etc., right? Pay really attention to the tone of people's voices, to how fast they talk. People who talk fast are very nervous. Someone who's talking—I know I'm probably talking a little too fast here. Sorry. My mind races, so I do that. Normally, I don't talk so fast. You talk slowly. You have a certain tone. You have a certain intonation. That kind of reveals confidence, okay? Body language, posture. You were talking about pecking, right?\nWhen you go and look at a meeting of people in a business meeting, you'll see all the employees kind of leaning forward, nervous. You'll see the boss kind of leaning back, arms crossed like this. I'm the powerful one. You come to me. I'm the leader. I'm the top dog, or she, it's a woman. I don't need to be like this. I'm like this. Body language reveals a lot about leadership qualities, etc., etc., etc. If you go—you're at a party, and you come up to someone that you're meeting for the first time, and they're talking to you, and you notice that their feet are angling away from you, that means that they're not really—they're looking for any moment to try and walk away and escape. They're not really into you. Whereas their feet are facing you, they're engaged. They want to talk to you, right?\nThis is a whole art you can learn. You can sit there, and you can read it. I talk about—I give this story in Laws of Human Nature of a man named Milton Erickson, the founder of NLP and hypnotherapy, probably one of the most brilliant psychologists who ever lived. When Milton Erickson was 19 years old or so, he had polio. He nearly died. His entire body was paralyzed. The only thing he could move, the only muscle he could move, were his eyeballs. Now imagine that. He was a young man with a very active mind. He can't talk. He can't do anything. All he can do is move his eyeballs a little bit. He was so bored. Can you imagine how bored you'd be like that? You can't read. You can't do anything. People would come in to visit him.\nAll he could do was look at them and study them. He became the greatest reader of body language ever in the history of mankind. People said he almost had ESP. He could read everything about who they were just by looking because he ended up recovering. He became a psychologist. Because his life depended on developing this skill, he was going to just die from sheer boredom if he didn't learn how to read body language. He mastered that language much like somebody could master French. It's an incredibly powerful language that I can't emphasize enough.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWe can go about learning the language of body language, and I'm sure that will help. It's such a complex—there's like a thousand things with my body language at all times, like how I'm speaking, my eyeballs, where I'm looking, my posture, my arms. Am I crossing my arms? Am I crossing my legs? All of these things. The challenge of mastering all of that feels a little bit overwhelming. Am I right in assuming the easier challenge to master is, in fact, just like my sense of self?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nVery well put.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nIf you feel confident, if you feel secure, if you're not all inward and insecure and worried about yourself, it will naturally radiate through your gestures, yeah. You don't have to sit there and pay attention to your fingers, your arm, your ears, your eyes. It's just there. It's natural. Yeah, that is the solution. The two parts of the game, it's your own body language. Be aware that people are judging you for that, right? You can't, as you say, be monitoring everything, or you'll drive yourself crazy, and you'll look very weird, right? The best solution is to feel these certain things that are going to radiate and to not give the fake smile, but when you're really happy, to just show it and show your emotion that way.\nThe other side, which is more, I think, really important, is learning other people's body language. That can come from study and is much more a logical thing than constantly thinking about everything that you do. Your next book that I have here, Mastery. Why did you write a book called Mastery?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, to be honest with you, the idea for it was around the year 2010, 2009. I was getting a little worried that people who were reading my books, particularly young men who were reading Power and Seduction, they were thinking, that's all I need in life, man. I just need to be a manipulator. I just need to play political games. That's what success is all about. I was worried that if you don't understand how to make something, what's going to be the future of mankind? Are bridges just going to fall down? Are hotels going to collapse? People don't know how to make things anymore. We don't know how to use our hands anymore, right? Being able to be good with people is extremely important as a social animal.\nPerhaps higher up in the hierarchy is being able to do things, to be able to have great skill, and to be able to create something and know how to master a subject and to build something that can last. That's really important. I'm feeling like because young people—this is back in 2010, imagine now—have this idea that everything comes quick and easy because you can click, click, click, and things come to you, that everything in life should be that way, that we're becoming alienated from the human brain and how the human brain operates because the human brain requires time. If you know how the human brain operates, we have what are called neural pathways. Every time you repeat something, a neural pathway is created and strengthened and strengthened and strengthened. It's why we get addicted to things, but it's also why we develop skill.\nIf I'm sitting there shooting free throws day in and day out, my brain is wiring it. It's learning it. It's learning that motor skill, that hand-mind thing, and it's getting better and better and better at it. It takes time. It takes repetition to build those pathways. I explained in Mastery that you reach the proverbial 10,000 hours, which some people dispute nowadays. It's just a number. It's not a fact. You have spent so long learning something that there's so many pathways. It's like this amazing inner landscape with all these connections going on in your brain. Now you can be creative. Now you can come up with things that nobody's ever thought of. You can play chess on a higher level.\nYou can be Pelé on soccer or Lionel Messi making passes that no one had ever seen before because you're not having to think, right? You don't have to think anymore. Your body just does what it wants. Imagine 20,000 hours, which is possibly just people sometimes attain in certain fields. You're almost like a genius, you're almost like superhuman, right? If you're someone who's so locked into the internet to getting things instantly, you can't get past 100 hours, let alone 10,000. You're never going to develop skill, and you're going to find life really, really difficult for you. I wrote the book because I was actually deeply worried that we were losing a part of how the human brain operates, something elemental part of our wisdom.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThe interesting through line between that and the subject matter we've discussed in Power and Seduction is that by learning to master something, you build that sense of self-esteem and confidence that we're looking for to be good at the former topics mentioned. On the topic of Mastery, the first chapter in this book, and really the first question a lot of people ask is this question about finding your passion. I've always had a difficult relationship with this question because it sometimes assumes that there's one of them and that you have to go in search of it somewhere. In the first chapter of your book, you talk about discovering your life task. Why is it important? Is it the same thing? Is finding your passion and finding your life task the same thing?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nNo, I just recorded this yesterday on my own podcast. I went on a rant about how it's not about passion. It's not about finding your passion. I actually don't like that word, passion. It kind of makes me cringe because if you think about it, passion, to succeed at anything requires time, effort, boredom, and tedium. Let's just say a simple example. You're learning to play the piano. When you first sit down at the piano, you have to play these really insipid tunes. It's so boring. You have to learn—I forget what they call it—finger exercises and scales on any instrument. You have to learn scales, etc. It's tedious, man. If you think it's got to be passion, forget it. You're never going to get far.\nThe thrill comes after a year of playing the piano, and you get better at it and better and better. Now it starts coming fun. After 10 years, it's more fun. After 20 years, it's fantastic. I'm not trying to name-drop here, but the other night I had dinner with Stevie Wonder. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. I wish I'd interviewed him for my book. Speaking of genius, and he's blind, obviously, everybody knows. I was watching him. He performed for us. We were there with a group of friends at his recording studio. I was watching him play the piano, and he's blind, right? He's improvising. It's just absolutely brilliant and amazing.\nAs I'm seeing this, I'm thinking, I could see the thousands of hours he's been putting in just touching these keyboards and knowing where the keys are. It was just mind-blowing how amazing it was. That is the power that the human brain naturally has through hours and hours and hours of effort. That's how it works. He didn't get there because it was passion. He got there because he was a child prodigy at the age of 11. He was signed to a contract with Motown Records, right? He was playing that as he was a kid, hour after hour after hour after hour. He had a love for the piano, but it wasn't like every time he sat down, it had to be passionate about it. He had the patience to put up with all of the boring stuff, okay?\nYou want to discover what you were meant to, what you have a connection to, what you have a love for, right, when you're a child, hopefully, or when you're 18 or 19 or 20. That's the best time to discover it, all right? You decide, and it doesn't have to be something highfalutin or worth intellectual. You could be great with your hands, you could be great with your body, you could be great with images and visuals, you could be great with words, you could be great in many different areas, okay? They're all equal, they're all great. You, as a child, are naturally—so there's a book I always recommend for people called Frames of Mind by Howard Gardner, in which he talks about the five forms of intelligence that humans have. Each brain, biogenetically, is wired in one direction or the other.\nYou want to know that. You want to feel it inside of you. It's like a feeling. It's not an intellectual thing. You feel when you're doing sports that it's good. It's a natural thing. It's what I'm meant for. When you're involved with words, like I was when I was eight years old, it felt right. It felt like a natural fit. I have to follow this path. When you're three or four years old and it's music like Stevie Wonder and you're hearing this in your head, wow, that's it for me, right? Okay? You feel it. You feel this connection, right? Now you fast forward to when you're 18 or 19 years old and you're having to make a career choice. I call that your 20s, the most important phase of your life that's going to make or break you in some way.\nIf you spend your 20s trying to learn skill in something that connects to you deeply, right, then things are going to happen to you by the time you reach 30. You've discovered your life's task. It may not be something so specific. For me, it was writing words, but I didn't know what to write. I tried novels, I tried journalism, I tried theater, I tried screenwriting. You know it. It gives you a direction, and you try and you try and try. You know that's what you were meant for, that's what you were destined for. You feel connected to it, you feel a love for it, and when it comes time to do the tedious stuff, you're able to do it because you know in the end, it'll pay rewards. You'll get better and better at it.\nThe connection is so deep that to not do it would be miserable. You can't think of everything in life having to be pleasurable and having to be passionate. There's going to be boredom, there's going to be tedium. How do I deal with it? You have to feel a greater love than just mere pleasure or passion. It's got to be something so deep within you that to not do it will make you deeply unhappy. For me, not to write or be a writer, I don't think I'd be alive right now. I would have been so miserable. I would have been so alienated from who I am. That's what'll get you through. That's what a life's task is.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhen you think about that, in the book, you talk about the first phase, which is your apprenticeship on your journey to Mastery. When you're in that apprenticeship phase, when you're maybe early in your career, you're early on your journey to becoming the pianist, the violinist, the podcaster, the entrepreneur, whatever, what are the most important things to be selecting for as it relates to the job you take, the people you're around, that kind of thing? If there's a 23-year-old listening to this that is an apprentice at a floristry shop making bouquets of flower, and they're being offered five different jobs in the industry of floristry, which one should they be looking at if they're in the early steps of their apprenticeship?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nVery easy question to answer. Thank you. You want to look for the job that offers you the most possibilities of learning. If you're going to go to a florist shop where there's only one other person there, it's like an entrepreneur who started it, and you're going to be like their right-hand man or woman, and you're going to learn. The pay is half of what you could get at this very fancy—you could be working at the shop at some department store where they'd pay you triple. Take the job that pays 1/3 where you're going to learn the most. You're going to learn about the business. You're going to learn from the ground up. There's going to be a level of excitement where we might not survive another few months. We've got to work hard. We've got to be motivated.\nWe're all on the same page here. A lot of people, when they're 23, they grab the job with the biggest paycheck. That's a mistake because if you go to a large firm, you're kind of lost. You don't have as much responsibility. You suddenly have to deal with all the political games, the 48 Laws of Power. You're not paying attention, you're not developing skills as much, you don't have as much responsibility. Take the job that has one-half the salary, but you're responsible. You're going to be learning, and it's up to you. That's the most important thing you can do when you're at that point in your life.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nYou say there's three steps in that apprenticeship: deep observation. Is that what you mean? When you say deep observation, you mean being able to observe the job happening, or do you mean something else?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, it means that. It also means most people, when they start a job, their first impulse is, I've got to impress people. I've got to make them like me. That's that inward direction that's so deadly in seduction, and it's deadly in life. You want to be outer-directed. You want to observe the codes and conventions of your field, the social codes, what's acceptable behavior, what's not acceptable behavior, the skills involved, the various heuristics, the various things that you have to learn that create skill. You want to be a sponge absorbing what's going on around you. What are the things you need to learn? What are the valuable skills? What are the things that aren't valuable? Who are the people you need to avoid? Who are the people you need to emulate? You're a laser. You're just observing everything around you and not worried about yourself.\nThat's deep observation.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nYou talked about skill there. It's all well and good seeing skills and knowing which skills are important. Acquiring those skills is point number two when you're in that apprenticeship phase in life, skills acquisition. This kind of goes to what you were saying with working in a florist shop next to the entrepreneur. You're going to be hands-on. You're going to be doing, which also goes to what you said earlier about parents and children, putting them in situations where they get to do stuff. A lot of jobs don't offer that. A lot of jobs don't offer the difficulty, the challenge, right? How important is that?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, we call it learning by doing. You see, some things play into how the human brain operates. That's what you want. I give the image in the introduction to Mastery, the part in the alliteration here, but the brain has a grain to it. You want to work with that grain. You don't want to work against the grain because it's counterproductive. One of the grains of the brain, sorry, is learning by doing. Flashback 300,000 years ago, we're sitting there. We're making tools out of bones, out of wood, etc. The way the skill was passed on to other people and didn't die with one generation was you watched this person making the tool, then you watched them, and you learned, and you imitated them. Flash forward to the medieval period in Europe where they had apprenticeship schools. Seven years, you're learning masonry.\nYou're learning carpentry. You're learning whatever. For seven years, you're sitting there watching somebody make things, and you're doing it. That's how the brain operates. You learn by doing, not by thinking, not by thinking, oh, this is how things are fitted with mortars, etc., etc. No, I'm doing it with my hands. The brain and the hand have the most connection of any part of our body, because so much of our power as a species depended on our hands. We don't have much of that anymore. Learning by doing things with your hands or making things is how the brain is wired. You want to go with that grain. You want to do things. You want to make things. You want to be learning through action, not through just a lot of talk and.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nAs you might know, this show is now sponsored by Airbnb. I can't count how many times Airbnbs have saved me when I'm traveling around the world, whether it's recently when I went to the jungle in Bali or whether it's when I'm staying here in the UK or going to business in America. I can also think of so many times where I've stayed in a host's place on Airbnb, and I've been sat there wondering, could my place be an Airbnb as well? If it could be, how much could I earn? It turns out you could be sitting on an Airbnb gold mine without even knowing about it. Maybe you have a spare room in your house that friends stay from time to time. You could Airbnb that space and make a significant amount of money instead of letting it stay empty.\nThat in-law, that guest house, that annex where your parents sometimes stay, you could Airbnb that and make some extra income for yourself. Whether you could just use some extra money to cover some bills, or for something a little bit more fun, your home might be worth a little bit more than you think. You can find out the answer to that question by going to airbnb.co.uk/host. One of the things that you referenced at the start of this conversation, I think maybe even off camera, was in 2018, you had a stroke, and that changed your life in a very fundamental way. Can you tell me what happened and how it changed you?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, it was a terrifying experience. I was in a coma. I emerged from it, and suddenly, I was somebody who was very physical. Sports was a huge part of my life. I would swim very long distances. I love mountain biking. I was doing all kinds of hiking. It was extremely important to me. Every single day, I did something physical to take my mind off things. Suddenly, it's taken away from me. The left side of my body is basically paralyzed. I have no control over it. To this day, I still have problems with it. Can't swim. Can't mountain bike. Can't hike, right? I can't take my mind. I can't think while I'm taking a hike. I can't type for a writer. That's not much fun. I had to deal with crap that I've never had to deal with in my life.\nI had a pretty easy time compared to this. I had to learn new life skills when I'm already 62 years old. That isn't easy stuff. I don't want to whine or complain because people deal with worse stuff all the time. A lot of people get cancer, etc. Anybody who's had a stroke knows what I'm talking about. It's very hard because you can practice and practice and practice and practice hours and hours of therapy. I do over an hour of therapy every day, and you hardly notice any results. The frustration. It takes you 10 minutes to tie your shoes. You can't button your thing. You have to get other people to do that. It's hard to cut food. You have to be patient. You have to accept this.\nYou have to find another way of loving your life, of accepting these things that you took for granted before. I tell people, I look out my window now where I'm writing, and I see people walking their dog, and I put myself in their shoes, and I go, God, that must be so great just to walk your dog down the street. What a pleasurable thing. They don't realize it. You take it for granted now. Please don't take it for granted. Understand that the ability that you have now to run, to walk your dog, to swim, to type, it can be taken away from you. Just appreciate your life for what you have because the things that I love were taken away from me, and I wish they hadn't been. I've had to adjust myself.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhen something like that happens in life, when you are the victim of a tragedy or instance or circumstance or something that happens, there's often a degree of unfairness surrounding it. When I read about that incident in 2018, I read that it was a bee sting that caused the clot that caused the stroke.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nYeah, I know. It's actually, I think, a wasp. If that wasp had been moving, the wind had been a little different, and it had moved this way instead of this way, I may not have had a stroke. I can tell you this. In May of that year—the stroke was in August—in May, I'd finished The Laws of Human Nature, which took me five years. When I finished that book, I felt like I was near death. I was so exhausted. I was so drained. My wife was really worried about me because I just looked really haggard. Slowly, I kind of recovered. In July, I went to New York, and I forgot my blood pressure medication that I take. My blood pressure was starting to rise.\nI came back to LA, and I walked in this park, and the wasp stung me here. My whole chest turned red, and it was like the most unbearable feeling. I went to the hospital. They gave me this drug called prednisone to relieve the itching. Prednisone increases your blood pressure. When I ended up having the stroke, the blood clot, it was right where the wasp sting was. The neurologist said probably all this cholesterol was released from that wasp sting here, and that's where the blood clot occurred. There were all these other circumstances that kind of led to it, kind of a perfect storm. Maybe if I hadn't had that wasp sting, it would have happened four months later under different circumstances, and I would have died.\nWhat happened was I was driving my car when I got my stroke. My wife was in the other seat. She saw something really strange going on my face. I didn't notice it. She forced me to pull over to the side of the road. Ninety percent of the time, I'm alone. I'm swimming, I'm hiking, I'm driving. Could have happened four months from then. She wouldn't be there. I'd be dead right now. I can't really think in terms of, oh, if that wasp had been diverted. It would be a good feeling, but it's too painful for me to imagine. I like to think of, fortunately, someone was there who saved my life, because it could have very well happened four months from then because my body was worn down, and something much worse could have happened.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThat journey you described of having to rebuild, relearn, and redesign your life, we've talked about the topic of power so much in this conversation. In that moment, it sounds like your power to some degree had been taken from you.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nYou learn, at least for me, when I looked at people, I looked at people differently after my stroke. I had more empathy for them. I'm normally an empathetic person, but I was looking at people in the pandemic who got long COVID, who were having strokes, or were having terrible circumstances. When I look at people who were disabled, because I'm essentially disabled now, I understand them. Also, the other thing is when I look at people who are really poor, who are struggling in life, they feel really dependent and helpless. I felt that physically. I don't feel that materially because I don't have that problem anymore, thank God. I have more empathy. I understand it not in an intellectual way, but in a visceral, physical way, that sensation of, I don't know where my food's coming from.\nI don't know what's going to happen the next day. I'm weak, I'm dependent, I'm helpless. It's miserable. I kind of understood that feeling now on a different level, on a level that affected me personally. It's a lot different than having it affect you in an intellectual way.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nThe phases in that journey to where you are today, the first phase after the incident, you wake up, you realize that your life has changed. What's going on in your psychology? What's going on in your mind? You talked about helplessness and depression.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nTo be honest with you, what happened to me was right afterwards, there was a level of delusion in my mind. I kept thinking, well, in three months, I'll be back at it. In six months, I'll be swimming. In a year, I'll be hiking again. I deluded myself. I wasn't aware of how hard the process was. Six months, eight months, a year down the road, as I realized I was wrong, that's when the depression sat in. That's when it really started hitting me. I thought I'd be back. Here I am four years on. I thought I'd be back to my life, but I'm not. That's what was the hardest struggle, was actually a year in there and going, there's a phase where you kind of plateau, where you're not really progressing anymore. That's the worst part of it.\nI'm progressing now again because I have a great therapist. I had to deal with really bad depression about a year, a year and a half in when it started to realize, this is my life, man. I'm going to always have this funny arm that's bowing in. I'm going to be walking like this. I never expected this in my life. I've had to deal with that, and I've had to kind of find a way to not let it get me down, to find other pleasures and joys in life, etc., which I have.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nHow do you find a way to not let it get you down? I'm thinking now about people that are listening to this that might be struggling with their own subjective struggles in life. They've lost their job, they have a disability, whatever it might be. What are the successful strategies you've deployed to try and keep that peace of mind?\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, I don't know how much of it is applicable because I'm at a phase of life where I don't have material worries. I could have had a kind of stroke where my physical element would have been untouched, but my brain would have been damaged, which is another part. That would have been worse because I wouldn't have been able to write another book. I have a very active mind. For me, being able to write another book is my salvation. When it's 3:00PM in the afternoon when I get down to writing, it's the happiest moment in my life. I feel at peace. I'm back to my work, and I love my work, and I love what I'm writing about. It's saved me a lot. I do meditation. I've been meditating now for about 12 years, I think, more than that.\nEvery morning, it's a ritual. I have to meditate. If I don't, something's wrong. I've never missed a day, I can honestly say. It just calms me down. It just gives me strength throughout the whole day. I get up at 7:00AM. The sun's usually shining because it's Los Angeles. I go, it's the morning. I'm greeting the morning. I'm greeting the sun. It's like I'm somebody 4,000 years ago in a tribe. Here's the sun. It's a miracle that there's even something like that. The birds are chirping. I'm looking at the ivy. The sky is blue. I just calm myself down. Intrusive negative thoughts start popping into my mind. You didn't do this. You have a podcast today at 2:00PM, Robert. You got to do this, that, and the other. I get rid of them. I go, calm down. Put that away.\nGround yourself. It's helped immeasurably. The other thing is always keep in mind that there are people who have it worse than you. I don't want to feel sorry for—I don't like the sense of feeling sorry for myself. In fact, sometimes I turn it around, and I look at that person walking the dog or jogging, and I go, actually, I feel sorry for you because you're not aware of how precarious life is. You're not aware of how this could be taken away from you. You're not aware of how precious it is to just be alive and just to see the sky and the birds. I feel better than you in a way. I turn it around. I don't want to feel sorry for myself. The thing is there are people who have it worse.\nI read in the newspaper all the time, Cancer, or you're in Ukraine, or I was dealing a lot with people in Iran right now, what they're dealing with. I don't have to deal with that kind of crap, like being in Iran and dealing with that daily life. How horrifying. These are thoughts that take you out of the moment where you're feeling sorry for yourself, and you're kind of grateful for certain things. Those are some of the strategies I've had to kind of create for myself.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nI find it so—I find it so, I guess, powerful to hear those strategies because we all get caught up in our narrow perspective and our own subjective feelings that we're suffering or that life is against us, and that kind of torments us in many ways. As you've post-stroke in 2018, is there anything else that you have learned about the nature of happiness from that incident that you might not have known before that incident, that I might not fully understand now? The things I heard you talk about are the importance of a sense of purpose, how perspective and gratitude are central to our feelings of happiness. Is there any other observations you've had that—I am just saying this from my own selfish perspective because I want to know.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWell, first of all, I don't want to give the impression that I've solved everything because I'm a work in progress. I have moments where I get so frustrated, and it's almost like I have Tourette's syndrome. I can't—I'm still four years in, and my arm is still like this, and I still can't brush my teeth the way I want. I get very frustrated. I'm getting better, but it's still a work in progress. I don't want to give the impression that I've somehow mastered it because it has mastered me. I have a long way to go, but I'm getting a lot better, a lot better at it day to day. I don't know. I think I've kind of touched on everything, only in the sense of.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nWhat about connection? You talked about your wife.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nYes. She's helped me a lot. God bless her soul. She's had to take care of me. I was somebody who's always prided myself for being independent. That was another thing that was taken away from me. I was traveling around the world, doing book tours, going to book festivals, doing interviews, doing consulting in various different countries. I can still travel, but it requires a lot more. I lost my independence. I had to have somebody help me with food every single day. I need things being done for me. I feel terrible that she's been put in that position, but she's been very gracious about it, and she understands. She has a lot of empathy because she knows what I've lost. Having somebody in your life, if I were alone, I couldn't deal with it, man.\nI wouldn't have been able to deal with it. It just would have been too much for me. It would have been too depressing. That depression that sucks you after a year would have leveled me. I couldn't have made it. That's an incredibly important aspect. Just appreciating the little things in life that I just—it's a cliché, and I hate saying clichés, but I have that feeling almost every day where I'm looking at somebody going, man, that must be—I'm riding my bike, and I'm seeing somebody just sitting in a park, reading a book on a bench, and I'm going, God, that is so much fun just to be able to do that. I can't do that anymore, but I put myself in their body.\nThe little things in life that you take for granted are filled with so much happiness and joy that you're not thinking about. If that person sitting on a bench reading that book only realized what this person riding by thinks, maybe they wouldn't take it for granted. So many of those little things that you don't think about have incredible importance, at least to me, having lost them. I don't know if I'm—I wish I had something better, but.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nNo, I think that was.\n\nRobert Greene\n\nAuthor, The 48 Laws of Power\n\nI can only come from my own experience. I can't make it up.\n\nStephen Bartlett\n\nHost, The Diary of a CEO\n\nYour books tend to focus on the nature of the human condition, how we are as humans, for better or for worse. It was interesting because as you were talking over several topics, when you're talking about seduction and the 48 Laws of Power and Mastery, there's a part of me that started to feel a little bit—I don't know—feel the darkness that is innate within humans a bit too much, maybe, that we're a little bit too contrived, manipulative, and conniving."

Joining me today are co-CEOs Ted Sorrendos and Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Newman. Our interviewer this quarter is Jessica Reeve-Ehrlich. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, Jessica, I'm going to turn it over to you for your first question.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. Let's start with Ted and Greg. You've worked together for over 15 years, but this is your Q1 as co-CEOs. Are there any highlights you want to share?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, Jessica, as you pointed out, it's been our Q1 together as co-CEOs, but 15 years working together. In those 15 years, you build a lot of respect and trust in each other to help you get through some trying times. Not to let you down about there was no drama, but this was pretty much a business-as-usual quarter for us, having done this together for so long. Greg and I enjoy the same kind of trust, respect, and shorthand that I enjoyed with Reid for so many years.\nI know Greg did as well. It's not as eventful as folks might have thought, and it's really been incredibly and wonderfully professionally stimulating to have a co-CEO and to get to tackle big problems together. I think one of the things that we'll look back at Reid's incredible 25 years at Netflix, one of the great accomplishments, is facilitating this very, very smooth transition and succession.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGreat. You've recently reduced prices in 116 countries. Is this a more local approach similar to what you did in India in 2021, or is the impetus to enable a successful introduction of password-sharing and advertising tiers?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI can take this one if you want. Jessica, this is really about we talked the last few quarters about further refining our pricing strategy and monetization. If you think back to when we did our global launch in 2016, it was pretty much across the board, a bit of a SCIM approach and not particularly sophisticated in terms of our pricing. Think of this as kind of that next step in our evolution of a bit of a better market fit, product market fit, pricing fit, with the aim of growing our penetration in these markets and also better medium and long-term revenue. Better for our members, better for our business.\nI want to emphasize this is not a material to our business anytime in the near term, for sure. It's a lot of countries, but it represents less than 5% of our revenue. It's something that, over the long term, hopefully will benefit us. We can point to an example of success is sort of like what we saw in India. Last year, back in 21 December , we dropped prices in India between 20% to 60%. We saw engagement over the past year grow by about 30%, high growth in paid net ads. Also, revenue, FX-neutral revenue growth actually accelerated from 19% in the year prior to 24% last year.\nWe're not saying every market's going to play out like that, but that's what it would look like in success.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGreat. Let's move on to password sharing. What have you seen in your Q1 new market launches, churn as well as conversion? Can you give us any specific color on what you've seen in Canada, whether it's in terms of new subs versus add-ons?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I'll take that one. This is an important transition for us. We're working hard to make sure that we do it well and as thoughtfully as we can. This last set of country rollouts have gone well. Maybe most importantly, we're directionally consistent with what we saw in Latin America. Just to remind people what that looks like, very much like a price increase, we see an initial cancel reaction, and then we build out of that both in terms of membership and revenue as borrowers sign up for their own Netflix accounts and existing members purchase that extra member facility for folks that they want to share with.\nFirst of all, it was a strong validation to see consistent results in these new countries because they're different market characteristics, different from each other, and also different from the original Latin American rollout countries. To get to a positive outcome, you mentioned Canada. We're now in a positive member and positive revenue position relative to pre-rollout. That's a really strong confirmation that we've got an approach that we can apply in many different countries with different market characteristics, including our largest revenue countries. In fact, we could have launched that solution. We actually considered that option.\nWe also learned from this last set of launches about some improvements we can do, especially in areas that matter a lot to our members, things like having seamless access to Netflix as they've always been using it on the go or while traveling, as well as making sure that we've got good tools for them to manage access to their accounts and their devices. All in, we felt based on those results, it was better to take a little bit of extra time, incorporate those learnings, and make this transition as smooth as possible as we can for members. We think that approach also best serves the long-term business goals as well.\nWe're going to launch this new improved version broadly, including in the United States in Q2.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nAs a follow-up, so the cadence, you just said the US is Q2. How about the rest of the world? Can you give us your thoughts on pricing and whether you have a preference for a current borrower to become a subscriber or an add-on?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. That launch we're doing in Q2 is a very broad launch. It includes the United States, includes many, many other countries. I mean, we reserve the right for some countries where we think there's a different approach. I would say the bulk of our countries, and certainly when you think about it from a revenue perspective, the vast majority will be rolling out in Q2. You mentioned in terms of pricing, we'll look at that on a market-by-market basis, but obviously, we tested different pricing in these last rollouts than what we tested in Latin America. That gives you a sense about how we're thinking about what is optimal pricing, especially in more affluent countries.\nI'll leave it at that. Then in terms of preference, what we're trying to do is create a structure that really supports choice.\nThat gives an opportunity for folks to spin off to borrower accounts where they think that's the right solution for them, or for use cases, which are legitimate use cases where somebody wants to basically buy Netflix for a family member or something like that. We want that extra member to be in place too. We don't really have, I'd say, a strong preference. We're not trying to steer in one perspective other than using pricing to both satisfy those customer choice goals as well as thinking about long-term revenue optimization.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nOne more on password sharing. Are there any incremental costs? It seems like content, distribution, marketing are already in your expenses. Is the incremental margin 100%, or are there plans to reinvest some of this revenue so it doesn't all flow through?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, I'll leave it to—go ahead. Take a second.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGo for it, Greg.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo, you got it. You got it. You got it.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI'd say there's really not, other than just kind of just the general kind of allocation of resources, I wouldn't say there's real incremental costs to this. Of course, we always want to reinvest. As you kind of see with our kind of guidance and our objectives generally, Jessica, we're looking to re-accelerate our revenue growth. That's the path that we're on right now. As we do that, we want to kind of balance gradually increasing margins. You see that in our guide where we're looking to tick up margins a bit to the 18 to 20% range full year relative to just under 18% last year, but balance that with that big prize ahead of us.\nReinvesting to more and more great entertainment for our members and drive that flywheel of more entertainment, more value for members, and ultimately more and more members over time, and then build a really, really big and profitable business.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nLet's move on to advertising. Netflix appears to have a huge advantage in what's called television advertising. I mean, you pretty much have nothing to lose from a legacy perspective and everything to gain on an AVI platform. Given the limited ad load, premium video content, your humongous reach and engagement with some pretty hard-to-reach demographics, as well as the ongoing mass transition from linear to streaming, your position is enviable. Having said that, you seem to be very careful in your advertising rollout. Can you give us your key learnings to date and what the growing pains have been so far?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. As you state, we're significantly optimistic about the long-term opportunity for the reasons that you mentioned. We've always expected, and we continue to expect, frankly, this to be a gradual build. It follows a very similar process that we've used in so many other areas where we get in, we learn as we go, we iterate. We found that having that approach yields basically great long-term outcomes as we sort of grow and learn. I would say where we're at today, we've got a lot of work to do to continue to develop features that support advertisers.\nWe're rolling out things like measurement and verification, but we've got a bigger, longer roadmap that we have to go do there. We're improving our go-to-market and sales capabilities in partnership with Microsoft. There's a lot of good work that we have to go do. Some of this is hard work because it's very country-by-country. You've seen us add programmatic private marketplace that gives advertisers more ways to buy as we grow inventory. Then we're also trying to improve things on the consumer-facing side. We're adding more features to the ads plan. We're making that experience better for members.\nThrough that sort of process, we expect those iterations, which we're trying to go as fast as we can on them while being judicious and thoughtful about the business, to really add up over a period of time into a significant, highly material and highly lucrative, high-margin business. There's plenty to go do, and we're trying to maintain a fast pace, but also a thoughtful pace.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGiven a lot of press reports regarding your buildup of ad tech capabilities, can you provide an overview of plans, timeframe, and cost?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would say we have ambition to be innovative in this space. A lot of that innovation is thinking about not a one-size-fits-all in terms of the member experience and thinking about what's the right time to fly an ad, things like that. I would also say that we're very much in the mode right now where we're doing a lot of work that is following a well-trodden path to build a big business. Back to when you think about verification, measurement, etc., what we're doing on programmatic, those are sort of, I'd say, relatively straightforward things. A lot of the work that we're doing is really heavily in that space. Then in terms of incremental costs, Spencer, do you want to chime in here?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. I'd say just generally, Jessica, we try to, in all of this, firstly, we've talked about this crawl walk around, which Greg mentioned, being very thoughtful and methodical how we're building the business, and with that also, how it impacts our overall financials, our revenue, and our incremental profit contribution. We believe we can do that in a very healthy way. That's what we're building towards. Yes, there is some cost to this, both in terms of the cost to the Microsoft partnership and the cost to kind of some building out of our capabilities, people, as well as tech capabilities, but all very manageable.\nWe also talked about a little bit of content costs as we continue to kind of—we increased our level of content parity on the plan this past quarter, which is great. It's about 95%+ of viewing parity, which is, again, a great progress. We keep moving forward, but this is all at a level that we believe is not just better for our members with a lower-priced option, but better for our business. We think we could do it and are doing it in a way that's, I would say, without being overly specific, think of it as like 50% or more incremental profit contribution to the business.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nWhen you come to the NET advertising upfront, which is in a couple of weeks, it sounds like you're coming with the standard tier now. Do you have any plans to introduce it to your premium tier? How much scale, meaning how many subs you expect on the platform when you roll out? When the upfront commitments come in the fall, how much scale will you have?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. On your first question, we're always thinking about and working to improve that plan structure, the pricing. We've got two goals in mind when we do that. One is we want to give a wide range of consumers and ideally increasingly wide range of consumers access to our great stories at a range of prices with appropriate corresponding features. The second goal is thinking about optimizing long-term revenue. A good example of this is based on the economics of our ads plan, based on the limited switching behavior that we've seen off of standard and premium.\nWe've upgraded the ads plan features, both in terms of video resolution or video quality and number of concurrent streams because we think it supports both of those goals. That's a good example of that. I would say beyond that, we've got—we'll continue to evaluate as we always do. You've seen us make moves in the space before, but we've got nothing more to add on that today. Then in terms of scale, obviously, we're growing. Every day we grow, and we're seeking to continue to grow, but we're not going to sort of announce or target or what we expect a forecast, let's say, for upfronts at this point.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nOne more advertising question, and then I'll move on. Can you provide our post-specifics on what you've seen so far? Because you mentioned in the release that the revenue is actually higher than even standard. It seems like so far, so good.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I can jump in. I mean, yes, overall, we're pleased with our kind of per-member ad plan economics. It's higher than our basic plan overall. As you say, in the US, it's actually even higher than our standard plan. We really like the path we're on, the trajectory we have. As I said, it's kind of a win-win because it's a lower-priced option for our members. It's both kind of incremental revenue, incremental profit for the business. It makes the business stronger, which, of course, we can then reinvest into more and more great entertainment. We like the path. Again, it's early.\nWe're only a couple of quarters into this, Jessica. We're going to get better, as Greg said, better targeting and measurement, better kind of tools and buying options for advertisers. We think all of that will actually kind of build on this so that we'll reinforce and strengthen that kind of premium CPM ad network that we're building.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nMaybe switching gears a little bit to the capital returns and free cash flow. You did raise your free cash flow guidance, but you kept your margins the same for this year. What are your longer-term margin growth or expectations at this point? Pre-COVID, you had indicated 300 basis points of improvement per year over a few-year period. Can you provide any updates to that?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWe've never provided a long-term guide to our margins, but I'd say we're already in a place where we feel great about the business that we have. It's a great business model, a business at scale with over 30 billion of revenue, healthy profit margins, growing margins, growing free cash flow. That's sort of the starting point. As I mentioned before, we're trying to balance as we re-accelerate revenue, ticking up those margins with also reinvesting back into the business, back into that member base, back into that big prize where we feel like we're so small today.\nWe've talked on recent earnings calls where we represent, we believe, roughly 5% of that direct consumer spend in the areas of entertainment that we're participating in today, primarily in film, TV, and games. When we think about even just the member population that's available, those 1 billion-plus broadband households, and even today, roughly 450, 500 million of those being connected TV households. We only have 230 million-ish paying members today, roughly, right? That's why we're so focused on addressing with paid sharing and then just making our business and the value that we bring to the service better each day to bring in more members. That's really what we're working towards.\nThen long-term, we don't see ourselves approaching a near-term ceiling. There's lots of proxies out there. Entertainment services and networks at scale traditionally have been well above our roughly 20% operating margin. We believe we have a long way to go, and we have some inherent advantages. We're a truly global entertainment network, perhaps the first, with really healthy leading engagement and a really scalable content model. We believe we've got a long way to go, but not really putting more specific guidance out for now.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nJust Spencer, if I could add an example of that, of the scale of the business being global, is that every one of our big content wins start as a local win. Then in success, they roll out, and they get regional, then they reach that espoir, then they get global, and it's huge success. There's no marginal cost to all that additional audience when we get it right. By creating those stories that drive growth of the business in local territories, it provides content into the pool that people can fall in love with, and it's just as likely that we can get a gigantic hit from anywhere in the world. That's really the scale of our operating business.\nTo go back to what Spencer said about the potential to even grow margins beyond where we're at today is very, very high.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nCan you give us an update on your capital return plans? I mean, how are you thinking about you announced the 1.2 million buyback in Q1, but relative to your free cash flow and incredible balance sheet, you have a lot of capacity. Can you give us any color on how you're thinking about capital returns over the longer term?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. Spencer, do you want to take that one?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I can take that one. Thanks, Jessica, for the question. We are happy to be fully investment-grade as of Q1. That's a nice milestone for the company. You're right, there's no change to our capital allocation philosophy. We are still targeting to maintain minimum cash equivalent to roughly two months of revenue. Based on the Q1 numbers, it's about $5.4 billion of minimum cash. We ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion on the balance sheet. We do have about $2.4 billion of excess cash. That is why we did indicate in the letter that our share repurchases will accelerate over the course of the year.\nThen one other minor thing I forgot to mention in my intro is that this video interview will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. I do want to say that. Here's evidence that this video interview is actually not scripted. Back to you, Jessica.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. Ted, how are you preparing for a potential writer strike? Potential is not likely.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, Jessica, let's first say we respect the writers, and we respect the WGA, and we couldn't be here without them. We don't want to strike. The last time there was a strike, it was devastating to creators. It was really hard in the industry. It was painful for local economies that support production. It was very, very, very bad for fans. If there's a strike, and we want to work really hard to make sure we can find a fair and equitable deal so we can avoid one. If there is one, we have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world, so we could probably serve our members better than most.\nWe really don't want this to happen, but we have to make plans for the worst. We do have a pretty robust slate of releases to take us into a long time. Just be clear, we're at the table, and we're going to try to get to an equitable solution so there isn't a strike.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nBeyond the strike, just once you get that, we get past that, how do you expect content spending to change over the next few years? You've kind of been at this $17 billion cadence. Does it depend on revenue growth? Can you give us some color on how you're thinking about that?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, yes, it depends on revenue growth. Also keep in mind that the way that revenue or the way that content spend hits us is with startup productions and deliveries. We still work through, or we came through, or comping off of those post-COVID floodgates opening. That does makes the content spend a little lumpier. We expect to be back to about the $17 billion level in 2024. The rate of growth depends on the rate of revenue growth, for sure.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nDo you have any?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nJust to add to Ted's point, because I totally agree with all of that. Again, there's a big opportunity ahead. I just want to reinforce that. We said we'd stay at roughly $17 billion on average over a few-year period, over that 2022 to 2024 period. There's a big entertainment market to go after beyond that. As we re-accelerate revenue, we see a lot of opportunity to grow into that viewing and engagement and business opportunity ahead. We expect to be there, and we just have to build into it. Absolutely.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nDo you have any thoughts on revisiting your film strategy in terms of theatrical output as well as distribution? You've had so much success at the Academy Awards. Does that change anything for you? You also recently had a restructuring in this division. Is there anything to read from that?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo, Jessica. The film division is doing great. They really are building some great films. As you point out, the success at the Oscars was great. The thing even better than that was the movies that won so big were also very, very popular with fans. This is award-winning, critical acclaim, and enormously popular with fans. Like I said, with Aqua and the Western Front was that. Pinocchio certainly was that. We're really proud of the films that were in the mix because they were loved by fans.\nWe're really happy with the investment in film. Of course, we're trying to improve it like we do with all of our films. Our release strategy, remember, there's a lot of ways to create and collect demand for a film. Driving folks to a theater is just not our business. We create that demand, and we collect that demand on our subscription service with our members. I think having big, new, desirable content, including feature films in the first window, drives value for our members and drives value to the business. No major changes in play except for trying to continue to improve the films for our members and make a big splash with films that are loved and watched.\nIt's really leaning into an advantage. We believe in advantage we have of delivering that value to our members. Because of our reach and our scale to have over 230 million paying members at our average revenue per member, it affords the opportunity to invest in these big movies, bring them to our members. It's just one other piece or area of variety of content and must-watch content and entertainment for our members. It's really kind of leaning into that advantage. I think it's tempting to make the comparison between the services, but the other services don't have that scale, as you pointed out, Spencer.\nThey don't have the revenue base or the viewer base to support with a single window the way we can support even big-budget films with a single window on Netflix.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nHow is your live strategy evolving? Chris Brock was a huge hit, but Love Is Blind had some technical issues. Is live a big advertising driver? Do you need to invest more to beef up your technical capabilities?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nGreg, do you want to grab that?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I'll kick it off. I would start by saying we're really sorry to have disappointed so many people. We didn't meet the standard that we expect of ourselves to serve our members. Just to be clear from a technical perspective, we've got the infrastructure. We had just a bug that we introduced actually when we implemented some changes to try and improve live streaming performance after the last live broadcast, Chris Rock in March. We just didn't see this bug in internal testing because it only became apparent once we put sort of multiple systems interacting with each other under the load of millions of people trying to watch Love Is Blind.\nWe hate it when these things happen, but we'll learn from it, and we'll get better. We do have the fundamental infrastructure that we need. I would say the good news is that ultimately, 6.5 million viewers watched and enjoyed the show. Then I'll turn it over to Ted to talk about more of the strategy side.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, look, as we've said, we want to use live when it makes sense creatively, when it helps the content itself. A reunion show that's going to generate news and buzz, it really does play better live when people can enjoy it together. Certainly, the Chris Rock stand-up show played out so well because there's so much anticipation for what he's going to say in that set. When we have the opportunities to do projects like that, we like the fact that we have the option to do it. As Greg said, we were super disappointed to not be able to come across with the live product for everyone who wanted it on Love Is Blind reunion. We're super thrilled that people love the show.\nIt does point to the kind of love for that brand and for the growing love for those unscripted brands on Netflix. Some of them will be live. I do think sometimes those results-oriented shows do play out a little bit better on live, and they do generate a lot of conversation. Keep in mind, like on Chris Rock, about 90% of the viewing happened after. It doesn't change the fact that it was a big event when it happened live.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nIs it a big driver of advertising?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe are not currently.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo, go ahead, Ted. You take it.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI was going to say we're not currently have advertising in the live broadcast.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nRight. I have one more question on password sharing. Just go back to that for a second. Of the 30 million you can and 100+ million global borrowers, that sounds like from your release, that's actually the number of households. What is the number of potential subs or add-ons? I mean, what is the potential conversion from these 100+ million households?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, to some degree, I mean, the borrowers that represent well-qualified people in the sense that they have all the technical needs to get to Netflix. There's a smart TV, the broadband access. They know how the system works. They've clearly enjoyed content on the service before. Having said that, we see sort of a range of engagement amongst those borrowers. Some folks are watching as much of our shows as a normal paying account. Those folks are very strong likelihood to convert, I would say. Then we see that tailor off, taper off, rather, through that range of folks. If you're watching much less, it's much less likely that you'll ultimately convert.\nEven in that case, I'd say this represents a really important structural shift where we'll develop that one-to-one relationship without pricing distortion, without membership distortion, with a whole new range of members. We'll see membership grow through that approach. We'll see revenue grow through it as well. We'll also see a situation where in high viewer penetration markets like the United States, you mentioned the stats there, some of those folks won't convert, but they'll represent essentially a pool of people that we can then go after with improving our offering, more amazing movies.\nTed talked about that, more amazing series, more amazing games in the fullness of time. That'll get those folks ultimately to convert over members as well.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThen just also going back to advertising, what are the advertising features that you are most excited about?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, again, we're sort of in this mode where there's what I'm super excited about, and then there's the work that we really need to do for the business, which I'm also excited with it because it's just about how we get to be bigger. There's sort of the brass tacks pieces, which are a lot about measurement, verification, targeting, expanding the ways for advertisers to buy. I'm excited from a sort of immediacy of business returns for those pieces. Then when you think about from a technology and product experience perspective, what am I excited about there?\nThat's, again, where I think we have an opportunity to bring the specific characteristics of a premium, fully addressable, fully targetable, fully deterministic ad streaming system to this world. That means that we can do a whole range of things in terms of how we flight creatives from brands associated with certain shows. It thinks about how we tailor the user experience to be specific to what the user needs in a moment, rather than having a one-size-fits-all set of rules in terms of how we flight ads.\nThere's just a whole amazing line of innovation that we can go after. We'll be going after it, frankly, for years. We don't even know what all those things are because mostly we'll be working with advertisers and members to try things and then let them tell us what's working and what's not.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nWhat do you consider the walk phase?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, I think we're sort of getting into the walk phase, and it's probably a combination of things. One is scale. Obviously, scale is relevant in the business. We're getting to a certain size of scale that shifts how advertisers think about us. Part of it is the technical features that advertisers that face advertisers. That's very much along the lines of that's measurement, verification, targeting, the programmatic buying capability. That's a component of it. Those, I think, really constitute. I'd characterize that we're basically getting into that middle phase of growth. We've got a lot of work, frankly, to do in that before we get to the run phase.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we talked about it's a multi-year build and a gradual build and crawl, walk, run. We're only a couple of quarters into this. I don't know, Greg, if you would agree, but I would hope we're in the walk phase by the end of the year and into next year. I think this is a year of getting from crawl to walk.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, that sounds right.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nI just wanted to clarify something, Spencer. I think you said there's a 50% margin. I mean, typically, advertising could be as high as 80 or 85% margins. Do you expect to build up to that, or do you think it's really just a 50%+ business?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, I put plus in there. I said at least 50%. It was really just to highlight the fact that we're still in startup mode of this business. Leaning a little conservative. Yes, our expectations over time is that it'd be meaningfully over 50%, but I don't want to give a specific number yet.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nOkay. Moving on to gaming. Can you give us some data points on engagement and what you're seeing on retention?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I'm not going to give you those specific points, but let me just review sort of where we're at more broadly. We've got 55 games out to date. We've got 40 more in the queue for this year. There's very exciting games. If you want to try a few out, I'd recommend Terra Nil. That's a reverse city builder, so a sort of twist on that genre. You've got Mighty Quest launching today. Our first new game from an internal studio, which is Oxenfree II, is coming later this year. You can sort of see us build into a combination of licensing and now layering in internally developed games into that.\nIt's following a trajectory that we've seen before, I would say, on these other new content categories that we've added. If you think about film, and you heard folks here talk about sort of that film progress or nonfiction or international, where we sort of build into this over a multi-year period. To reinforce, you mentioned those metrics. I mean, the fundamental goal here, obviously, is to give our members a new entertainment modality and more ways to enjoy incredible universes and deepen their fandom.\nWe do that with an effort to drive the primary metrics we have on the consumer-facing side, which is engagement with the service, which leads to retention and incredible stories that people are talking about, games that are must-play games that create buzz off the service and motivate people to sign up.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nAre there plans to directly monetize games, for example, advertising or licensing IP to game developers?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNot currently. We think that very consistent with what we've done in other parts of the business. The best thing for us to do is really focus on the core initiative, which for us right now is how do we bring games and games based on our IP to our members, to fans of that IP directly. Also, we believe that we want to have a differentiated gaming experience. Part of that is giving game creators the ability to think about building games purely from the perspective of player enjoyment and not having to worry about other forms of monetization, whether it be ads or in-game payment.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nMaybe turning to India, which is one of the biggest global markets and one of the fastest-growing markets really in the world right now. Spencer, you mentioned the pricing change in '21. Ted, you recently said at a panel earlier in the year, I think you were in India, that it is your fastest-growing market. You've given the statistics engagement of 30%, revenue of 24%. I think, Ted, you said that you're increasing your local originals from 28 last year. Can you just talk a little bit about this market? What are your longer-term plans? Is it actually profitable, or is this something where we can see a real change in contribution?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nLook, I think what we've talked about earlier, when we get the pricing a little better, more suited to the market, you can see that we can grow revenue and therefore we grow engagement. We have to get the content that people just really flip out for. We've seen a steady improvement in that quarter-over-quarter, both in our films and our series. Rana Nadu now is a great show that we just the people are loving all over the country. It causes a great deal of excitement for the service. Now, again, we have to get the pricing and the payment methods right. India is a big prize because it's in an enormous population of entertainment-loving people.\nYou just have got to have the product that they love and a product that you can do business with them together. We're doing the creative part, and we're getting the pricing better. There's always lots of promise to continue to grow in India. It is a very specific market in terms of they like local content. Also, you're seeing their local content is traveling more than ever. This was an incredible year, I think, is what you may be referring to, Jessica, that I was talking about movies like RRR, which did business all over the world. Gangubai was this really fantastic film that was in the hunt for best foreign language feature.\nYou look at all these things and say that as the content opportunity continues to scale and our ability to access the market and thrill those audiences continues to grow, we could do quite well in India. We're a long ways from that. We're still investing against it. I think that we'll ultimately do great in India. Jessica, we have time for two last questions, please.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nOkay. Moving on to ancillary revenue and products. Can you give us an outlook or an update on just what you're seeing, what your expectations are for consumer products? I mean, you announced the Lacoste collaboration for clothing on your eight most iconic shows, but you also have other collaborations. I know it just seems like an area that now that you're building up your own content seems to provide a huge incremental opportunity.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we continue to grow it. The primary driver for our consumer product business is to build and deepen fandom. It does drive some revenue. In general, what we're really looking for is those opportunities to help fans connect with their favorite shows, their favorite films, their favorite talent by wearing the shirt or carrying the notebook and other ways that people really like to express their fandom. Also through these very successful live experiences, the Bridgerton experience or the Stranger Things experiences that travel around the world. We're super excited about all of them.\nYou see us stepping into even a newer one with the Stranger Things stage show. There's all kinds of amazing stuff coming in that world. Keep in mind that it's mostly to build fandom in a way that can drive revenue, but mostly it strengthens the core of the business.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGreat. I guess one last one. Just a follow-up on password sharing. In the markets where you've rolled out password sharing, have you seen any movement between the tiers? For example, a household that has a premium subscription, are they going to two standard or anything like that?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we see some of those effects, right? We know that in especially price-sensitive markets, right? This is also a situation which is very different market by market. In some price-sensitive markets, consumers essentially got to a practical or informal pricing structure by subscribing to premium and then sharing this out and then oftentimes actually having people pay for a fraction of that as they're sharing it.\nAssociated with that, we see some of that being shifted off of those plans and having those people sign up for individual plans as we rationalize that structure, implement the changes that prevent password sharing, and also have them be able to use things like extra member or in countries where it's relevant, the ads plan as a new entry-level price. I think you're going to see some of that sorting. Again, we think this really it's better for the business.\nUltimately, it sets us up structurally to have more members, to have a one-to-one relationship with those members, to have all the systems that we have work more correctly, to have more transparent sort of pricing connections with those different members on the different plans. We're excited about getting to that point. Again, I would characterize this as a very country-specific kind of approach where some countries respond that way and other countries really wasn't about that. It was much more about casual sharing.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nJust so I could just add really quick, the way that we went over those sharers and the way that we grow the ads plan is to have the content that people cannot live without. Let me just tell you real quick before we get into the close here how we're doing on that front. Because this quarter alone, this past Q1, Night Agent became our sixth biggest original season of television in our history. Incredible success. We saw returning seasons of You for season four, a third season of Outer Banks, a second season of Ginny and Georgia, all shows that have grown from their original first seasons.\nAlso shows that have created incredible new stars like Chase Stokes and Antonia Gentry and Madelyn Cline, and Penn Badgley, who now have huge fan bases around the world. We saw The Glory, which is from Korea, and our fourth biggest non-English launch ever. We had incredible big films with big stars like You People, Your Place or Mine, Murder Mystery 2. Did really well in the multi-cam comedy space with The 90 Show and in Unscripted with Full Swing. This past quarter, we are super thrilled with the results of the content. We have to keep that up in order to win over those sharing accounts and also to grow that ad-supported tier.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nSenior US Media and Entertainment Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nYou missed beef. You didn't say that. That was just incredible.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nOh, I missed a bunch. Jessica, the reason why when we talk about our content, it sometimes sounds like a laundry list, is it's a long list that really illustrates how hard this is to do. It's just to hit on the quality and the breadth of the entertainment that people really want. Everyone has such remarkably varied tastes that you have to have different things for different fans. That's what we're good at doing at scale.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nPlus one to beef as being an amazing title.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, by the way, that's new this quarter, and it has kicked off, and it's off to a tremendous start. It's, again, another example of critical acclaim, likely to do well award season, we hope, but loved by fans.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. With that said, did you want to take us home?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I just want to tell you real quick, we're really pleased with the quarter. 2023 is off to a good start. Netflix is the leading streaming service in terms of engagement, revenue, and profits, and streaming is the future of entertainment at home. On engagement, just yesterday, Nielsen released data that in Q1 to 2023, Netflix was the most watched of any broadcaster or streamer in the US by a pretty nice margin. We have plenty of room to grow. Even with that tremendous amount of watching, we're about 10% of total TV time in our most established markets like the US and the UK.\nOn revenue and profit, we're growing. Not as fast as we believe we can, not as fast as we want to, but we are growing, and we are profitable. We have a clear path to re-accelerate growth in both revenue and profit, and we're executing on it. You'll see a broader rollout of paid sharing in Q2, and we're going to continue to grow that ad business. We also are aiming to continue to grow free cash flow. As we said, this year, we're going to generate about 3.5 billion in free cash and on increased margins. Remember that this account sharing initiative helps us have a larger base of potential paying members that we can continue to serve and grow Netflix long-term.\nThat's why we've been so focused on execution. The variety and quality of our much-watched movies, our much-watched TV shows, our must-play games, we're going to keep working to improve discovery, to have buzzier and more creative marketing. Because when we deliver for our members, we deliver as a business. We keep doing that by doing it just a bit better and a bit faster than our competition every month, every quarter, and every year. Thanks, Jessica.",

Joining me today are Executive Chairman Reed Hastings, Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, Jessica, over to you for your first question.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, and thank you so much for having me today. Reed, the big announcement about the management changes. Can you give us some more color on the process and how you came to this decision?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix\n\nJessica, it feels like yesterday was our IPO. We were covered in red envelopes. We IPO'd at about $1. Hopefully, some of you have held the stock the full 21 years. When I think of the evolution, the three of us and so many other incredible Netflix employees, to go from DVD service to streaming leader in films, television, and emerging player in games, and now to have over 230 million members, it's just, Jim Collins probably said it best. He called it a good start. We've had a good start. Honestly, we dream of the whole world finding their favorite entertainment on Netflix, and we shorthand that as entertain the world.\nThe three of us have been working together for 15 years now, trying to figure out how do we get through this issue, that issue, how do we grow, and I couldn't be happier to complete our succession process. It really started about 10 years ago with the board, trying to think through how could this work. They both have such amazing talents and gifts, and to find a platform where they've been able to contribute is fantastic.\nAbout two and a half years ago, we took a partial step. Ted is Co-CEO, Greg is COO. We continued to just make super progress, and frankly, more and more they've been leading the company, and this is acknowledging really in formal terms how we've been operating for at least the last few quarters. It's just a great feeling.\nWhen I think about the stock appreciation over the last decade, I know that they want to beat that record, and I'm all for that. I'll be Executive Chairman, helping them everywhere I can, but it's really theirs to lead and to do that energy, hustle, and intensity that we've been doing. They're very ready. That's what's driving the timing, and I could not be happier. Back over to you.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Subjectively, I'll just add that this may be the smoothest transition we've seen in media for quite a while. Now, for Ted and Greg, what does this mean for Netflix? Does this signal a change in strategy or approach?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nJessica, let me start with, first and foremost, to thank Reed personally and professionally. He has been, and I trust will continue to be, a role model, a mentor, a friend. In 22+ years, Reed has positively changed my life in every way imaginable. He leaves some big shoes for Greg and I to fill. Fortunately, we have four feet to do it with, so that's a good thing.\nIn so many ways, the way that Reed's been able to see around corners. That's why he's been thinking about the succession for the last decade. He generously opened up more of a co-leadership model over a decade ago for he and I, and, like you said, two and a half years ago, made it a little more formal. In that time, delegating a lot of the day-to-day to Greg and I.\nIn that time, in those two and a half years we've been working together, we've been working together for 15 years, Greg and I. In the last two and a half years, particularly, we've been able to build a really trusting, respectful, and complementary partnership, in many ways the same way I have with Reed over the years. I really do believe that this kind of shared leadership model is going to help us to move fast and to challenge each other, to challenge the company, to raise to new heights. I'm just incredible at what we're able to do.\nTo your point, this is the leadership team. It's been pretty stable, and that's why this steady transition feels so steady. The stability of this team has helped us build a great foundation and a culture that can absorb complexity and change. As you saw in this last quarter, can rise to any occasion. Greg, I just want to say I'm thrilled to be in this with you, and Reed, we can't thank you enough.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks, Ted. It's a real honor to be asked to take on this responsibility and join you as Co-CEO, and frankly, a pleasure to be able to continue working with some of the most amazing leaders that I've ever had the pleasure of working with, and, frankly, in my opinion, the best leadership team that Netflix has ever had.\nI'll just echo Ted's comments. It's been a real fun and rewarding experience to work closely with him over the last couple of years, especially, and I'm tremendously proud of the partnership that we've developed in the shorthand, and really how we have been able to take what are sort of a complementary set of skills and perspectives and seeing different angles to different situations.\nBasically, at the end of the day, we have always found or are ultimately motivated by the same things, which is that we want to serve our members, and we want to grow our business, and that is an incredible and powerful aligning process to those different perspectives. I'm proud of the work that we've done over 2022 in the latter half, especially to get some more momentum into the business, but I'm even more excited about continuing to push that into 2023 and follow, the model that Reed has always had of continually seeking excellence and always striving to be better. Looking forward to that.\nTo your specific question, Jessica, there's no big strategy shift or big culture shifts. Ted, Reed, and I have been working and sort of grinding through our individual perspectives on this for a long time. Really, we look forward to taking things forward as we have been for the last little bit and responding to a dynamic industry and doing the changes that we think are appropriate. We don't have a bank of changes that we've been holding for this moment. Mostly it's continuity and move forward.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. This was originally for Reed, but now given the change in leadership structure, maybe for all three of you, for Reed, Ted, and Greg. One of the best quotes recently was from John Malone, who said shareholders should build a monument for Reed Hastings. John and Rupert Murdoch ran the dominant global media companies in prior decades and were one of the few media executives who've been able to see around corners. Ultimately, they both sold the bulk of their assets. Netflix is now one of the most dominant global media companies, if not the dominant. What is your view of the next 5+ years? Do you need to get bigger, stay the course?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThe one thing I'd point out is that what's happening now and what's going to be happening over the next couple of years is that the consumer is moving to streaming. The way that they watch content at home, delivered to them on the internet, on demand, free of the linear schedule and all those things, that is a change, a fundamental shift in the business, and you've got to be where the consumer is. That's what we've been focused on since we started streaming, doing original content 10 years ago, but really realizing that we've we've really benefited from being a customer-first company and meeting the customers where they are.\nWe've also had this blessing of not having to unwind our traditional media business as we built into this one. We've always been focused on the future and where the consumers are going, and I think our ability to continue to stay focused on that because, I know we've been talking about it for a long time, Jessica, but this is really at its infancy. You think about as big as we've become and all these things that are happening, and in the US, we're about 8% of TV time still.\nIt's an enormous amount of growth ahead, even in markets where we are very well established. That's the key for us, and I think being able to focus on consumers first has really been our biggest benefit. I think it's what led us to those milestones that you just referred to. Greg?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, Jessica, I would say I think that that translates into being bigger, and I think that means being bigger in terms of touching more members around the world, delivering them incredible entertainment. We'll see that in terms of being bigger in terms of the amount of engagement that we can drive, the amount of hours that we're satisfying them.\nIt'd be bigger in terms of the culture impact. You've seen just incredible cultural impact in terms of Wednesday, Stranger Things, the ramifications that these shows have in terms of the popular culture are significant, and that's going to get bigger too. It also means bigger in terms of revenue and profit streams. We're looking forward to those as well.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. Losing subs in 2022 and the market reaction or valuation reset is akin to August 2015 when Bob Iger called out the early decline of pay-TV subs and the impact for Disney's ESPN. It will take a while for Disney to build ESPN+ into a sports streaming giant, and actually, they may never replace the profitability of ESPN at that point in time. Your pivot seems more broad-based by extending genres and going to new areas, whether it's games, fitness, live, et cetera. Do you see any similarities or differences to that momentous inflection point which has certainly shifted Wall Street's view from subs to profits?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI'll take a shot at that, and then Ted, maybe weigh in. I think it's a fundamentally different situation. If you look at where we're at, a significant part of what we need to go do is essentially take the core model that we've been operating since we've been starting in streaming, and just execute it better in all dimensions. Whether it's the incredible content that Bella and Scott's teams are producing constantly, how we're talking about that content through the marketing and conversation that we do, the product experiences, and business model innovations that we're doing, a lot of it really fundamentally is about executing that core model better.\nThere's not a lot of massive pivots away from a traditional legacy business model that we have to go figure out. We're planting some seeds in terms of games and things like that that if we execute well, and we're excited about the progress we're seeing so far, will represent the future potential for us in terms of growth and more profit opportunities. That's exciting. Essentially, a lot of this is just continue to execute the play that we've got, and do it better and better.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI don't know about the similarities, but I would say that this business is really completely about engagement, profit, and revenue. We've got to grow all of those things, and all those things really are tied to executing on the content. When the content's working, the business is working. We grow engagement, we grow revenue, we grow profit. There's an interesting thing starting in July, and you think about from Stranger Things season four, from the phenomena that became and what we've been able to offer up to our members from that day forward.\nThey went from Stranger Things to Extraordinary Attorney Woo, which was a phenomenal success throughout Asia and in South Korea, but also built a big cult fan base in the US, straight into Sea Beast, which is our biggest animated film ever, straight into Purple Hearts and Gray Man, two of our most-watched films ever on Netflix, and then to August, The Sandman and Never Have I Ever season three, September, Cobra Kai season five, Empress.\nCyberpunk is this animated adaptation of a video game that's been hailed as one of the greatest of all time. Narco-Saints, another monster hit from North Korea, the Jeffrey Dahmer story Monster, straight into Watcher, so back-to-back hits from Ryan Murphy, All Quiet on the Western Front, which just today became the most nominated non-English film in the history of BAFTAs. Only Gandhi has gotten more nominations in the history of the BAFTAs, and that's from Germany with the great Ed Berger, then straight out of there into Enola Holmes 2, a big monster success sequel with Millie Bobby Brown.\nYou look at all these things that go back and forth, and they go all the way into January now. We'll end the month with You People, Eddie Murphy, and Jonah Hill. Any outlet would kill to have any one of those months as their entire year, and it's our ability to fire on those cylinders and create hits, but more than that, create the expectation that as soon as you're done with this one, there's another one waiting for you.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nLet's move on to something else.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nJessica, may I? Just one thing to add. I know we're going on, but I just think the analogy is kind of fundamentally different. With ESPN and the example you gave, that was a fundamental kind of shift in the industry from 100+ million pay-TV connected homes to cord cutting that's on a path down to mid to high single-digit reductions in that distribution platform each year, and that's moving in that direction.\nIt's a shrinking core distribution platform where, you see in our earnings letter, the world is shifting from linear to streaming. Even in the largest, there is no country where streaming is more than 40% of share of TV time, and in many big countries, as you saw, it's less than 5%. It's less than 5%, it's less than 10%.\nThere's an incredible runway still in the shift from linear to streaming. For us, it's about growing into that shift and also obviously competing well, continuously innovating, and improving. What you saw or what we saw and felt when we had that decline in subscribers was really near-term limiters in growing into that big market, but the big market is still growing as opposed to fundamentally long-term limiters in that ESPN shift that you described.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. Let's move on to some of the drivers of growth, both near and medium term, and start with advertising. Your advertising platform's been open only two months, and you've amazingly given some money back to advertisers, indicating in one way that demand is exceeding supply. You guys have consistently said you're going to crawl, walk, and run. How is the crawl stage going relative to your expectations?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Like you say, it's two months. I think the hardest part is actually that first step when you're crawling because you don't really know what exactly to expect as you get it going. Now with two months, it's ridiculously early, but we we've learned a bunch already, I would say. Just ticking through this, I'd say first and foremost is that we were able to launch this very, very quickly, and the tech is all working, the product experience is good, and that's really testament to lots of hard work from both Microsoft and Netflix teams who who worked very hard to make that happen, and it's really rewarding to see.\nThe other, I'd say, pretty significantly fundamental thing is around engagement, and we see that engagement from ads plans users is comparable to sort of similar users on our non-ads plans. That's really a promising indication. It means we're delivering a solid experience, and it's better than we modeled, and that's a great fundamental starting point for us to work with. Furthermore, now we're seeing take rate and growth on that ads plan is solid.\nIt's great because partly that take rate and that growth is due to incremental subscribers coming into the service because we have a lower price point. That's $6.99 in the US, EUR 4.99 in Germany, just to give you two examples. That elasticity is a real not only a benefit to sort of growing our ad scale and sustainability, but also to the general business.\nI expect to see that continue to actually grow over the year. That take rate fits within the middle of our other plans, which is another really healthy sign. It means that we've got a complementary set of offerings that are working to sort of satisfy different needs for different consumers at the right mix of features and price points. That's quite good.\nAnother important one, I think, for the investor community, because it came up a lot before we launched, was plan switching. We aren't seeing, as expected, much switching from high-ARM subscription plans like premium into our ads plans. The unit economics remain very good as we modeled. These are all really good initial progress points, but I think it's important to reiterate that, as you mentioned, we're crawling and we'd like to move to the walking phase. We've got a lot to do to get there.\nThere's a bunch of technical improvements in terms of ad delivery, validation, measurement. We've got progress already on that, more to do in the next quarter or two, targeting improvements, which will be better for consumers, more relevant advertising, better for advertisers in terms of more value delivered, a better set of offerings, products for advertisers to buy. We've got a long list of experience improvements that we know we can deliver that'll deliver more value to both subscribers and advertisers.\nThere's just also some nuts and bolts stuff that we are learning and improving. Things like how do we do a better job with Microsoft at the ad sales and operations processes. There's so much that we need to do, both companies need to do to better serve advertisers, serve an increasing number of advertisers, and meet that demand.\nWe're just getting started. We're constantly improving, and we see the trajectory ahead of us. Really, our aspirations are ultimately successively over a period of years to basically build, just like we have essentially in terms of the streaming experience, the best, most effective, highest quality premium connected TV ads experience as a win for consumers and advertisers, and for us as a business.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nHey, Spencer, Greg. Sorry, Jessica. Spencer, Greg, maybe give a little context on Hulu, what we know about Hulu's advertising. They've had a 10-year head start. How many years will it take us to sort of pass them in all of these key dynamics?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nGreg, you want to go first or you want me?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nAll right. Let's see. Hulu, yes, they've had a long head start. They started in the ads business. They have, we would estimate, we obviously don't know exactly, but roughly half of their membership is on the ads tier. It's a multi-billion dollar business for them already, and that's a domestic business, US only, so lower reach, lower engagement than us.\nI guess the short story there is we have, given what we've seen and what Greg just outlined in terms of the engagement on our ad plan, the strength of the performance in terms of the monetization, the unit economics, and our ability to scale in a way that is even better than the comparable ad-free plan, plus providing clearly choice that our members or consumers are seeking out because of the sign-up flow that we would expect to be as large or larger over time, certainly in just our US market, and more from there.\nI just want to emphasize, it's a multi-year path. We're not going to be larger than Hulu in year one, but hopefully over the next several years, we can be at least as large, and we wouldn't be getting into this business, obviously, as you know, if it couldn't be a meaningful portion of our business. We're we're over $30 billion of revenue, almost $32 billion of revenue in 2022. We wouldn't get into a business like this if we didn't believe it could be bigger than at least 10% of our revenue and hopefully much more over time in that mix as we grow. That's how I see it without putting a specific guide on it.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYou committed to an upfront market spot, taking CBS' prior spot, CBS now [Paramount Plus], which really indicates your long-term advertising goals of being a major advertising platform. Given this is a prime spot on a critical week for advertisers in premium video, it's amazing how quickly you just took that slot away. What's the run stage and what's the timeframe to get there?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think, as Spencer talked about it, it will be an iterative process. To your point, it does signal we have big aspirations here, and we think there's a big potential opportunity. We're committed to incrementally execute against that opportunity. Just back to Spencer's point, we are starting from a zero base essentially. Also, we're starting from a history where, as a non-ads platform, we had a lot of folks who basically joined Netflix fully as non-ads subscribers. I think that we'll be working through that over a period of time. Again, our goal and aspiration is that this is a very meaningful and significant source of revenue and profit for us over many years to come.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nWhen you think about the pool of money that you're targeting linear, let's call it $50 to 60 billion business, seems like the easy money. You've mentioned already, you're just shifting to streaming from linear. We've seen all of the eyeballs move. Now you have basically more scale, more reach, but the digital pool is much larger. In the past, you've said, you've made comments, the company's made comments that you can't compete with Google and Meta, or it would be incredibly difficult to compete with them. Has this changed? Has your view changed?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNot really. I would say that initially we're competing mostly with that sort of traditional TV advertising pool. Now, I think we can layer into that over time components of what has made digital advertising so effective. If you think about the targeting capability, the fact that we're 100% signed in, fully addressable, if you think about the growing relevance of first-party data and how we do that, those are real big advantages that we can bring relative certainly to the traditional TV world.\nAgain, the form that we have, at least for the next couple of years will still be in that lean back, primarily in that lean back experience. That lends itself to certain kinds of advertising and certain kinds of advertising goal. A lot of the demand collection component that Google or Facebook is really good at we won't be well suited to compete with that for at least some time to come.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nJessica, just to add to that. The good news, as you saw in the letter, is that that branded video ad market that Greg talked about us focusing on is about $180 billion globally, ex-China and Russia. We got plenty to do and a lot of opportunity ahead of just in that area alone.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. No, it's an enormous opportunity, but besides advertising, there's an enormous opportunity in incremental subscribers, as you have mentioned. You have the lowest price service. At least now, you have the lowest price service. Can you frame the opportunity in terms of sub growth? How are you thinking about it?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. Just to comment on lowest price, again, we don't really think about the pricing question from a competitive perspective. Again, we think of ourselves as a non-substitutable good. When you when you think about Wednesday or you think about Glass Onion, these are titles you can only see on Netflix. That's extremely powerful. Scott and Bella are delivering more incredible titles that are non-substitutable in that regard.\nReally, we think about the pricing question as how do we offer a wide range of options for a wide range of consumer needs. We want to make that spectrum even wider as we seek to serve more members around the world and try and deliver appropriate value at those different price points. We're doing a good job of expanding that range.\nThere are two pools then of incremental subscribers. There's a bunch of people around the world in countries where we're not deeply penetrated, and we have more opportunity to go attract them. A component of that is we've got folks that are watching Netflix who aren't paying us as part of basically borrowing somebody else's credentials. Our goal is over this year to basically work through that situation and convert many of those folks to be paid accounts or to have the account owner pay for them to get a Netflix subscription. Either way we're seeking to sort of monetize the viewing value that we're delivering.\nBeyond that, it's back to Spencer's comment. Even our most penetrated market, we're 8% of total TV time, which is potentially a relatively narrow lens to think about the broad competitive entertainment offering. We have huge opportunity to grow the engagement component of that several x we feel like we can get to if we do a great job of executing across all fronts. That represents a tremendous opportunity for more entertainment value delivered. We believe that the revenue flows from that in time.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nBefore we get to password turn, just one last advertising question. You now have roughly a decade of producing your own IP. Any thoughts on offering a FAST service over time for your advertising supported television?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nTed, do you want to take this one?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, we're open to all these different models that are out there right now, but we've got a lot on our plate this year, both with the paid sharing, with our launch of advertising, and continuing to this slate of content that we're trying to drive to our members. We are keeping an eye on that segment for sure.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOn the password sharing, what will drive consumers to pay $3 or $4 for sharing versus becoming a sub with their own profile? Is it affordability? Is there something else? What do you expect?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I think there's a range of motivations for different borrowers. Some of it is economically driven. Part of what we're trying to do is make sure that we are being responsive to that and finding the right price points, whether in terms of an individual account or an extra member affordance. Obviously, the ad-supported plans give us the opportunity to present a lower consumer-faced pricing in those countries where we have advertising. Part of it's just what we call casual sharing, which is people could pay, but they don't need to, so they're borrowing somebody's account.\nOur job is to give them a little bit of a nudge and to create features that make transitioning to their own account easy and simple. We have this basically profile export feature, which allows you to take your viewing history and all the great recommendations with you. To your point, there's a range of motivations and I think a range of solutions that we'll be able to offer to land people in different places.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nCan you provide any details, including the timeframe for converting borrowers to paying accounts?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we've been working hard at this and trying to do some thoughtful experimentation to let our members really speak to us in terms of what set of solutions work for them. That's the testing that you've seen us do over the last couple of quarters. We feel like we have gotten to a good set of features. It's the profile export that I mentioned, but there's also a bunch of account management features that we think are important to making this experience work for folks. We're ready to roll those out later this quarter. We'll stagger that a bit as we work through sets of countries, but we'll really see that happen over the next couple of quarters.\nI think it's worth noting that this will not be a universally popular move. There will be current members that are unhappy with this move. We'll see a bit of a cancel reaction to that. We think of this as similar to what we see when we raise prices so we get some increased churn associated with that for a period of time. Generally, what happens is both from the specific changes that we make, we'll see folks come on as new subscribers, essentially borrowers, creating their accounts or incremental monetization through the extra member that'll happen shortly thereafter.\nClearly, our job is to continue to grow value, to have more amazing titles that people cannot wait to see, whether that's satisfying those members who make those transitions or winning back essentially folks who have turned off the service and bringing them back on the service over the months and years to come.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nJessica. Sorry. Because we touched on it a little bit in the letter, but just to reinforce a little bit of what that looks like in terms of timing and guidance. Those dynamics that Greg just walked through, because of that, as we start to roll this out later in Q1, based on the timing, what we talked about is that we'll have modest growth we expect in paid net adds in Q1, but atypical seasonality, where typically Q2 would be a softer paid net ad quarter. It'll probably be a larger paid net ad quarter, and most importantly, what we're most focused on is obviously revenue. That is our primary metric.\nWhat you see is in the guide, these revenue initiatives between paid sharing, rolling out, and then scaling ads, you don't see much of that in Q1, which is why we are we are forecasting 8% growth, FX-neutral, in Q1 revenue. Throughout the course of the year, we would expect to see accelerating revenue growth as we roll out paid sharing broadly across our business, and then obviously scale ads throughout the year, which is a more gradual build. I just want to highlight that, and that is kind of what you are seeing in the guidance.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGiven the revenue drivers of paid sharing and advertising, how are you thinking about price increases in the current year? Is it just too complicated? How are you thinking about it?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, I would say that the two initiatives that you described represent the bulk of our pricing strategy in 2023. We anticipate that they'll both be revenue positive, revenue creative significantly, according to the details that Spencer just offered. Now having said that, our core pricing approach and theory remains the same. We're going to look at the metrics that our members are giving us and telling us, and look for opportunities where we think we've done a good job at creating more value for them.\nFor a certain customer segment and a certain tier and a certain country, we think we've done a good job at delivering more entertainment for them, then we'll go back and opportunistically ask for them to pay a little bit more so that we can keep this virtuous cycle going, and really invest that back into incredible content and stories. Maybe Ted, I don't know if you want to highlight anything that you see coming on that side.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNo, I would just say that it's the must-seeness of the content that will make the paid sharing initiative work, that will make the advertising launch work, that will make continuing to grow revenue work. It's across film, across television. It's the content that people must see, and that it's on Netflix gives us the ability to do that. I'm super proud of the team and their ability to keep delivering on that month in and month out, and quarter in and quarter out, and continuing to grow in all these different market segments that our consumers really care about. That to me is core to all these initiatives working. We've got the wind at our back on that right now.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYou amazingly continue to expand the genres of content, which, as you guys have mentioned, clearly drives engagement. The most recent new genre, which you introduced on your platform at the very end of last month, is fitness.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThat's the time for your New Year's resolution, yes.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOne class online could be the price of a Netflix subscription. While many of the workouts are bite-sized and some are longer, they're simple but deceivingly effective. Can you talk about what your plans are in this area? To the extent you develop more content, it really, as I said, drives value for anyone who would work out anywhere else. How do you define success? Is there anything you can say about partner economics with Nike?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. We can't comment on the partner economics, but I would tell you that we've historically stayed away from the fitness category because it's abundantly available online, in many cases for free, as you know. We thought if we could partner with a great brand, and Nike is certainly a leading brand in fitness with really well-produced content, which this content is, and then let's go out to our members and see if it's something that they value. We'll see that in the engagement and see where we can take it from there.\nI think in that way, working with a great partner and the high quality, to your point, of the content itself will put it at a really good test. Do people want to use Netflix to get in shape or to get back in shape? If they do, we'd like to keep serving that. If they don't, we'll keep poking around. It's a way we were able to test the market at a very high end with a premium brand partner.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThere's constant speculation that you will experiment with sports, which is an expensive rental business for many. Does having an advertising offering change your views on offering sports? Any thoughts that on like WWE, which is for sale. I'm just saying that could be owned content. Any views on sports?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, I would say in sports, our position has been the same, which is we're not anti-sports. We're pro-profits. We've not been able to figure out how to deliver profits in renting big league sports in our subscription model. Not to say that that won't change. We'll be open to it, but that's where it's at today. WWE, we have a lot of M&A activity all the time. We look at all of them, but nothing we can comment on.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nI think this term played a role in your investment into live events. While live comedy specials seem to have a value outside of the live window, other events, like you just announced that you're going to host the SAG Awards, sports, obviously these have fairly short, useful lives. How do you balance the investment in live versus the potential to drive advertising dollars?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI would look at this as part of just like other crawl, walk, run scenarios where we are really looking at our content that would benefit creatively from being live. The results show for one of our competition series that we have or a reunion show that drives news, or like the SAG Awards, an opportunity to engage audiences live.\nBecause we've got the shelf space, we can do hours of shoulder programming around the live events and all of those things that our members may enjoy. There's nothing particularly novel about live television, as you know, but we are dabbling in it, starting with our Chris Rock live concert to try to create the excitement around live for those things that are uniquely more exciting to be live.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThe theatrical release of Glass Onion was incredibly successful in its limited release. For some, it looks like you left a lot of money on the table by not continuing beyond that one week. Do you have any regrets, or can you give us your thoughts on your evolving film strategy?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, first of all, I'm thrilled with every aspect of the release of Glass Onion starting with Rian Johnson and his great film, and Scott Stuber and the film team for bringing it to the table. I think what you saw was a lot of excitement. We drove a ton of buzz with that theatrical release, and we created a bunch of demand. That demand we fulfilled on our subscription service. Our core business is making movies for our members to watch on Netflix. That's where we're really focused. Everything else is really a tactic to drive excitement around those films.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nWhen you have a massive global hit like a Wednesday there seem to be so many ways you could drive monetization. Just staying with Wednesday for a second, the Wednesday makeup was sold out in every Max store in New York City. You could not buy it anywhere. Do you participate in these types of consumer products, or is it just a way to fuel fans, fuel engagement?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nIt's mostly to fuel engagement and fuel fandom. We actually do participate in it. Our owned content, we do drive a lot of revenue in our consumer products business, but mostly the motivation is that it's to drive fandom. Greg alluded to this earlier, but there's impact on the culture that this content can have on our platform. In our newsletter, we mentioned the Lady Gaga song that came back after 11 years because of Wednesday. That doesn't mention the four songs this year that we actually jammed back into the charts, some that never charted, and some that were off the charts for 40 years from Metallica, Kate Bush, The Cramps, that impact on culture.\nSofia Carson's music career took off because of Purple Hearts. Jenna Ortega picked up 10 million social media followers in the first week Wednesday launched on Netflix. All of these folks who built these gigantic careers on Netflix then go on to own their own companies, sell their own makeup in many cases, and become incredibly powerful influencers.\nAll of that business is drawn because of the impact of this distribution platform and this incredible UI that basically can take something like Wednesday, which was not a slam dunk for people to predict that people would love it as much as they do. The UI could pick up on that activity in the early going of the release and push it out to where it's going to be one of our most watched shows in our history all over the world. We do use consumer products as a way to intensify fandom. It could be anything from makeup from Wednesday, as you said, or maybe even a hand on your shoulder, Spence.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, you never know where Wednesday is going to show up or at least think. I didn't get my chance to talk, and at the risk of going back to the management changes. I am thrilled with the changes. I'm going to miss maybe not seeing Reed as frequently as he's supporting Greg and Ted. I just brought in a little bit of reinforcement with [Thing], even though Reed's not going anywhere. This way, I've got a little daily reinforcement.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nSticking with content for a few minutes, the local language hits are building, but so are your US hits. How do you think about allocating your $17 billion or so content budget between genres or languages? Is there any way you can parse it out?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, it's a good, it's a big task. Watching where viewing is growing and where it's suffering, and where we are under programming and over programming around the world is a big task of the job. Spencer and his team support Bella and her team in making those allocations, figuring out between film and television, between local language and what is.\nWhat's really interesting is there aren't that many global hits, meaning that everyone in the world watches the same thing. Squid Game was very rare in that way. Wednesday looks like one of those too, very rare in that way. There are countries like Japan, as an example, or even Mexico that have a real preference for local content, even when we have our big local hits.\nEvery once in a while, something like Squid Game is even a big hit in the US. Think about in Q4, we launched a top 10 non-English series nearly every week of the quarter from South Korea, Spain, Colombia, Japan, and Poland. The benefit of that kind of local language investment and the benefit of doing that early was that we become exceptional on the ground in those countries. Those content teams generate not just content people want to see, but content that's leading the industry. To have Netflix produce the Academy Award entry film for both Mexico and Germany has never happened in the history of the Oscars. It's really phenomenal.\nI mentioned earlier the All Quiet on the Western Front and the success of BAFTA. Keep in mind that these investments are important because it actually increases the total addressable audience for Netflix around the world. If we were just doing English content for the world, we would be mostly attracting Western-centric viewers, but our addressable audience is anyone who's watching TV anywhere in the world.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nJessica, we have time for one or two last questions. Just want to make sure you have a chance to ask about margins or anything else you might want to ask.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nLet's move away from content then. Free cash flow, first of all. I want an inflection point. $1.6 billion in 2022, roughly $3 billion in 2023, $4+ billion probably in 2024. Can you talk about historically you've been more builds than buy? Is there any change in philosophy as cash starts accelerating? Can you talk about overall capital priorities, and what's driving that operating margin increase?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSpencer, why don't you go first with the capital allocation philosophy if you like.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nSure. Thanks, Jessica. As we wrote in the letter, no change at all to our capital structure policy or allocation guidance, which is to first and foremost reinvest in the core business, and selective acquisitions after that. Those are the main priorities. Beyond that, if we have cash in excess of our minimum cash levels, which roughly equates to two months of revenue, we will return that to shareholders through our share buyback program.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I can pick up with margins that you can start with. It's a bit of an explanation, but if you like, in terms of just in the nearish term, our outlook for 2023, and then just generally what's driving our outlook. What you saw in the letter, it dates back, frankly, if we walk back to where we were in the beginning of 2022, when we saw slowing revenue growth, we said we're going to manage to a target operating margin of 19% to 20%, FX-neutral at those January 2022 rates. We ended the year at 20%, so at the high end of that range. Now as we turn the page to 2023, first I should say with everything we talked about, we're quite optimistic in terms of our path forward.\nI also just want to highlight there is also a kind of short-term unusual amount of less visibility than typical because these things we're talking about in terms of our revenue initiatives, whether it's scaling our ads platform, launching paid sharing, which hasn't globally rolled out yet, these things are early days, and all multinationals have a level of macro uncertainty. That's a bit of a caveat in terms of the variability in the forecast. What we see is we see with our path to accelerating revenue growth and our high confidence there that as we turn forward to 2023, we're guiding to now 21% to 22% FX-neutral operating margins at those same January 2022 rates.\nWe're now in a new year, so we take it forward to January 2023 to current rates. That's a range of our operating margin guidance of 18% to 20%. Now, FX-neutral for 2023, we're going to manage within that band to deliver at least within the 18% to 20% operating margin guide. That is growing margins, growing absolute profit. Really, what's reflected in there is that we have high confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue throughout the course of the year as we scale ads and we launch paid sharing. We've got high confidence in improving the service and the strength of our content slate with everything that Ted discussed here on the call.\nWe're also continuing to manage our cost structure with increasing discipline. You saw that in the back half of 2022 with our slowing expense growth, and we'll carry that through similarly in 2023. That all lends itself to our focus, which is healthy, growing double-digit revenue growth, and accelerating that revenue growth throughout the year, expanding both our absolute profit and profit margin, and then growing positive free cash flow. That's all reflected, again with the big caveat that there's a bit less visibility than typical in this near term. That's something we'll continue to work through.\nWe'll obviously know a lot more over the next couple of quarters, few quarters, as we roll out paid sharing, and we'll update guidance as appropriate. That's what plays through and then also plays through to that cash flow generation that you see, where we believe with all those dynamics, and managing at about the same level of cash content spend, that we'll have more than $3 billion, at least $3 billion, of free cash flow in the year.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThank you, Spencer, for that answer, and Jessica, for that last question, all your questions. Before I turn it over to Reed for closing remarks, I just want to say as a longtime Netflix employee, and formerly, prior to that, as an analyst covering Netflix for many years, Reed, it has been a real privilege to work alongside you. On behalf of all Netflix employees, we thank you for everything you've done for us and the company over the past 25 years. We're all super excited for the next chapter with you as our executive chairman, and Ted and Greg as our co-CEO. With that, over to you, Reed, to take us home.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWait, Spencer, because I can't just deal with this thing. I just want to thank Reed as well. This is not a goodbye, I know, but it's been fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a more incredible experience of the past four years with you as our leader. Learned so much across everything from work to humanity. I'm so thrilled with the next chapter with Greg and Ted and you. I'm super excited, and thanks, Reed.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nReed, you might be muted.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYou're muted, Reed.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix\n\nThanks, you guys. Certainly not goodbye. I'm heavily invested in Netflix success. It's been 83 earnings calls now. I honestly have loved them. I love the interaction, but it's time for Greg and Ted and the team to lead. I'll be in the prep sessions, but this will be my last earnings call on screen. Overall, I would say our first 25 years were good. I'm super excited about Netflix's next 25 years being great under our broadened leadership team. Pleasing our shareholders and members is so satisfying. I just want to thank all of you for your support and look forward to continued more progress. Thank you, everyone.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to Netflix Q1 2022 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are co-CEO Reed Hastings, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, Doug, I'm going to turn it over to you for the first question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spencer. Your tone in the letter today around competition, maturity, and macro factors is very different than it was three months ago. I was hoping that you could start out by just walking us through how your views have changed over the past few months.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix",
    "content2": "Yeah, Doug. I think our views are a little different because our numbers are a little different. If we had made our $2.5 million guidance, I think that was consistent with our thesis. The lower acquisition really forced us to tease apart what's going on. As we put in the letter, COVID created a lot of noise in how to read the situation, boosted us a lot in 2020. In 2021, I think we thoughtfully said it was mostly pull forward, which was the logical conclusion. Now coming into 2022, that doesn't really hold. Pushing into it, we realized with all of the account sharing, which we've always had, that's not a new thing. When you add that up together, we're getting pretty high market penetration.\nThat combined with the competition is really what we think is driving the lower acquisition and lower growth. On the two parts, we're working on how to monetize sharing. We've been thinking about that for a couple of years. When we were growing fast, it wasn't the high priority to work on. Now we're working super hard on it. Remember, these are over 100 million households that already are choosing to view Netflix. They love the service. We just got to get paid in some degree for them. That's part of it.\nTwo, it's really we got great competition. They've got some very good shows and films out. What we got to do is take it up a notch. I'll tell you that I know it's disappointing for investors and it is for sure. Internally, we're really geared up and this is like our moment to shine. This is when it all matters, and we're super focused on achieving those objectives and getting back into our investors' good graces.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nThe only thing I might add, Reed, is just that we put a finer point on elaborating on what we're seeing in terms of slowing growth and near-term slowing growth. The long-term addressable market, we believe, is unchanged in terms of all broadband households. It's just that we have a better sense that COVID clouded in terms of the near-term limiters to penetrate that growth and capture that market. That's one of the things that we put a finer point on in this letter. I just want to reinforce that the core addressable market is still there, and that's what we're still growing into, Doug.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, thanks. Maybe just in terms of the recent trends, if we could talk about Q1 a little bit more. You lost 200,000 subscribers or gained 500,000, ex the Russia removal. Hoping you could perhaps parse out a little bit around some of those factors that you mentioned. It sounds like acquisition might be at the top of the list, and you've talked about that for a little while now. Hoping you could isolate some of those factors and then talk to us about how that informs your Q2 guide for a loss of 2 million subscribers.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. I'll take that and then others can fill in. As you said, Doug, we guided to $2.5 million paid net adds. We delivered $0.5 million if you exclude Russia, so there's really a $2 million miss in our Q1 actuals versus guidance. What's really reflected there is acquisition growth was consistent with what we expected. We were seeing that slowdown when we did the guide, and it played out as expected. The difference is really some slight elevated churn throughout Q1. This is pretty small, so retention was still very good, but we're talking about it like 2/10 to 3/10 of a percentage point. On our big member base, that has a pretty big flow through. It's a combination of factors there.\nWe talk about interrelated factors in the letter, but one very directly that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had some spillover effect in other parts of EMEA. We saw that in the Central and Eastern European countries where there was some elevated churn. We also saw probably some a little bit more macro strain in some countries, some parts of the world, like Latin America. We mentioned that on the last call, but that was elevated. There was just a little bit more seasonality in the business. We suspect some of that is those macro factors.\nWe mentioned maybe a little bit of competition on the margin as well. That's really what we saw in Q1. That's really what's reflected in Q2, which is the continued trends we're seeing in acquisition. It's that slightly elevated churn to probably continue through the quarter. It's just a softer seasonal quarter for us typically, and that's what's reflected in the guide. A little bit of softer seasonality, and essentially the same acquisition and retention trends.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nMaybe I could pick it up and talk about the first two factors you want a little bit more detail on. We have this addressable market that's expanding over time in every country that we're operating in. It's a bunch of enabling factors like broadband and smart TVs. In some countries that we're operating in, where we've been operating the longest, like the US is a great example, we have really significant high penetration of viewers into that near-term market potential. That was really boosted by sort of this growth at the beginning period of COVID and the lockdown.\nNow, that viewer penetration is made up of two groups. One is a group that's paying us, which is great, and then there is a group of viewers that are not paying us and they're sharing someone else's account credential. We really see that second group as a tremendous opportunity because they're clearly well qualified. They have everything they need to do to get to Netflix. They know what the service is. They found titles that they want to watch. Now our job is really to better translate that viewing and the value that those consumers are getting into revenue.\nThe principal way we've got of going after that is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service with folks outside their home. If you've got a sister, let's say, that's living in a different city, you want to share Netflix with her, that's great. We're not trying to shut down that sharing, but we're going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share with her, so that she gets the benefit and the value of the service, but we also get the revenue associated with that viewing.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nMaybe let's follow up on that a little bit more, Greg. We'll come back to some of the more recent trends in a moment. I guess when we think about account sharing, just curious about the early testing that you're doing. When you think about Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, I guess now it's pretty clear to see why it's the right time to do this in a bigger way. How do you think about rolling that out in the US, and what will the implementation actually look like?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. First, it's important to note that we're trying to find a balanced approach here. We're trying to basically come up with a model that supports a customer-centric approach that still puts members in charge, that supports member choice, that delivers great entertainment value at all the options we've got, but also, very importantly, allows us to bring in revenue for everyone who's viewing and who gets value from the entertainment that we're offering in. Obviously, we're doing that so that we can invest then into more great content and a better service for everyone. There's a bunch of factors that we're working through. That's why we've deployed the tests that we have.\nFrankly, we've been working on this for about almost two years. About a year, a little bit over a year ago, we started doing some light test launches that we informed our thinking and helped us build the mechanisms that we're deploying now. We just did the first big country test. It'll take a while to work this out and to get that balance right. Just to set your expectations my belief is that we're going to go through a year or so of iterating and then deploying all of that so that we get that sort of that solution globally launched, including markets like the United States.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Maybe, Spence, just on that point, if you could just walk through the accounting a little bit here and how do you think about the uplift, whether more of it would come from ARM or from subscribers over time?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, that's great, Doug. You nailed it, which is, as you heard from Greg, we're looking to monetize sharing and meet our members where they are. You should expect that member numbers or subscriber numbers are less relevant over time because it may very likely show up in ARM. You should think about it as engagement and average revenue per member, probably increasingly important, and then obviously, revenue growth, which we've always said we're trying to optimize both near and long-term revenue growth to drive that positive flywheel of reinvestment in the business.\nIt's not that there isn't going to be a P x Q. There's still Q, but increasingly important is probably ARM, engagement, and revenue overall.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep. Just to clarify there, sub-accounts will not count as subscribers.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nThat's right. That's right. It's less distinctive of an individual household account.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. In the process, though, as some of those current shares outside the household do not become sub-accounts, you'll pick up some of those subscribers separately in addition.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nThat's right. As Greg said, we're still working through the ultimate solution here. We don't exactly know how that's going to play out. You should assume that there's kind of less importance on an individual household account number. Therefore, what's more important is revenue, viewing engagement viewing engagement, overall revenue growth, and ARM as a key metric.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nLet's go back to acquisition for a minute. You noted it has not returned to pre-COVID levels. What are the ways that you can influence acquisition beyond account sharing, which we talked about, and then beyond, of course, just creating great content?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nIt shouldn't be any more complicated than that. It shouldn't be any more complicated than that, Doug. Honestly, we've got to compete, and we've got to continue to improve on the core service, which is making TV series and films and now games that people really love. That's what we're really focused on. I think that that's a thing that we can continue to grow the business in.\nWe talked about being highly penetrated in some of those core markets with users, which means that it's harder to get them to join Netflix if they're already using Netflix. We got to figure out these different models that we're doing now to more effectively monetize that viewing. As Spence said earlier, the engagement is really key. As you see in the Nielsen data that we published in the letter, our engagement has been super healthy. Even with these heightened levels of competition, our engagement, our viewing has been very, very steady, holding on to our market share in the space.\nOn top of that, in the quarter, while we were not happy with the top-line subscriber growth, we definitely saw that the new season of Ozark, Inventing Anna, The Adam Project, and certainly the biggest of them all, the new season of Bridgerton, delivered exactly as expected, actually a little bit bigger than expected with fans.\nNow, of course, we think we've got to do that. We have to have an Adam Project and a Bridgerton every month, and make sure that that's the expectation of the service, constantly. We're definitely feeling the higher levels of penetration in those markets of users. We're definitely feeling a heightened level of competition, for sure. We've just got to continue to do what we're doing and improve each of those things.\nNow, how do you improve content? We've been doing this for a decade. Well, first of all, that's about 90 years less time than all of our competitors have been at it. I look at things like things we've been doing over the last few years that we've been improving in. Big movies. Just a few years ago, we were struggling to outmonetize the market on little art films. Today, we're releasing some of the most popular, most-watched movies in the world. Just over the last few months, things like Don't Look Up, and Red Notice, and Adam Project as examples of that. That's just in a few years of improvement on one line of content.\nAnother is unscripted. We made zero unscripted about three years ago. Today, creating these big unscripted brands and growing original unscripted universes like Too Hot to Handle, Ultimatum that's really popular right now around the world, and Selling Sunset. These are kind of large, growing, original, unscripted universes. We've come a long way from Ultimate Beastmaster, my point is.\nI think about things like our content in Korea. Again, pretty new to the market. Everybody knows about Squid Game. It was probably the biggest show in the history of television. Just a few years ago, we were producing no original content in Korea. While we all know about Squid Game, there's DP and All of Us Are Dead, and a slew of original contents that are thrilling our members in South Korea and fans around the world. We're continuing to improve constantly in getting those moments that can lead to something like a Squid Game or a Bridgerton constantly.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Okay. I want to go to pricing just for a moment. You have this confluence of trends basically that are taking place here. Greg, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the recent price increases, primarily in the US. I know it's still early in the UK, but you did mention slightly elevated churn in Q1. How much was that a factor? How is this price increase being received currently?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Top line is that the price changes, the last several price changes we've done, are generally performing as we've seen the price changes over the last several years. There's no fundamental difference in performance. First of all, these price changes are significantly revenue accretive, so that's an important top-level heuristic. We sometimes see a blip in churn, and in some markets, we also see a marginal impact on acquisition. Often, these effects are transitory, so it's sort of a change effect. We move through it and win those folks back.\nI would say the big takeaway is the vast majority of our members recognize that we're investing what they pay us and the incremental amount that we're asking them to pay us into more entertainment value back to them, back to our members, more great stories, bigger films, more variety of content, and higher quality of programming. We generally plan to continue doing what we've been doing.\nI would also say it's we're also working hard to ensure that we have a range of price points across a set of plans with different features that deliver on different consumer needs and consumer desires while making sure and being very focused that we retain good accessibility to the service for a broad group of people in every country we serve at sort of that entry level. No major changes there, and we're keeping the plan that we've got in place.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOne thing just [crosstalk].\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix\n\nRelated.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, go ahead, Reed. Sorry.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix\n\nRelated to that Greg's done great work on the price spread. One way to increase the price spread is advertising on low-end plans and to have lower prices with advertising. Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription. As much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice. Allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising tolerant get what they want makes a lot of sense.\nThat's something we're looking at now, we're trying to figure out over the next year or two. Think of us as quite open to offering even lower prices with advertising as a consumer choice. Spence, you want to keep going?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nMy point was quite tactical. I'm sure Doug's going to want to follow up perhaps on your point. I just want to be really clear on the point on Q1 performance and when I talked about slightly elevated churn relative to our expectations, that was not due to our price increases. The price increase played out, as Greg said, consistent with our expectations. We just saw some slight uptick in seasonality for the other reasons I mentioned, some of the strain in Central and Eastern Europe, some of that macro strain we saw, and maybe a little bit of competition on the margin.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Reed, you pulled me forward to advertising. I do want to get there, but it was a little further down the list. One last point just on pricing. Given all these factors that you've talked about and written about in the letter, is there a change to your view on long-term pricing power?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI would say our general view is unchanged. Again, we don't have an a priori target in markets or whatever. We've been finding our way through adding more value keeping that virtuous cycle going, that big spread that Reed mentioned. Again, we're seeking ways to actually take that spread even wider. That's why I think ads is an exciting opportunity for us that we want to explore more. No fundamental shift in our thinking about how that process works or the potential that we have in that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. All right, so let's shift to ads.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nDoug, I would just add that that's directly related to creating the content that people find to be incredibly valuable. Our long-term view of our ability to continue to do that is unchanged. There's a long history of that across entertainment for decades. People love film and TV and games content. If we can continue to deliver that value, deliver that engagement, then there's a long history of people being willing to pay for it, and as Reed said, also advertisers trying to reach those audiences. We believe we can drive that value over time and then monetize it so long as we deliver on that entertainment value.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, on advertising, I think certainly Reed, preserving the simplicity of the product has been very important. I think you've also talked a little bit about, at least in the past, perhaps not seeing the incremental profit potential as well in terms of a lower-priced ad-supported tier. Has that view changed? I guess if you were to pursue an ad-based model on a lower tier, how long would it take you to get there and roll that out? What are the key things you'd need to do along the way?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. It's not a short-term fix because once you start offering a lower-priced plan with ads as an option, some consumers take it. We've got a big installed base that probably are quite happy where they are. Think of it as it would phase in over a couple of years in terms of being material volume. In terms of the profit potential, definitely the online ad market has advanced. Now you don't have to incorporate all the information about people that you used to.\nWe can be a straight publisher and have other people do all of the fancy ad matching and integrate all the data about people. We can stay out of that and really be focused on our members, creating that great experience, and again, getting monetized in a first-class way by a range of different companies who offer that service.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Is it fair to think that it would be something you would test in a few small markets to start out and then move along?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWe're probably not that advanced. No, I think it's pretty clear that it's working for Hulu. Disney's doing it. HBO did it. I don't think we have a lot of doubt that it works that all those companies have figured it out. I'm sure we'll just get in and figure it out as opposed to test it and maybe do it or not do it. I think we'll really get in. Again, it would be a plan layer like it is at Hulu. If you still want the ad-free option, you'll be able to have that as a consumer, and if you'd rather pay a lower price and you're ad-tolerant, that's also going to cater to you also.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Let's shift gears to content. Ted, the Q2 slate includes a bunch of returning hit series like Elite, Ozark, Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy. How are you thinking about that slate in Q2? Maybe if you could also talk a little bit more about the back half as well.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, those are proven brands for us, of course. Going into that, I'll start with Stranger Things because the new season of Stranger Things is a super-sized season. It's why we cut it in half. Each episode of the new season feels like a big feature film. It's really phenomenal. We're super excited about how it's landing creatively, and how excited fans are for it. I think that's going to be obviously the big story coming up later in the quarter.\nThe finale of Ozark, which is our Emmy Award-winning fan favorite, the season three was a killer, and season four brings it home in a really incredible way. We're also wrapping up our longest-running show, Grace and Frankie, with an incredible final set of episodes coming up later this month that we're really excited about.\nWe've always said we ran through the COVID delays that had us backstack 2021. 2022 is not quite as backstacked, but it does build throughout the year, and it builds up to some of our big event films in Q4 that we're really excited about, like Knives Out 2, Gray Man coming up before that from the Russo Brothers, who we've had a lot of great success with, a really fantastic action movie with Ryan Gosling. The upcoming slate in 2022, we're confident, is better and more impactful than it was in 2021, and we think 2023 will be better and more impactful than 2022. The content flow has been fantastic, and we're really excited about it.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust to follow up on, you mentioned [crosstalk].\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI should say not obviously not to forget our international content. Elite season 5, as you know, continues a really great run for us there. We have a Korean version of Money Heist coming up called Money Heist Korea. That's really fantastic. New movie from Omar Sy, The Take Down from France. A great film from Germany, All Quiet on the Western Front. A great slate of new content from Japan, Kubi vs. Love. We're really excited about the output from all of our international territories as well.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nTed, you mentioned splitting Stranger Things into different parts. You have done that with a number of series over the last few years. I guess as streaming proliferates, it feels like there is this increasing debate around the value and stickiness of providing a full season of content all at once. Just curious about how your thinking has evolved here, given that we are seeing more of these series broken into two parts, essentially.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Splitting the seasons actually had a practical reason before, which was the COVID delays and all those projects that led us to splitting some of the seasons. What we found is that fans liked both. Being able to split it gives them a really satisfying binge experience for those people who want that really satisfying long binge experience, and then being able to deliver a follow-up season in a few months versus, in some cases, the new season of Stranger Things is coming nearly three years after the last one, or more than two anyway.\nBeing able to split the season when you can deliver both halves of it in a really high-quality way, like in the case of Ozark, had additional episodes. Both experiences were really satisfying for the binger or the one-at-a-time viewer as well.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe've also had great success in these kind of mini batches of our unscripted shows. Doing one to three episodes a week every week has also been great, and still true to the binger by giving them more than one episode to watch at a time.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYou've talked about cash content spending of around $18 billion this year. In a period of slower subgrowth, are you more likely to pull back to manage costs, or to lean in to further differentiate the offering?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nLook, I think we've got to continue to invest in the content, both in the quality and the variety of the content. We will continue to grow the content spend relative to prior years. I think in general, we look at the most important though in there is the impact of the slate. We're very focused on making sure that that impact of the slate continues to grow. We should be able to, 10 years in now, get more bang for our buck relative to what we've done ourselves and relative to the market.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Doug, to that point, obviously the revenue growth has slowed. We're going to be responsible in terms of how we manage the business. We talked about in the letter during this period of slower revenue growth, we're going to protect our operating margins roughly in line with what we guided to for this year. We're holding to our guidance for the full year 2022.\nPresumably for the next 18, 24 months, call it the next two years, we're operating to roughly that operating margin, which does mean that we're pulling back on some of our spend growth across both content and non-content spend, but still growing our spend and still investing aggressively into that long-term opportunity. We're trying to be smart about it and prudent in terms of pulling back on some of that spend growth to reflect the realities of the revenue growth of the business.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust to clarify, only because you've been saying it for many years now, the 300 basis points kind of per year over a multi-year period, obviously we were not going to see that this year. It sounds like over the next couple of years, you're thinking more flattish until you get subscribers really growing in a bigger way.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, you get revenue growth again, kind of revenue engagement are going to be primary. We'll also get subscribers going. There will be subscriber growth, primarily re-accelerating that revenue growth. We believe we have multiple levers to do that. We have high confidence in monetizing sharing, as we talked about. Reed talked about things like perhaps adding an advertising layer and obviously continuing to improve the service, grow engagement, grow revenue.\nWe have high confidence that we will accelerate revenue. When we do, we also have our commitment to continue to gradually grow our operating margins. Let's first get our revenue growth re-accelerated, and then let's talk about the pace of that margin acceleration.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nSpence, what does all of that mean for free cash flow kind of near term and then over the next couple of years? 2022 is certainly looked at as the first year of sizable and sustainable free cash flow.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. That continues. We're, as I said, managing the business prudently for all of our stakeholders. We'll be positive free cash flow this year, consistent with our expectations going into the year. We'll continue to build on that in years going forward. That's our expectation. That's what we're still planning towards. I don't know, Spencer, if you would add to that maybe.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nNo, I think you hit it on the head, Spence.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I wanted to talk about India a little bit. You cut prices significantly in December across plans. You've certainly pointed out that cable in India is around $3 a month. Just curious what the response has been like. Do you still view those changes as revenue accretive. What are you seeing in terms of maybe early behavior from some of those incremental subscribers?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I would say to your last point, the incremental subscribers are largely behaving similar to the subscribers we've added over the last 12 months. Not a fundamental difference. Really, this was a bet in terms of long-term revenue maximization, which is how we think about the top-level valuatory model we have for these things. It was stimulated specifically by the fact that Ted's team is doing some incredible work on Indian content. We saw the slate there, and we're really excited about a bunch of titles that were coming down and thought there was an opportunity to broaden the audience that got to see those titles.\nWe've seen that effect definitely take hold where we have an additional bump in subscribers that will now get to see that content. The bet is that those folks will enjoy those titles, and that they will talk enthusiastically about those titles to their friends, their family, their coworkers. That'll lead to another sort of positive momentum on the flywheel of signups.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nTed, can you elaborate a little bit more just on the content in India? I guess just how you're thinking about overall product fit at this point in the market.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. The product fit incorporates subscription prices as well, willingness, and ability to pay. We have seen a nice uptick in engagement in India. We're definitely taking it in the right direction.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I want to talk about gaming a little bit. I think, Reed, you've discussed it in the past as perhaps the next genre of content beyond TV and beyond film. Curious how you'd characterize your progress so far.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix\n\nI'm really happy with what the team has built, a big capacity to be able to provide our members with interactive and gaming experiences. We've had some nice successes, which I'll let Greg talk about. I think we're building capacity, frankly, faster than we did when we entered film. That's very encouraging. So excited. You've seen we've been doing these small acquisitions to build up the know-how and the creative chops to be able to make some really great games.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Just to pick it up. Sorry, Doug, do you want to?\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nI'm sure it's where you're going. I was just going to ask what the puts and takes are around owning versus licensing IP, and what the appetite is for further M&A going forward.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. We're open to both models. I would say we're very enthusiastic about building internal capacity. We're doing this both from sort of assembling it organically, as well as through acquisition, which is a key part of our strategy to be able to build the capacity to produce the games titles that we think are really going to unlock value for our members. We're learning more and more every day from the licensed titles that we've got, which is helpful.\nThere's an early glimmer of where we're trying to head with this with the announcement we just recently did with a launch of both a game and an animated series around the Exploding Kittens IP. I don't know if you're familiar with this card game, but it's a super fun physical card game that we're now going to bring to form in both an animated series and a game. We'll have some interplay between these two different modes for fans of that IP.\nThat's an initial step on a long roadmap we have around thinking about how do we make the film and series side and then the interactive games experience, the interplay between those, magnify the value that our members are getting from both. It's like a 1 + 1 = 3 and then hopefully 4 and then 5 situation. That's the multi-year vision that we've got behind it. To deliver on that, we think the internal development capacity is going to be key because we can obviously have those folks be very specifically focused on the opportunities that we see there.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nWhat are the benchmarks or milestones perhaps that you need to see around gaming to lean in even more here in terms of content budget? Are there any metrics or numbers that you can provide so far?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI can certainly provide the framework that we're thinking about. It's a top-level priority for us, and we're very focused on it. Bottom line, we think about games and delivering value to members and reflecting that back into the business through both acquisition. We're aiming to have titles that land that create conversation, enthusiasm, and buzz that drive more people to sign up for the service. Obviously, in retention as well. Engagement is that primary leading indicator that we have for retention and value delivered. We're looking at both of those very, very carefully.\nSimilar to how we think about it on the film and series side, obviously we want to make sure the investment that we're making in any given title is calibrated to that business value that we're getting out of it. We're building our understanding of how those metrics work together so that we can have a good fitness function around the work that we're doing and making sure that it's delivering value. That's really the go signs for us that we've got it figured out, and we want to ramp and scale the investment.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Ted, Netflix shares are back to of course back to pre-COVID levels, but they're also around the same level they were at nearly four years ago in 2018. If you could just talk about your ability to continue to hire great talent within the company.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nLook, I think that when people join Netflix, they join Netflix because they believe in this long-term vision of the move away from linear television and kind of transactional movie business into a business that could be much more satisfying for consumers, deliver on the culture, and deliver big audiences, and really move the market.\nOne of the things I'd say by way of example is what we can do around the world. Our teams on the ground, our creative executives, our business executives are on the ground all over the world, are much more empowered, they're much more collaborative, and they're much more risk tolerant than their counterparts all over the world, which enables and creates an ecosystem for something like Squid Game or for like a Lupin or a La Casa de Papel to exist. Our ability to do that and to bring global notoriety to local content players is unprecedented, and it's pretty unrivaled at this point. I think people look at that as something to be very exciting to be close to.\nIn the long, long term, the long-term story is the broadband household penetration. We're going to get to those houses. There's a long-term and a short-term. In the short-term, you've got the highly penetrated users, and we're working through that right now. In the long-term, you've got things like smart TV sales and a bunch of macro factors that slow that down that we know that we all see that as temporary, including everyone who works at Netflix. Everyone really does see the long play.\nI've been here for more than 20 years and have been through a couple of these. Yes, they don't feel great in the moment, but man, it feels great to come out on the other side of it. I think everyone is knowing that that's going to come up, and we'll come out on the other side of it.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nDoug, we have time for two last questions, please.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I wanted to just back to content for a minute. You've driven a lot of attention to Formula 1 with Drive to Survive. Given the success there sports is obviously a frequent topic. How are you thinking about sports? There's certainly more rumblings around doing things related to NFL, media, and NFL films. How are your how are your intentions shifting perhaps here at all?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nLook, we expand our content verticals constantly. For us, I look at the games as a great example of adding something brand new to the service, something new for our members to enjoy. We're going down the game path because I think it fits us really nicely. Our ability to tell stories and build worlds are very consistent with our existing skill set and culture. We think that we can build a big revenue and profit stream by adding games. We're not quite so sure that you can add the big profit stream by adding sports.Other folks are trying it, and we've gone down this other path.\nIn the meantime, we're incredibly excited about, as you mentioned, the Formula 1 Drive to Survive as an example of sports-adjacent programming that our members really value. We've grown the sport tremendously. We're taking that bet in the world of tennis, golf, and others coming up. We also have an incredible sports documentary business that keeps growing. I'm not saying we never would do sports, but we'd have to see a path to growing a big revenue stream and a big profit stream with it.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Just to close out, Reed, you've created this very unique, very successful culture within the company over the past 20+ years. Has anything changed in your view just from a cultural perspective around either content acquisition or in some of the more operational functions?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nExecutive Chairman, Netflix\n\nYeah. We change every year, hopefully for the better. We don't look at culture as some fixed thing. We look at it as what's going to drive excellence. The North Star is getting excellence. We've made a bunch of adjustments as we've expanded around the world. We've made adjustments as we've become more original content-centric. We're always improving. Again, the goal is excellence, and then a culture is a tactic in that journey.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you all.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nReed, Ted, did you want to close us out?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nHey, can I say one thing before they close us out, just a tactical thing. One tactical thing that I should have mentioned earlier, Doug, I just want to make sure there's not a read-through when we guide to -$2 million paid net adds in Q2. We didn't talk about full year and what we expect. We're not providing full year guidance, Doug, but I just want to make sure there's not a read-through from -$2 million paid net adds in Q2 that there's going to be a steady trip down.",

Joining me today are Co-CEO Reed Hastings, Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, let's jump into it. Doug, over to you for your first question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spencer. Great to see all of you, and thanks for having me join you again today. Let's jump in with advertising. Obviously, a lot of discussion here heading into the launch. You announced details for the new Basic with Ads tier last week, launching in the US and 11 other markets. Can you help us understand how you arrived at the price point and the product features for Basic with Ads?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah, Doug. A lot of what we're thinking in terms of setting pricing for Basic with Ads and how we think about pricing in general anchors on what's the value that we're delivering consumers. We're trying to work very hard to translate the dollars that they give us into incredible shows. You can see sort of in Q3 some great examples of the series that we're delivering there, the films we're delivering there at the Q4 slate, it looks incredible as well.\nSpecifically with regard to ads, we modeled out essentially what we think the expected revenue is on the variety of different countries that we're launching in to make sure that in a combination of the subscription price that we're charging for Basic with Ads, plus that anticipated monetization, we'd be roughly, called it, unit economics-wise, revenue positive to neutral. When we look at the fact that we think that this lower consumer-facing price will bring in a lot more members, we're quite confident in the long term that this will lead to a significant incremental revenue and profit stream.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I guess just to clarify there, when you talk about kind of getting neutral and perhaps more accretive over time, what are you comparing that to on a unit economic basis that's essentially more to the basic tier?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Maybe relevant to note that we don't see a lot of members switching plans. Oftentimes when they come in and they select a plan for a given feature, let's say, that's the 4K resolution, we see that to be a pretty sticky choice. When we're thinking about unit economics being neutral to positive, we're really comparing to the like feature set in the Basic without ads.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, great. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what gives you confidence in that advertising arm. How would you frame advertiser demand thus far? I know Jeremi last week talked about having hundreds of advertisers on board, and ad inventory almost sold out.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. We started with a bunch of models that were informed by obviously the ads activities in those different countries around the world. Now we're in the point where we get to take those models and we get to bring them actually to advertisers and sort of see what's working in practice. It's been great to see both our partner in Microsoft and their sales team, as well as our small but crack ad sales team, in actual action with brands and with agencies working through that.\nI would say that the initial demand that we're seeing is very strong. People are very excited about the proposition of bringing their brands and their ads to a bunch of consumers around the world that are watching our shows. They're excited about the positioning against the incredible content and the titles that we have. That demand has been very, very strong. We're seeing a lot of the expectations that we built into our models come through in that actual sales process. That's great.\nI think it's also worth noting though that we're very much in a crawl, walk, run kind of model that we talked about before, we're sort of iteratively improving. We're building in a lot of capabilities over the next couple of quarters that we think are important to advertisers to make that advertising offering increasingly attractive and check a bunch of boxes they have. You might have seen the verification partners that we announced. That's a pretty good example of that. We got a lot more on that roadmap to go do that we're excited about delivering for brands.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. In terms of those capabilities, targeting obviously very important here as well. I think you've talked about having broad targeting by country and genre. I think within the top 10 shows, and I believe you also asked for age and gender at the time of sign-up as well. Early feedback from marketers and agencies has been that the targeting options at launch are fairly limited. What's your view on that, and how will that targeting evolve over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Again, part of what we want to do is actually get this out to market quickly. You could see we went from basically the point we announced it to delivering it in about six months, which has been a testament to a lot of hard work on internal teams and to Microsoft. We do have relatively basic targeting capabilities in terms of contextual targeting, genre, etc. That's sort of consistent with what we see with television as well, right? Obviously, now our job is to move from that into more of what we expect from a digital world where we have 100% signed-in audience, fully addressable, fully targetable. We can start to layer in additional targeting capabilities over time.\nI think it's also worth noting when we talk about that that we're very cognizant of privacy, and we want to make that paramount in how we think about this offering. All of the data that we use will just be used to basically deliver a more relevant ads offering on Netflix. We're not using that data in any way, shape, or form for profile building off Netflix or anything like that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about CPMs that are really 2 to 3x those of CTV or other AVOD players. Is that accurate? What justifies the much higher pricing for Netflix?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI'm not going to comment on any specific pricing, but I would just say that I think we've got a very attractive offering. That's a combination of the audience that we have, that we're delivering to, that oftentimes is hard to access in other ways, certainly harder to access in traditional TV in many cases. It's a result of the incredible content that we've got. Ted's team is doing an amazing job at producing titles that advertisers want to be next to. I think what you see is driving the demand and the pricing that we can get.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. You've talked in the past about wanting the ad offering to be innovative and somewhat different over time. If we think about the range of four to five minutes of ads per hour, it's certainly lower. You've talked about tight frequency capping. What else do you think is innovative, at least in the initial offering? How does that evolve more over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. As you noted, we want to start with an experience that's very pro-consumer, consumer centric. That definitely informed both our ad load and thinking about the frequency capping. What I love about those things is the more we talk to brands and advertisers, there's actually a high degree of alignment between sort of what their desires are and what we think is great for consumers.\nThey're enthusiastic about not having high frequency caps and having sort of a more unique offering there. Also, limited ad loads set their ads apart more distinctly. I think I love that alignment to begin with. Over time, we're going to access a bunch of the capabilities that you've seen us leverage over the last 10 years to think about innovation in the space.\nPersonalization, I think, is a great example where we don't need to think about the ads experience as being uniform across all of our members. We think about how we can leverage the personalization capability that we've built in terms of titles and how we present titles, and also in terms of how we present ads. I think that's an exciting dimension that we're going to work on as well.\nAdditionally, we're also excited to work with sort of partners and our advertisers to think about what is that ads experience, the ads format that is really best suited for premium connected TV. We're starting with meeting the market where it's at today. That's important to access sort of all the capabilities they've got, but we don't need to stay there. I think we're looking forward to over a couple of years understanding what the right native format for premium connected TV is and figuring out what that looks like.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nHey, Doug, I might just add also just part of the innovation was just for us the business innovation of speed to market. As Greg said, getting from announced to launch within six months, and to doing so in every region in which we operate, so 12 markets that represent well over half of our revenue today. Part of it is just that nimbleness and speed, which hopefully will bring to our innovation paths going forward as well.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. In terms of subscribers, how do you think about just this concept of kind of new net adds versus trade down from existing subs on the Basic with Ads tier? It's obviously a pretty frequent discussion with investors.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I think it's important just to reiterate that we don't see a lot of plans switching on the existing plan set. That's a worthwhile point to note. Obviously, as we stated before, we're not really trying to steer our members to one plan or another. We're trying to take a pro-consumer approach and sort of let them find and land on the right plan for them. As we stated, we modeled out that expected performance on ads monetization and factored that into our thinking around price point for the Basic with Ads. We really anticipate that this is going to be a pro-consumer model that'll be more attractive, bring more members in because the consumer pricing price is low.\nThe economics and the revenue will be fine as a result, even if some of those consumers switch plans. Again, just to restate this, when you factor in those extra members, we expect this leads to a significant and incremental revenue and profit stream.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHow do you think about the impact in terms of reducing churn, and perhaps how that plays out across some of the different markets given different characteristics and levels of penetration?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah, I think generally what we've seen is that obviously lower price helps with churn. I think that there'll be some positive dynamics there. Again, we're in early days now. We've got to launch this thing, and we'll learn so much more over the months to come.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nDoug, so much of that is tied to engagement. I mean, the best way to reduce churn is to keep them entertained.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nRight, which you've clearly done in this past quarter. We'll talk more about that in a minute. At the Code Conference last month, Sundar said that the Netflix-Microsoft ad deal is one of the biggest ad deals ever. Are there any particular components of the deal that give you confidence in the advertising revenue outlook here, and how it compares to subscription over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nOne of the big factors for us in picking Microsoft is that we felt like we were highly strategically aligned. They had an approach that was similar to ours, which is that we want to launch and then learn quickly, iterate quickly, and that there was a lot of flexibility both in terms of innovation around the formats and approaches that we've just talked about. Partly it was a lot of flexibility in thinking about how do we leverage the combined go-to-market capability that Microsoft has a lot of right now and that we have very little, but we're going to build over time.\nFrankly, when I see the demand that we're in right now, we're stretched between the two teams to really support all that. I'm actually excited about our ability to grow that capacity on the Microsoft side. I think they're going to do some hiring and building, and we're going to do some hiring and building. Then, through that joint capacity growth, be able to better serve more advertisers. Actually, we're turning some folks away right now because we just don't have the go-to-market capacity to serve everyone.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nDoug, at that same conference, Bob Iger said that linear TV was going off a cliff.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHe did.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWhat I underappreciated was just the impact on advertisers. They're just being able to reach fewer people, and then the 18 to 49 demographic is even faster than the decline in pay TV. This is what is really fueling the cycle, is the really collapse of linear TV as an advertising vehicle outside of a few properties like sports.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nReed, maybe that just brings up the question, and for you as well, Greg. I mean, when you're going out to agencies and marketers, do you feel like you're going after linear TV dollars, or are you going after digital dollars right now?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I'd say when you look at the capabilities of the current offering that we have as a publisher, I think we're mostly competitive with linear right now. Obviously, I think that we'll build into that over time. A lot of what makes digital attractive will be part of our offering as we go. Obviously, I think when you think about sort of demand capture and those direct response ads versus sort of the more brand side, we're probably going to be leaning for some time more into that brand side of things, where we can be more competitive.\nI think those roles are going to blur over time realistically. Our job is to be highly competitive with the components, the technical components that we can add in in terms of targeting, etc. We have really incredible content and an incredible audience that advertisers want to connect with, so we can also be very competitive.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Spence, in terms of ad revenue, it feels like it should be very high margin. Maybe you can just talk about some of the key costs or investments in running the ad business, given that Microsoft is responsible for the bulk of ad sales for now.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I'd agree with you, Doug. Again, we need to build this out over time. As Greg said, on a unit economic basis, we feel good that this will be kind of net neutral to positive out of the gates. When you add in the incrementality on subscribers, we think we can build a big incremental revenue and profit stream.\nThere are some costs, obviously, there's some cost to our partnership with Microsoft. There's some cost of building out our side of the internal team to kind of build out our capabilities with Jeremi and Peter. Obviously, some other costs here and there.\nOverall, I'm not going to get into specifics, but we believe this can be certainly margin accretive over time. It's going to be pretty small out of the gate. It's kind of reflected in our Q4 guidance as you can see. It's an intra-quarter launch. We're not expecting any material financial impact in this first kind of partial quarter, but we'll build over time, and it'll be added to the business.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. All right. For the record, we're not hitting subscriber numbers until about 15 minutes in here. You added 2.4 million subs in the third quarter. You're expecting 4.5 million in Q4. Maybe you can just kind of walk us through how you're feeling about core subscriber growth before you kind of get into the dynamics in 2023 around advertising and paid sharing.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWell, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. We're back to the positivity. Obviously, this quarter and the guidance for Q4 are reasonable, not fantastic, but reasonable. We got to pick up the momentum. Everything the company's focused on, whether that's on the content side, on marketing, lowering prices to the ad supported, the paid sharing, the bubble approach we're doing there, lines us up for a good next year. We still got FX. That's a huge hit as we've explained. That's not going to go away. Other than that, all the stars are lining up very well for us. Spence, do you want to add to that?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Reed, now you're doing my job for me, which is great. I appreciate that. Yes, as Reed said, we're still not growing as fast as we'd like. Yeah, we're building momentum. We're pleased with our progress, but we know we've got a lot more work to do. We're pleased with Q3. We saw acquisition growth a bit more than we had the past few quarters, which is great across every region. Churn remained, yes, slightly elevated, kind of similar to where we were at the end of Q2.\nOverall, when you combine those two things, we delivered paid net adds at 2.4 million, which was a little bit above our guide. We kind of under forecast there, obviously. For Q4, as we talked about and as Reed talked about, you mentioned we're guiding to 4.5 million paid net adds. Reflected in that guide is what we talked about. We're off to a nice start. I'm sure Ted will talk about the strength of the content slate. We started with Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, and into The Watcher and others that are building. It's a strong seasonal quarter.\nSome of those revenue accelerators that we know we're focused on in the near term, whether it's ads, we just talked a bunch about that. We don't expect at least a big financial impact in this first launch quarter. As we talked about in the letter, have a solution that we'll be rolling out in 2023 for paid sharing and monetizing all that unpaid viewing we've been talking about. That doesn't even start rolling out until early 2023.\nThere're some other near-term limiters to our growth. Take currency out, we're still penetrating the connected TV market in the sales cycle there. We got competition, we got some macro strain, whether it's higher inflation, energy prices, and some of the geopolitical strain around the world. All those things are factored into our guide. It's a little bit less visibility than we typically would see. Overall, we feel really good that we're building that momentum. We've set a path to the growth. You're seeing growth in paid net ads, both in actuals for Q3 and into the guide to Q4. Most importantly, a path to accelerate revenue growth and hit the ground running in 2023.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. You had your two biggest English language series ever, I think in the span of three to four months with Stranger Things 4 and Dahmer. Do you believe the content cadence is becoming more normalized here post-pandemic? How much of a factor were those titles in driving Q3 subs and now more momentum into the fourth quarter?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nThe big shows that folks engage with and talk about drives a lot of growth. I do think people come to value that. For us, our goal is we've got to get them to come to expect it. Right after they finish something great that they love, there's an expectation that there's something ready right behind it.\nYou described it pretty nicely. You come out of Stranger Things Season 4, you roll right into a big movie like Gray Man, or a movie that you fall in love with like Purple Hearts, or a great animated feature like Sea Beast. Then you're done with that, and you roll right into Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Right out of that, I mean, back-to-back hits from Ryan going right into The Watcher. I think that cadence is something I do think we're getting better at as we get more and more mature in our creation of original content. Remember, Doug, we've only been at it for 10 years.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nOh, go ahead, Reed. Sorry.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nTed, maybe just talk a little about the smoothing of content monthly, kind of what state we're at this year, what you think we can get to next year, sort of easing out of that COVID concentration.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. COVID got a lot of content jammed up in the later parts of the year. That impact rolls out and rolls out because even when people are getting back to normal work, they were all working on those projects during COVID. It will take several years to completely unwind the COVID logjam. Historically, Q4 tends to be a little heavier than Q1 and Q2, mostly because of the historical legacy of the fall TV series, the fall film cycles with film festivals, award cycles, and all those things that are kind of unnatural to viewers watching. We are trying to be more and more aggressive about smoothing that out to make sure that the content is available when people are ready to watch it.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nJust to add to that, it's really kind of smoothing it out across all of our content categories, so there's always something great to watch, whatever your mood or taste. Even just to build on Ted's point, it's not just kind of the English language titles. I'm sorry if I missed some of what he said, but even if you think in last quarter, whether it's every region, Sintonia in Brazil, it's The Empress in Germany, High Water in Poland, Narco-Saints in Korea, more and more of those big local titles with big local impact as well that also have the ability to travel. It's really kind of getting that cadence in every country and region around the world.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nProbably none was a better example this go around than Extraordinary Attorney Woo from Korea. 400 million hours of watching around the world. Just a real phenomenon that we can take a show that folks would view as being extraordinarily Korean and make it work around the world.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Ted, there's a lot of discussion just around the philosophy around content. I guess the question is, is your process or selectivity changing at all in terms of the green lighting of content? Does it need to?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nLook, let me go back to what I was saying earlier. We started this about 10 years ago. We had no IP. We had no library. We moved as quickly as we could to build a library of our own IP and to build our own library. In those 10 years, that library now gets more viewing, more revenue, and more profit than all of our competitors who've been at it for over 100.\nWhen I look at that and think, okay, along the way, we probably made a lot of mistakes. We learned a lot. Today, when I think about what we learned today, we've kind of developed a lot stronger skill sets, partnerships, and processes to ensure quality of delivery, working with our creators, and to give them the tools to deliver for the audience. Some things that are fairly proprietary and some things that just benefit from the scale of our business, so that they can really do what we want to do, which is please audiences.\nYou got to remember as we go, to do that, it isn't just making prestige shows in English. It's also making very kind of pop culture television across every genre, across every format imaginable. In doing that, that's the thing that I think we can bring scale, creativity, and audience connectivity that others can't compete with. For me, that's the biggest thing that, are we sharpening our tools? Are we getting better? We're definitely getting more mature about the process.\nI mean, if you go all the way back to the beginning of time, we didn't have any staff who'd had any experience creating original anything on Netflix. We built that up to where we're at today, which is in the last quarter, we've released seven of our most popular releases of all time just in this last quarter.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. You talked last quarter about content spend staying kind of flattish around a $17 billion or so number in annual cash spending. I realize that is up this year when you kind of take out the incremental COVID costs from last year. Does the discipline around content spending push you to do anything differently? I guess, what is your confidence that you can deliver both the quantity and also the quality of content that you want within that number across all regions?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nLook, I think what we're seeing, Doug, is that both the scope and scale, as well as the range and the cadence of hits, is improving. I feel better and better about that $17 billion of content spend because what we have to do is be better and better at getting more impact per billion dollars spent than anybody else. That's how we're focusing on it. I think we're spending at about the right level. As we re-accelerate revenue, we'll revisit that number, of course, but we're a pretty disciplined bunch about that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. The Knives Out sequel, Glass Onion, is pretty highly anticipated. You're going to release it in a limited number of theaters, I think for a week around Thanksgiving before hitting Netflix, I believe on 23 December. There also seems to have been a push to perhaps run it for a longer period of time in theaters. Maybe you can just talk about some of the debate there, what the rationale is to just do it for one week, and how you think that that kind of release will drive viewership on Netflix?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, first, I'll say we're in the business of entertaining our members with Netflix movies on Netflix. That's where we focus all of our energy and most of our spends. Our films are always heavily featured in film festivals around the world because they're in demand, made by the greatest filmmakers on the planet. For all those folks who can't get to a city where a festival is, this one-week release on 600 screens is a way of creating access to the film and building buzz, the same thing we're doing in those festivals. I would look at this as just another way to build anticipation for the film and build buzz and reputation for the film ahead of its Netflix release.\nThere're all kinds of debates all the time back and forth, but there is no question internally that we make our movies for our members, and we really want them to watch them on Netflix. Of course, with one week of release in theaters, most people will see them on Netflix just like they see all movies. Most people watch most movies at home. I think this particular release sits somewhere between that week we have to run movies to qualify for awards, the time that we run them in a film festival, and the time that we travel them around. It is a way of condensing that into a louder event.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Okay. Pretty clear. Let's shift gears a little bit. Talk about paid sharing. You announced profile transfer yesterday, which facilitates non-paying members shifting their recommendations, history, and other settings to a new account. Maybe you can talk about how this is a potential precursor to having borrowers kind of become either having their own accounts or adding to an existing member, and just how we should think about timing of the rollout there.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nSure. The profile transfer, I mean, supports a couple of different use cases, right? I mean, there's obviously situations where you can imagine you have a kid at home who is going to go off and become an adult and get their own account, and it supports those ones. It does enable a key thing that we learned around how we think about paid sharing.\nWe've been working really hard to try and find essentially a balanced position, an approach towards this, one that supports customer choice and, frankly, a long history of customer centricity that we think has informed how we think about establishing our service. Balancing that with making sure that as a business, we're sort of getting paid when we're delivering entertainment value to consumers.\nAs we try to deal with pretty much all of our product changes where we can try different approaches, listen to our members, and use their reactions to help us understand what's working and what's not working. We've tried a couple of different approaches in different countries. You saw that. Based on the customer feedback that we're getting, we sort of landed on an approach towards paid sharing that we think strikes that balance.\nA key component of that is the ability for borrowers, people that are using somebody else's account right now to access Netflix, to be able to create their own separate account. Part of that is transferring their profile and their viewing history, and all the great information that basically informs, hopefully, great recommendations for them. We think that that sort of separate account path will be especially attractive in countries where we're launching that lower-priced Basic with Ads plan. That lower price obviously makes that more attractive.\nAnother component of this, though, is allowing account owners to be able to pay for Netflix for some friend or family, something they want to share the service with. They're able to create a sub-account, which we're calling extra member, to enable that model too. We're trying to come up with a range of options that supports customer choice, balances those considerations, but also ensures that we got a sustainable business model that allows us to invest in more of that great entertainment that Ted's team has always focused on for all of our members. We're looking forward to getting that out in early 2023.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nDo you think extra member and kind of new accounts, could that be bigger than advertising in 2023 for Netflix?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI won't which is to be bigger or better. I think they're complementary in many ways. What we're seeing is that there's a number of different consumer needs, right? Paying for Netflix for somebody that you want to share that service with, that's a legitimate need. Creating a lower price that balances out for us as a business with monetization from ads, that's a legitimate need to get to all the great content that we're making.\nI just think of this as a range of options that try to speak to a range of different consumer needs, the right price points, the right feature set. We're really just trying to do a better job at expanding that range so that we can serve more consumers on the planet in the right way.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Spence, maybe you could talk a little bit just about the decision to no longer provide guidance on subscribers starting next quarter.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. Spencer, you want to take that one or?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nSure. Happy to take it. Appreciate the question, Doug. Maybe just to start, focusing on subscribers in our early days was helpful, but now that we have such a wide range of price points, different partnerships all over the world, the economic impact of any given subscriber can be quite different. That's particularly true if you're trying to compare our business with other streaming services.\nThat's why we've been increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top-line metric, as you've heard us talk about over the last several years. This is going to be, I think, even more important as we head into 2023 and we develop new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing, where membership growth is only one aspect of the revenue picture.\nJust to be clear, we will continue to report our global membership every quarter when we release earnings, as well as the paid net adds. We'll also continue to disclose our regional membership as we do today. In terms of our revenue guidance, you should expect that we'll give you some color on the underlying drivers of the revenue forecast, but we just won't provide a pinpoint paid net adds figure per se. Lastly, we'll continue to provide guidance for all the other metrics, Doug, that we do today, namely revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS, and share counts. In the grand scheme of things, pretty minor change.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. That's great. That's helpful. If we look at the Q4 guide, 4% operating margin, it's heavily impacted by FX pressures. I think it's 10% ex FX and, I guess, on a year-over-year basis, kind of up from 8%. If you can just talk about some of the factors there, is there anything fundamental in terms of the business that's kind of perhaps weighing there a little bit more on 4Q margins, or is it kind of all FX?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nIt's really all FX, Doug, as you said. I mean, year-over-year, FX-neutral constant currency, we'd be a 10% margin versus 8% prior 4Q, the FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter if we look at you can do the math on our four quarters now when you kind of roll it out to a full year number. We're still holding to what we're calling FX-neutral to the beginning of the year, 1 January of this year, to that 19% to 20 margin range FX-neutral. You'll see it actually is in the mid to higher end of that range.\nOn a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. There's about two and a half points of FX drag in our margin that equates to about $1 billion of revenue drag, about $800 million of margin drag. The bulk of that is being felt in the fourth quarter as it's built up through the year.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, I guess maybe you can just talk about cash content spending. Just to confirm, it sounds like you're kind of reiterating the same thing around the $17 billion types of level going forward. What does that mean for free cash flow generation over these next few years?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. As you said, we're kind of maintaining the guidance that we had. We think the $17 billion is about the right ZIP code, plus or minus, to spend based on our current revenue trajectory. As Ted said, as we hope and expect to re-accelerate revenue, we'll revisit those spend levels. For now, given all those learnings that Ted mentioned, we think we can deliver more member value per dollar of content spend than we have in the past.\nWe expect our content slate to get better and better each quarter and each year over the next couple of years. The way that then translates to cash flow for this year, we're maintaining our roughly $1 billion of free cash flow guide, plus or minus a couple hundred million. There's always movement at the end of the year for timing. Next year for that free cash flow to substantially improve beyond that, we expect it to be hopefully materially above the roughly $1 billion this year. We won't put a specific guide out now, but it'll be significantly larger.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nDoug, we have time for about two last questions, please.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Reed, according to Nielsen, streaming time now surpasses both broadcast and cable. Of course, Netflix has played a major role here in driving that transition. What does this next period of streaming look like in your view? Clearly more competitive, more ad-supported, but how else do you think it evolves?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThat's a great question, Doug. I mean, clearly, us and Disney are investing heavily, and we'll be two big brands in the premium space. YouTube is very strong on connected TVs, so they'll continue to grow. I think depending on how Sunday Ticket lands at some Apple, Amazon, somewhere else, you'll start to see a bunch of people focus on sports and bringing that over to on-demand.\nThink of how mobile telephony just slowly replaced fixed-line telephony. That was even before smartphones, right, just in the convenience. You're just going to see it grow every year for many years ahead, and it makes TV a lot more convenient, more enjoyable. A smart TV now costs less than a mobile phone. It doesn't have a battery, it's got a smaller processor, it's easier to manufacture. Smart TVs are getting ubiquitous and lower cost. There was the supply chain slowdowns, but generally, I think you'll see around the world smart TVs continuing to get to every home in the world that has a TV.\nThat's all very positive vector. Again, think of it on basically pretty steady every year climbing share. A lot of us battling it out for, do we have the best content in the world, do we have the best suggestions in the world, the lowest prices, all the classic competitive dynamics. We're pretty excited about this next phase, which is competitive excellence. It's straight-ahead execution if we can just be better than everybody else. We're pretty driven at that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. To close out, I'm not going to ask you about 4Q content, but I'd like to ask each of you the single most important thing for you and your teams to accomplish in your respective roles over the next 12 to 24 months. I'll leave it to you guys for whatever order you'd like.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI'll go first. I mean, for me, it's the overall direction of what we're doing, and that there's kind of clear context for everyone that if we execute down this particular path well, then we're going to win. That’s very exciting, and we're on target for that.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nDoug, we have to continue to deliver enormous quality and scale. The volume of releasing that we're doing, it's not that we're putting out so much content, just dumping the content into the world. We're actually trying to super serve hundreds of millions of people with individual taste and individual relationships with content. To do that at scale is something that's never been done before. We continue to kind of sharpen the tools to deliver, not just for the next 12, 24 months, but for the foreseeable future. I think this time right now is just as important as it ever has been.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nDoug, for me, I'll have two suggestions. One is, as you've heard us say, we want to build a really big, but also very profitable business. In our role in corporate strategy and planning, we want to help the company build and refine the muscle around big profits over time. Secondly, we've been doing more M&A over the last year or so, just getting better and better at that in terms of integration and making sure those deals live up to the expectation.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I can just add to Spencer's point. We're really in kind of that support role in finance and operations across the company, helping to really scale and mature that combination of creative excellence and operational excellence in our support roles, and support our ability to become a truly increasingly global company around the world with increasing kind of financial discipline to get more and more of that dollar spend onto the screen for the enjoyment of our members.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nDoug, I'll cheat and give you two. I mean, tactically, we are sprinting at ads, and it's been super fun to see teams engaged and doing incredible work to make that happen in such a short time. Behind the scenes, we're doing amazing stuff on improving what we call the choosing experience, which is the content discovery and recommendations and all the things that essentially, I think, takes all the work that Ted's teams do and tries to magnify the value of that for the users we have around the world.\nSometimes those things are subtle because they sort of happen behind the covers, if you will. Every quarter that we see improvements there, I know we're doing a good job for our members around the world.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nThanks, Doug. Since you didn't ask, I'm going to take another couple of seconds to tell you about Q4 anyway.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGo for it.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nThe Watcher is already turning out to be enormous. We have returning seasons of The Crown, Emily in Paris, Manifest, Dead to Me, Firefly Lane, Ginny & Georgia, an origin story from the world of Witcher. We have an incredible new action series starring Noah Centineo called The Recruit. We have Tim Burton's television directorial debut with Wednesday. We have a new series from Guillermo del Toro called Cabinet of Curiosities. From around the world, some of our most successful shows like Alice in Borderland, Barbarians, and Elite are back for new seasons too, all just in Q4.\nLet me say first and foremost, we have a lot of work to do to continue to re-accelerate revenue. We're really happy with our levels of engagement, the number of hit series and films that we're able to put to our members at prices that they think are a phenomenal value in these strained economic times. We're growing even in those strained economic times, with the extraordinary levels of competition out there for streaming dollars and for hours of viewing.\nWe stood up an ad product. In six months, with the tremendous demand on that product and with the great partnership with Microsoft, and with Greg Peters and this phenomenal team that runs that effort, our Basic with Ads tier is going to help us open up Netflix to a whole new audience of folks who are attracted to all that great content at an even lower price point.\nIn Q4, we look forward to bringing this incredible slate to everybody. As we continue to grow in this world of film, television, and games, we believe that the future of television, films, and games is streaming. We're working hard to continue to grow our lead in this area while we continue to bring healthy returns. We can only do that by bringing the shows, the films, and games that people love. Wait until you see Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and wait until you see the new season of The Crown, and you'll know just what I'm talking about. Thanks, Doug.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2022 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEO Reed Hastings, Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spence Neumann.\nOur interviewer this quarter is Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug now for his first question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spencer. Great to see all of you, and thanks for having me host again today. There's clearly a lot to talk about on advertising and new initiatives, but let's start with talking about recent trends. You expected to lose about 2 million subscribers in the quarter, and you did a little bit better at a loss of 970,000. What drove the slightly better-than-expected results in the quarter?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nLooking at the quarter, Doug, we're executing really well on the content side, obviously. Ozark, Stranger Things, lots of titles, lots of viewing. We're improving everything we do around marketing, improving the service, the merchandising, and all of that slowly pays off. If there was a single thing, we might say Stranger Things. Again, we're talking about losing 1 million instead of losing 2 million. Our excitement is tempered by the less bad results.\nLooking forward, streaming is working everywhere. Everyone is pouring in. It's definitely the end of linear TV over the next five, 10 years. Very bullish on streaming. Our core drivers are just continuing to improve. Of course, we'll talk later in the call about monetization and how that's improving. Tough in some ways losing a million and calling it success. We're set up very well for the next year.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nDoug, I just add to that. I mean, the business remains really resilient. I mean, basically, what you see in the quarter is it played out generally as expected, as Reed said. The -1 million versus -2 million, slightly better in terms of member growth. On revenue, operating income, cash flow, other than the strengthening US dollar, which I'm sure we'll talk about and affects multinationals around the world, our revenue was in line with guidance. If you adjust for that and our restructuring costs, our operating income was above guidance. Our EPS was above guidance, and our cash flow remained strong. Overall, generally delivering on as expected.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nAlmost all of the subscriber base has seen a pricing change over the past year. How do you think about that in terms of a factor, just perhaps in Q2 and maybe even going forward, just in terms of gross ads or churn? I think you still have perhaps some rollout in the UK and Ireland, and maybe the tail perhaps in Q2 in the US.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nGo ahead, Greg.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nOkay. Yeah, I'll kick it off, and then you can take it, Spence. I would say most of what we've seen in the countries that you mentioned are the big ones that we've done so far this year: US, UK, Ireland. We've seen pretty much the standard response that we've seen historically over the last five years or so, which is that we typically have this adjustment period where there's slightly higher churn post the price change. That's certainly what we've seen in those countries.\nIf we do a good job, basically, at taking those price changes, which are significantly net revenue positive, and investing those into more great content, their product experiences, and marketing, and magnifying the conversation around our titles, then we know that we'll deliver more entertainment value, and we'll be able to return those metrics. That's certainly what we are seeing in the United States, for example, where we're seeing those like the churn, for example, that you mentioned, returned to pre-price change levels. So largely, that performance is, as we've seen historically, and what we would expect.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nGreg, it's part of what you see in the Q2 performance and the Q3 guide is that we're getting further away from some of those price changes. We always expect to see some slight elevated churn after a price increase, as Greg said, highly kind of revenue positive. We had some elevated churn early in the quarter because we had some big price changes, big markets that had price increases like US, UK, Ireland, some other parts of EMEA early in both Q1 and rolling through Q2. As we get further past that, that's part of why you see positive paid net ads guidance in Q3.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nWhen you think about the back half, Spence, you just mentioned some of them, but some of these factors seemingly improve as you get perhaps greater distance from some of the pandemic pull forward. You mentioned greater distance from pricing, better seasonality. I think the content slate builds through the year. I guess the question is, why only 1 million net ads in Q3? How do you think about subscriber growth for the back half overall and for the entire year?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix",
    "content2": "Well, you kind of hit on it. We talked about some of the things that were near-term kind of headwinds to at least the subscriber growth numbers, as well as revenue growth in our business, whether it's the combination of growth in connected TV homes around the world. It's that, it's a little bit of paid sharing, it's competition, and some of these macroeconomic factors like higher inflation, as well as the invasion of Ukraine and the knock-on effects around EMEA and other parts of the world. We're still kind of working through that.\nExactly as you say, we get further away from price increases, we get to a stronger seasonal period, we get to strength of slate, and we're working to address all these things. Some of them take a little bit more time to address, like what we talked about with paid sharing, which we'll talk about in the letter. I'm sure you'll get to that. Some of these, we actually have to take action to further address.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. The business was very different, clearly, in 2008 and 2009. In a recession and just tougher macro in general, how do you think Netflix and streaming more broadly would hold up?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nDo you want me to take it, or do you want somebody else?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nJust to add real quick, I think it's really important that, particularly in tough economic times, consumers see Netflix as a tremendous value. Adding great content that they love and that they can't wait for the new season adds tremendous value. This Friday, what do you see, this movie, Gray Man, that's going to be premiering on Netflix. This is an enormous, big-budget action film that normally people would have to go out and spend an enormous amount of money to go see. They're going to be premiering it on Netflix.\nWe've got a steady drumbeat from movies like Me Time with Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg coming up, a new edition of 365, Next 365 Days, a big franchise, and a new season of Cobra Kai. Obviously, we saw the impact from Stranger Things this quarter. That's just like the tip of the iceberg for the value that we're bringing to the consumer, and I think the consumer will embrace that even more so in tougher economic times.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nJust extend that just a touch. I mean, we think Netflix is a great entertainment value. We want to keep and make sure that it is a great entertainment value. We try to provide a range of price points to consumers around the world to make sure that that service is accessible even in the current environment. I would say, I'm sure we'll get to this in a little bit, but I think that our ad-supported offering is an extension of that sort of pro-consumer wide range of prices that will increase the accessibility of the service, especially in the years to come.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nSpencer, go ahead. You'll hit on it. Go for it.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nOh, sorry, Doug. I was just going to add, if you zoom out a bit and look at past economic cycles, at least in the US, most forms of entertainment have been fairly resilient to downturns. There's a level of escapism, I think, that entertainment provides. Also, if you look at the pay-TV business over economic cycles, it tends to be a bit more resilient as well just because the value of in-home entertainment increases as folks perhaps don't go out as much.\nAlso, as a subscription business, it tends to be a little bit stickier. Obviously, every recession and cycle is different. We don't want to take that for granted, and we're monitoring it pretty closely. That's hopefully a little bit of helpful context for you.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. Let's shift gears, talk about advertising, clearly on everybody's minds. Reed, you've talked about making the Netflix ads tier a better ad experience than what's available on TV today. Can you give us an update on what the product will look like, some early thoughts there, and then also about more around timing, which I think you said early 2023?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThat's a great question for Greg here.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I think we're looking at this as an extension of two things that we think that we've historically done, which is, one, be very consumer centric and think about the customer experience, and then also just taking an innovation-oriented view, whether it's sort of how we started in streaming to how we think about great quality of experience and the innovations we've led, and I think in the discovery and choosing side. We think that we have a real opportunity here through a period of years, and iteratively. I want to set expectations at the onset.\nWe're going to take an iterative approach. This is what we call the crawl, walk, run model. At the beginning, it'll look what you're familiar with. Over time, we think there's a tremendous opportunity to leverage that innovation DNA that we have, as well as a bunch of just sort of enabling characteristics around addressability, measurability, and things like that to, one, provide an incredible experience for consumers, those who choose to take the ad-supported offering, but also provide an incredible experience for brands and advertisers who want to work with us to make sure that we're doing a good job of elevating what that looks like for them.\nThere's a bunch of lines of inquiry, lines of innovation that we're going after that sort of support all of that piece. I think we'll get into that iteratively as we go. I think when you look at the scale of our offering, the technical DNA, the partners that we've got lined up, I'm pretty optimistic that over a couple of years, we can deliver an experience which is fundamentally different from the ad experience on linear in a way that supports all of the stakeholders.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreg, when you say the partners that you have lined up, I mean, Microsoft, obviously, a key one. Are you referring to advertisers here as well? They're already taking a lot of interest. Maybe you could talk more about what that looks like at this early stage.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. We've seen a lot of excitement in our early discussions with brands, holding companies, and the agencies because I think for them, they've wanted to connect with the titles, the incredible content that Ted's team is putting out there.\nI think we also share a perspective on what is a great experience for consumers and for advertisers. When we think about the kind of advertising we see, frequency caps, what's a great ad experience, we're noticing a high degree of alignment there. That enthusiasm, that alignment is increasing sort of my optimism and the excitement that I've got to basically get this out there because I think it's going to be a win-win-win for all parties involved.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nIn terms of the Microsoft deal, will ads be sold early on exclusively by Microsoft? How do you think about your desire to build out more of your own sales force over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. All of the ads that are served on our ad-supported offering will come through Microsoft. That's an exclusive arrangement with them. One of the reasons that we're partnering with Microsoft, there's a bunch of fundamentals. They've got a technical capacity, which is complementary to ours, a go-to-market capacity, which we need to leverage, and it'll be very important for us.\nA key component of what we liked about this partnership was that there was sort of a flexibility and that innovation orientation that I mentioned before. They very much, I think, are approaching this as an opportunity to work together, to collaborate, and to sort of evolve both the technical capacity and also sort of what the experience is and what the go-to-market approach is. We've got lots of flexibility to work together there and evolve that over time.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. You already have tiers across a range of prices. What do you anticipate will happen in terms of members switching plans and perhaps trading down to the ad-supported tier? Do you have a view kind of long-term what percentage of subscribers might be on the ad-supported tier?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would say, in general, we know that there's price sensitivity around consumers. Some of those consumers are folks that have never actually ever signed up for Netflix. Some of them are folks that were members for us for a period of time, and they decided to cancel for a variety of reasons. Some of those are folks that are currently watching Netflix, but they're using another paying member's account credentials, right? Those all, I think, represent opportunities for us because we're bringing a wider range of prices through the ad-supported offering, a lower consumer-facing price to be able to attract a broader set of members.\nThat's sort of very consistent with our wide range of pricing and our general goals there. We think that's great for consumers, it's good for us, obviously. When we run the models and talking to brands, advertisers, to Microsoft, we look at the monetization that is the complement to that sort of subscription part of the ad-supported offering.\nWe're quite optimistic that the sort of unit economics work to make that monetization sort of equal or maybe even better than what we would see on the comparable side for the non-ad, subscription-only kind of plans. We think that this is, again, expansive from a member reach perspective, but also neutral to positive on the unit economics and monetization. That's great for us, obviously, from a business perspective.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nShould we be thinking about this as a single tier, essentially, below the basic plan?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI would say over a period of time, we think that this is sort of one of the dimensions that will inform sort of our plan structure. We've, I would say, generally are thinking of going from our good, better, best model that has been sort of the core offering that we've had into making that slightly more complicated because we're going to have more sort of discrimination features that would inform what offering consumers ultimately choose to get to. There'll be a little bit more complexity there in ads, no ads, will be one of those dimensions. We want to work into that model.\nObviously, while we're thinking about sort of the right pricing model there, we also want to keep it as simple as we can from a consumer-facing perspective. In terms of the on-ramp, the plan selection, how upsells happen, we want to sort of work those flows iteratively over time. We build into that complexity without making it overwhelming for consumers.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nSure. Okay. You talked about advertising monetization, essentially helping close the gap, perhaps with current ARM or getting above that level. How do you think about timing and perhaps how long it could take to get to kind of current ARM levels on the ad tier?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI think about the timing more as sort of how we roll this out and how we sort of build more subscribers on those ad-supported offerings. A component of this is countries. Obviously, we're launching first in the countries that have sort of the more mature ad markets, and we feel more confident in the ad monetization. We'll sort of explore next tiers of countries over time. That's a dimension of growth.\nI would say the initial response that we're getting from a brand and advertiser perspective is quite strong. We feel quite confident that as we sort of grow into this and we have more subscribers over time on these plans, at least initially, the unit economics are quite good. We don't sort of see this as building in that, call it CPM side, so much more as that we're actually building the total amount of volume on those plans and then the total amount of revenue. Again, this is going to start small relative to our total revenue mix, but we think we can grow it to be substantial over a period of time.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI think that's key, Doug, is that this is going to build over time. It's not like all of a sudden, all folks on ad-free Netflix are going to join advertising Netflix. Supply-demand, I think, probably works in our favor between both geography, as well as opening up the aperture to our members.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. You talked in a letter certainly about the ad product as having the potential and likelihood to drive overall member growth, and then certainly overall profitability. Spence, maybe you could talk a little bit about what it means for margins and some of the puts and takes there versus the current business.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI'd say overall, Doug, this is our focus, as we've talked about, these initiatives across paid sharing, as well as advertising, as ways to better monetize our viewing and grow members. As Greg said, advertising is an example, it can do both. We believe we can do this both in a revenue-accretive way as well as a profit-accretive way.\nAs we roll out a solution for paid sharing, that probably has a more near-term impact once we get to a solution that works, and there's not a lot of incremental expense to that. On the advertising side, we have some incremental costs that go against that business. As Greg said, there's incremental revenue, we believe, at the unit economic level. We think we can manage that pretty to an operating income neutral to positive pretty soon out of the gate. It's a slower build over multiple years to have a material impact on the business. Our focus across 2023 and 2024 is to build out to kind of return to a more accelerated revenue trajectory for the business.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Along those lines, there's been a lot of discussion around that Netflix needs to renegotiate deals, perhaps, with content providers to monetize through advertising. Also, a lot of your viewing clearly comes through original content. Maybe you can help us understand what needs to be done on the licensing side and how to think about some of those incremental costs.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nTed, do you want to take?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Today, the vast majority of what people watch on Netflix, we can include in the ad-supported tier today. There are some things that don't that we're in conversation with the studios on. If we launch the product today, the members in the ad tier would have a great experience. We will clear some additional content, but certainly not all of it. We're looking, but we don't think it's a material holdback to the business.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nIt's certainly a nice-to-have, Doug, but it's not a must-have. As Ted says, we can launch today without any additional content clearance rights. Hopefully, we can supplement that, but we'll be disciplined in what we do.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Got it. Okay. Why did you choose Microsoft over other potential ad partners?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nAt some basic levels, they've got the technical components we need. They've got the go-to-market components we need. They met a bunch of sort of fundamental, what I would characterize as table stakes pieces, which is a strong commitment to privacy, data protection for consumers, things that we cared a lot about and were fundamental to us.\nI would say beyond those things, it was really what I mentioned before, which is that we saw a high degree of strategic alignment in their interest in innovating in this space and really working with us over the next several years to basically try and create a new ads ecosystem around premium TV, connected TV ads.\nBoth from the consumer perspective, because that's really important, I think we've seen this sort of long arc of advertising towards very pro-consumer, let's make advertising part of the quality of the experience rather than detracting from it, as well as having a really strong brand and advertiser kind of focus on what do they need to support their goals from there. We saw that as being a lot of alignment out of that, and we're just excited to sort of work with them iteratively on making that happen.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nIs it fair to think that there are some significant guaranteed revenue commitments here over the next few years?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI would say we're not going to go into the specifics of any of the terms of the deal.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I'll try one more. I'm not sure what I'll get, but Microsoft, is the deal, can this be broader, and can it be a more strategic partnership beyond advertising? Can it involve elements of cloud, gaming, perhaps other things over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. A couple of things there. First of all, we picked Microsoft as our ads partner because we think they're going to be great as an ads partner. That was really the criteria that was used to inform how we thought about the choice. You mentioned cloud. We're super excited about Amazon and our partnership with them. We haven't changed that relationship. We haven't changed our focus on AWS as essentially our cloud infrastructure partner there.\nWe've done other stuff with Microsoft. We continue to do work with them on sort of go-to-market partnerships, things like that. We'll look for those opportunities as they exist with Microsoft and with other companies as well. I would say this doesn't foreclose on anything like that. You should think about this as this was about a great ads partnership deal at the end of the day.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Let's shift gears, talk about account sharing a little bit. You put out a blog post yesterday kind of expanding your efforts to monetize account sharing in LATAM across five new markets, but a slightly different implementation than in the first three countries that you announced in March. Just curious what you've learned here early on over these last few months, and just how you're thinking about these different implementations going forward.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. First of all, I'm excited to get to the stage. We've been sort of working behind the scenes for almost two years, building the technical capabilities to get this stuff rolled out. Now we actually get to put something in front of consumers and see how they react. This is sort of where the rubber meets the road. We've got the two models, as you expressed.\nEssentially, both of them are similar in that they ask consumers not to stop sharing so much, but just to pay a little bit more for different forms of sharing. The first model that we deployed, it's pay a little bit more to add a member and share with those additional members. The second model we're trying is pay a little bit more to add an additional home and share the account with the additional homes.\nReally, at this point, we'll sort of see what works for consumers. That's obviously the reason we're trying these different approaches, to learn more. We're learning a lot every day on a daily basis at this point in time based on what we've deployed. I would say while it's early to call it, obviously, we just are getting going on the second approach. We'll learn more from that. I would say we're tracking quite well to sort of the plan that we had in place. I am increasingly confident that based on what we're seeing, we'll have something that we can deploy next year as we were planning.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Can you talk about some of the technologies that you're using here just to ensure that you're not limiting access for legitimately paying members who are traveling or perhaps away from home, whether that's IP addresses, device ID, or other things?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. One of the reasons we've been working on this quite some time is because we were building those capacities in the background. These are mostly technical implementations that understand through a variety of network signals and stuff what is happening. We're sort of putting it through the lens of the consumer-facing model. In each of these two approaches, they have slightly different characteristics. Generally, we're trying to lean into a consumer-friendly model that supports legitimate use cases. Travel is a good example of that, personal device use using your mobile phone as you go around the world, your PC, things like that.\nSupporting those legitimate use cases, but also making sure that we're doing a good job at getting paid as a business when we're delivering entertainment to folks outside that household or that home in a way that is reasonable, where we're asking for a little bit of extra monetization to make that happen, make it a smooth transition as we can for users, and really trying to balance that sort of very pro-consumer, consumer-choice model with what we think are practical considerations as a business. Those approaches are different. That's obviously why we're trying these different things to figure out sort of which is going to work better in managing that balance point.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Timing here, I think you said is also 2023. Do you need to have account sharing and kind of lining up with the advertising tier rollout? Are there some benefits in doing that, or is it not kind of strategically important to you?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nWe're pursuing both independently because we think that there's value to the business and value to consumers, frankly, especially on the ads plan with a wide range of prices. We're pursuing them independently now. There's a great synergy that happens as we think about on sharing and paid sharing. Part of this is being able to offer to a range of folks who may be borrowing Netflix because they didn't quite see as much value from the entertainment and the viewing to sort of motivate getting their own plan. That's part of that segment.\nPart of the segment, we just havde to encourage them, push them, and nudge them to get to that point. Part of what's great about ads is that obviously we get to give folks that are seeing a little bit less value a lower price, and be able to convince more of them to sign up through that ads plan.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Ted, we're going to talk about content. I promise. All right. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how content performed in Q2 and how you're thinking about it into the back half. Stranger Things, obviously, your best English series debut of all time, Stranger Things 4, but go ahead.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, I think these titles continue to hit new heights, which is really fantastic that we could still be doing this back-to-back and delivering hits on top of hits. I think that really belongs to the content teams that do such a phenomenal job around the world. Bela Bajaria, who heads that TV group, and they keep surpassing records like we have been able to do with Stranger Things, Bridgerton, and Squid Game.\nOur biggest hits have all come out in the last 12 months, which is a really kind of a phenomenal sign of progress. Scott Stuber and his film team really killing it. Again, I'm going to call back to the Friday release of Gray Man because I think it's an unbelievable proof point of what kind of films that this team can put out.\nAgain, this is kind of back-to-back to back where I think Gray Man will join Red Notice, Adam Project, and Don't Look Up as among the most popular movies of the year, not just on Netflix, but period. I think that really is a testimony to these teams and the teams around the world working great with creators to create a platform for them to do the best work of their lives.\nWe've been really pleased with the output. We've been pleased with the performance. Thirty-five of our original shows are nominated for Emmys this year, which says a lot about the work that's coming out, including three Best Drama nominees, which happen to be among our most-watched shows on Netflix ever. The fact that they could be crowd-pleasing and award-winning is a pretty tough and pretty gratifying combination.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nTo kind of toot Ted and the team's horn, driving engagement, which is really the North Star driving viewing because then we can drive member growth and monetization around it. As we referenced in the letter, using the US market as an example, Nielsen is going to be reporting later this week 7.7% screen time share for Netflix, which is the highest we've ever been, which is, again, a testament to the team and the quality and engagement of what they're delivering.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Hopefully, they won't mind that you gave that number a little early. Okay. Let's go back to Gray Man for a minute. Ted, how are you approaching the marketing differently, perhaps for this title versus some of the other big movies that you've had in the past?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, look, I think you've seen a lot of it out there. Based on the marketability of the projects themselves, this is why our marketing spend is a bit lumpy, because really you're trying to focus on the titles that mean a lot to our members, and that create a lot of excitement and conversation around the world. Gray Man is certainly one of those movies that's going to attract a very broad audience. You'll see the marketing spend out there pretty aggressively.\nI want to point out Marian Lee, our new CMO, is doing a phenomenal job. She came from inside of Netflix. She was running the US. She hit the ground running with that remarkable Stranger Things campaign. I think our best campaign to date, one of the strongest marketing campaigns I've ever seen. She's been backed straight up with Gray Man. I think these campaigns are really doing a ton to bolster conversation around the world around these projects. It's not enough just to watch, but also to get your friends to watch with you too. It helps bring folks along into the conversation.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nWith Stranger Things 4, your best English series debut of all time, which we talked about, are there ways that you can leverage that record-breaking viewing to drive engagement with other shows and learnings that you can take to build out additional franchise content?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, I think the engagement is such an important metric because the time spent on Netflix means you come in and you're exposed to everything else we're doing as well. Greg and the product team do such a phenomenal job of audience matching to put the most relevant thing in front of you when you come to Netflix that you're bound to be exposed to something you're going to love.\nYou also see it in the kind of that targeted post-play mechanism. Once you get through that last episode and you're getting that one second of anxiety about, what am I going to watch next, you've got a couple of great choices in front of you. Folks use that tool all the time to find the next great thing to watch on Netflix. It's a pretty great audience where I think it's rewarded in that the more you watch, the more you'll find great things. I think we get a Stranger Things that really pays off. We get a Gray Man that really pays off. We just got to do that constantly, Doug. The idea is that not only can we deliver on that, but people should expect it back-to-back.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nTed, how do you balance out driving both that high-quality content and the significant scale? Because you're clearly releasing a lot of content on an annual basis, does anything change in your process around content going forward?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI think the focus on quality has always been there, and it's intensified as competition's intensified. I think we've got to really focus on working tightly. I think the output of great content is generally the result of a thousand great decisions. The most important one is the creator that you're working with and picking people who really want to win for the audience, and working with our teams to create great TV shows that can go on for multiple seasons, or great movies that spawn sequels, or just great content that comes in and lives through its life and through its episodes and makes people feel great.\nI do think that the focus on quality and the thing that I've always said from the beginning is scale. Scale is the thing that we're going to do that no one else has ever done yet. The way that we're doing it today is that kind of distributed decision-making among the teams, the decision-making on the ground in country for our teams making original content is what enables this thing to scale. If it all bottlenecks behind one or two or three decision-makers in California, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing today for sure.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. To support that content, you've talked in the past about kind of the $17 to 18 billion spending for this year. Spence, if you can update kind of how you're thinking about it for 2022. As we talk to investors, there's probably about half of them that actually want content spending to come down some and to be kind of reined in a little bit. The other half wants that to continue to grow and find more hits and go more globally.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nHave one more and have one less, Doug. Have one more walking into our life.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nI hear you. How do you think about that content spending going forward?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. I can take it, and maybe, Ted, you chime in. As you said, we're expecting to spend on cash content spend about $17 billion this year, Doug. As we look forward to 2023, next couple of few years, say we're probably in about the right ZIP code.\nWe've come through a pretty big business transition for us and the most cash-intensive portion of that transition over the last five, 10 years where we moved to Netflix Originals predominantly and producing our own content largely. About 60% of our content assets on the balance sheet are produced content. That's been a pretty big transition. We've come through that. Also, cash content spend is a little bit choppy. We went through a bit of that COVID wave where we're coming out of COVID. We got into production when we could as quickly as we could on some things, including when talent was available. That pulled forward some cash content spend in 2021 and 2022.\nI'd say just generally, when we look out the next couple of few years, we'll be probably right around in that ZIP code, which puts us in a good place. It also, as we said, we were trying to work through moderating our growth in content expense. Our content expense will continue to grow, but it's more moderated as we adjusted for the growth in our revenue.\nWe think we've gotten a lot smarter over the last decade or so of being in the originals business as to where we can direct our spend for most impact, highest impact, and highest satisfaction for our members. That's about roughly how we're thinking about it. I don't know who that makes happy, by the way. I don't know if it makes either one of them happy.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI would say, look, the way we spent to get to where we are today, and we think that we're about in the right ZIP code. Like Spence said, that COVID distortion in the last two years is going to make it a little murky. In general, I think that we're kind of in the right ZIP code. I agree.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nDoug, just to give you a sense, we have about time for two more questions. Reed, I think you want to add something.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nTed, maybe just talk about Stranger Things 4 as an example. How much did COVID inflate the production costs in your view?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, that particular show was probably affected as much as any because of the young cast, the size and scope of the production, and the multiple locations we shot in. It was a very expensive burden on the show to make sure we could deliver it. One of the catalysts of splitting the season in half was how long it took to produce that show. A lot of that was stalled because of early shutdown of the production, restarting production, and being extremely careful with the cast of the show early on in COVID. It was more financially impacted than a lot of our other projects were. Again, I think if you did it all again, as spend off the top, you might even get a couple of extra episodes out of it.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nMore broadly, maybe the way to think about it is throughout COVID, we were at various times 5% to 10 of our overall spend was kind of COVID-related costs. It started higher, worked down lower. On these kinds of numbers, that's significant. It's obviously much smaller now, but that was a big kind of drag on our overall efficiency of spend.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah, that wasn't an overall 5% across all production. Some of them impacted a lot more than others.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nExactly. Okay, I want to make sure we talk about operating margins and, of course, free cash flow. Operating margins, Spence, I think you're talking about 19% to 20 for this year, but ex restructuring and then also I think the FX changes from January when those numbers were first provided. Maybe you can just provide a little more context there.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah, when we had our call, we basically are holding to our margin guidance. At the beginning of the year on the Q4 2021 call, as we launched and started this year, we said we already saw kind of slowing revenue growth. We said, given the slowing revenue growth, we're going to manage to a 19% to 20 operating margin before any impact of major swings in FX. That's what we're still holding to. This year, we've got the FX moves, and then we also mentioned the $150 million of restructuring.\nWe're not expecting more restructuring costs throughout the year. That's what's baked into it. We're holding to our margin guide and similarly holding to it for 2023. Basically, we're saying until we reignite revenue growth, we're holding flat to that margin guide.\nOverall, underlying very healthy operating metrics. When you look at the revenue side, it was 13% constant currency revenue growth this quarter. We're guiding at 12% next quarter. You can see the read-throughs in kind of a similar range for the full year, and to 19% to 20 operating margins for this year and next. Obviously, the strengthening of the US dollar is a major outlier, and we just need to kind of work through that and operate as best we can on what we can control in the meantime.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. On free cash flow, 2022, really your first year of sustainable kind of strong free cash flow, you're talking about a billion dollars or so for the year. How are you thinking about some of the key puts and takes around that? What does substantial growth mean in 2023?\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, it'll be more than roughly $1 billion. The numbers we provided are, again, assuming no major additional kind of big swings in FX. Hopefully, we've seen most of that given the extraordinary moves in the last three to six months, more than we've seen in the last 20 years. As you say, we're guiding to $1 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million of positive free cash flow in 2022. We think that'll continue to grow substantially next year.\nIt's a combination of what we said before. We're through that kind of cash-intensive transition of our business. We're also operating at roughly similar levels of cash content spend next year as this year. In fact, as we said, we pulled forward a little bit of cash spend into 2021, 2022. Those things are kind of working in our favor as we continue to scale the business.\nI don't want to put a specific number out there, but assume it'll be kind of meaningfully more. Obviously, as we kind of work through what we expect to do in terms of accelerating our revenue growth and then start ramping up operating margins again, hopefully, there's a little bit of reversion on these various global currencies. All those things accelerate cash flow generation down the road.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. We just want to maybe close out with what content each of you are most excited about in the back half. I don't know if it's Gray Man for everybody or not, but I'm sure there's a lot of other good things.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, Gray Man has a recency event, for sure, because it's coming on this Friday, and it is mind-blowing.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nFor me, Doug, I'm super excited for Knives Out 2. I've heard great things from our content executives on that one. Definitely anticipating that one for me.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and Chief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nSpencer, you beat me to the punch there. I'm going to go Knives Out 2, but I'll flip back to what I'm currently watching, which is Umbrella Academy, which is a great current season.\n\nSpence Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI'll jump in and let Reed close it out. I've been going through Stranger Things to catch up. I just finished that, and I am really looking forward to Extraordinary Attorney Woo. I'm hearing great things from everyone throughout the hallways, and I'm excited to watch it soon.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI'm going to be in trouble because we just watched Michael Pollan about hallucinogenics and a great documentary series.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nChanging your mind.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nThanks. Thanks a lot, Doug. Billions of people around the world love streaming TV and film, and we only serve a few hundred million of them. The opportunity for growth here is enormous. We have some headwinds right now, and we are navigating through them.\nRemember, this company and this team have navigated through a lot of change in the last 20+ years. We've seen entertainment formats come and go. We've seen entertainment business models come and go, and we have managed to grow through all of them through all kinds of economic conditions and through all levels of competition. We're super confident that as long as we make the films, the TV series, and the games that people love, we're going to continue to lead this exciting and young industry. Thanks a lot, Doug.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q3 2021 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wong, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEO Reed Hastings, Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Nidhi Gupta from Fidelity. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. Nidhi, you now have the green light to ask your first question.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nAnalyst, Fidelity\n\nThank you, Spencer. Great to be with you all again. First off, I want to say congratulations on all your success in the quarter, 44 Emmy wins, the amazing viewership of Squid Game. My children will never play red light, green light again, and your acquisition of Night School Studio and the announced acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company. We have a lot to talk about this quarter.",

Joining me today are Co-CEO Reed Hastings, Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Doug Amath from JPMorgan. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug now for his first question.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spencer. Great to see all of you, and thanks for having me host again today. There's clearly a lot to talk about on advertising and new initiatives, but let's start with talking about recent trends. You expected to lose about 2 million subscribers in the quarter, and you did a little bit better at a loss of 970,000. What drove the slightly better-than-expected results in the quarter?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nLooking at the quarter, Doug, we're executing really well on the content side, obviously. Ozark, Stranger Things, lots of titles, lots of viewing. We're improving everything we do around marketing, improving the service, the merchandising, and all of that slowly pays off. If there was a single thing, we might say Stranger Things.\nAgain, we're talking about losing 1 million instead of losing 2 million. Our excitement is tempered by the less bad results. Looking forward, streaming is working everywhere. Everyone is pouring in. It's definitely the end of linear TV over the next 5, 10 years, so very bullish on streaming. Our core drivers are just continuing to improve. Of course, we'll talk later in the call about monetization and how that's improving.\nTough in some ways, losing a million and calling it success, but really, we're set up very well for the next year.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nDoug, I just add to that. I mean, the business remains really resilient. I mean, basically, what you see in the quarter is it played out generally as expected, as Reed said. The minus 1 million versus minus 2 million, slightly better in terms of member growth. On revenue, operating income, cash flow, other than the strengthening US dollar, which I'm sure we'll talk about and affects multinationals around the world, our revenue was in line with guidance. If you adjust for that and our restructuring costs, our operating income was above guidance, our EPS was above guidance, and our cash flow remained strong. Overall, generally delivering on as expected.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAlmost all of the subscriber base has seen a pricing change over the past year.\nHow do you think about that in terms of the factor, just perhaps in Q2 and maybe even going forward, just in terms of gross ads or churn? I think you still have perhaps some rollout in the UK and Ireland, and maybe the tail perhaps in Q2 in the US.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nThat's right.\nMaybe—oh, go ahead. Go ahead, Greg, and then I'll turn it.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nOkay. Yeah, I'll kick it off, and then you can take it, Spencer. I would say most of what we've seen in the countries that you mentioned are the big ones that we've done so far this year: US, UK, Ireland. We've seen pretty much the standard response that we've seen historically over the last five years or so, which is that we typically have this adjustment period where there's slightly higher churn post the price change.\nThat's certainly what we've seen in those countries. If we do a good job, basically, at taking those price changes, which are significantly net revenue positive, and investing those into more great content, their product experiences, and marketing, and magnifying the conversation around our titles, then we know that we'll deliver more entertainment value, and we'll be able to return those metrics.\nThat's certainly what we are seeing in the United States, for example, where we're seeing the churn, for example, that you mentioned, return to pre-price change levels. Largely, that performance is, as we've seen historically, and what we would expect.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nGreg, you hit on it at the end in terms of what you see in the Q2 performance and the Q3 guide is that we're getting further away from some of those price changes. We always expect to see some slight elevated churn after a price increase, as Greg said, highly kind of revenue positive. We had some elevated churn early in the quarter because we had some big price changes, big markets that had price increases like US, UK, Ireland, and some other parts of EMEA early in both Q1 and rolling through Q2. As we get further past that, that's part of why you see positive pay net ads guidance in Q3.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nWhen you think about the back half, and Spencer, you just mentioned some of them, but some of these factors seemingly improve just as you get perhaps greater distance from some of the pandemic pull forward. You mentioned greater distance from pricing, better seasonality. I think the content slate builds through the year. I guess the question is, why only 1 million net ads in Q3? How do you think about subscriber growth for the back half overall and for the entire year?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, you kind of hit on it. We talked about some of the things that were near-term kind of headwinds to at least the subscriber growth numbers, as well as revenue growth in our business, whether it's the combination of growth in connected TV homes around the world. It's that, it's a little bit of paid sharing, it's competition, and some of these macroeconomic factors like higher inflation, as well as the invasion of Ukraine and the knock-on effects around EMEA and other parts of the world. We're still kind of working through that. Exactly as you say, we get further away from price increases, we get to a stronger seasonal period, we get to strength of slate, and we're working to address all these things.\nSome of them take a little bit more time to address, like what we talked about with paid sharing, which we'll talk about in the letter. I'm sure you'll get to that. Some of these, we actually have to take action to further address.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. The business was very different, clearly, in 2008 and 2009. In a recession and just tougher macro in general, how do you think Netflix and streaming more broadly would hold up?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nDo you want me to take it, or do you want somebody else?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI'll just say, just to add real quick, I think it's really important that, particularly in tough economic times, consumers see Netflix as a tremendous value. Adding great content that they love and that they can't wait for the new season adds tremendous value in the form of this Friday, what do you see? This movie, Gray Man, that's going to be premiering on Netflix. This is an enormous, big-budget action film that normally people would have to go out and spend an enormous amount of money to go see.\nThey're going to be premiering it on Netflix. We've got a steady drumbeat from movies like Me Time with Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg coming up, a new edition of 365, Next 365 Days, a big franchise, and a new season of Cobra Kai. Obviously, we saw the impact from Stranger Things this quarter.\nThat's just like the tip of the iceberg for the value that we're bringing to the consumer, and I think the consumer will embrace that even more so in tougher economic times.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nOkay.\nMaybe Greg, just extend that just a touch. I mean, we think Netflix is a great entertainment value. We want to keep and make sure that it is a great entertainment value. We try to provide a range of price points to consumers around the world to make sure that that service is accessible even in the current environment. I would say, I'm sure we'll get to this in a little bit, but I think that our ad-supported offering is an extension of that sort of pro-consumer, wide range of prices that will increase the accessibility of the service, especially in the years to come.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust to build on, lastly, at the risk of—oh, Spencer, go ahead. You'll hit on it. Go for it.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nOh, sorry, Doug. I was just going to add, if you zoom out a bit and look at past economic cycles, at least in the US, most forms of entertainment have been fairly resilient to downturns. There's a level of escapism, I think, that entertainment provides. Also, if you look at the pay TV business over economic cycles, it tends to be a bit more resilient as well, just because the value of in-home entertainment increases as folks perhaps don't go out as much. Also, as a subscription business, it tends to be a little bit stickier. Obviously, every recession and cycle is different. We don't want to take that for granted, and we're monitoring it pretty closely. That's hopefully a little bit of helpful context for you.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. Let's shift gears, talk about advertising, clearly on everybody's minds. Reed, you've talked about making the Netflix ad tier a better ad experience than what's available on TV today. Can you give us an update on what the product will look like, some early thoughts there, and then also about more around timing, which I think you said early 2023?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThat's a great question for Greg here.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I think we're looking at this as an extension of two things that we think that we've historically done, which is, one, be very consumer-centric and think about the customer experience, and then also just taking an innovation-oriented view, whether it's sort of how we started in streaming to how we think about great quality of experience and the innovations we've led, and I think in the discovery and choosing side. We think that we have a real opportunity here to, through a period of years, and iteratively. I want to set expectations at the onset. We're going to take an iterative approach. This is what we call the crawl, walk, run model. At the beginning, it'll look what you're familiar with.\nOver time, we think there's a tremendous opportunity to leverage that innovation DNA that we have, as well as a bunch of just sort of enabling characteristics around addressability, measurability, and things like that to, one, provide an incredible experience for consumers, those who choose to take the ad-supported offering, but also provide an incredible experience for brands and advertisers who want to work with us to make sure that we're doing a good job of elevating what that looks like for them. There's a bunch of lines of inquiry, lines of innovation that we're going after that sort of support all of that piece. I think we'll get into that iteratively as we go.\nI think when you look at the scale of our offering, the technical DNA, the partners that we've got lined up, I'm pretty optimistic that over a couple of years, we can deliver an experience which is fundamentally different from the ad experience on linear in a way that supports all of those stakeholders.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreg, when you say the partners that you have lined up, I mean, Microsoft, obviously, a key one, but are you referring to advertisers here as well?They're already taking a lot of interest. Maybe you could talk more about what that looks like at this early stage.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. We've seen a lot of excitement in our early discussions with brands, holding companies, and the agencies, because I think for them, it's been they've wanted to connect with the titles, the incredible content that Ted's team is putting out there.\nI think we also share a perspective on what is a great experience for consumers and for advertisers. We think about the kind of advertising we see, frequency caps, what's a great ad experience. We're noticing a high degree of alignment there. That enthusiasm, that alignment is increasing sort of my optimism and the excitement that I've got to basically get this out there, because I think it's going to be a win-win-win for all parties involved.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nIn terms of the Microsoft deal, will ads be sold early on exclusively by Microsoft? How do you think about your desire to build out more of your own Salesforce over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. All of the ads that are served on our ad-supported offering will come through Microsoft. That's an exclusive arrangement with them. One of the reasons that we're partnering with Microsoft, there's a bunch of fundamentals. They've got the technical capacity, which is complementary to ours, a go-to-market capacity, which we need to leverage, and it'll be very important for us. A key component of what we liked about this partnership was that there was sort of a flexibility and that innovation orientation that I mentioned before.\nThey very much, I think, are approaching this as an opportunity to work together, to collaborate, and to sort of evolve both the technical capacity and also sort of what the experience is and what the go-to-market approach is. We've got lots of flexibility to work together there and evolve that over time.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. You already have tiers across a range of prices. What do you anticipate will happen in terms of members switching plans and perhaps trading down to the ad-supported tier? Do you have a view kind of long-term what percentage of subscribers might be on the ad-supported tier?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would say, in general, we know that there's price sensitivity around consumers. Some of those consumers are folks that have never actually ever signed up for Netflix. Some of them are folks that were members for us for a period of time, and they decided to cancel for a variety of reasons. Some of those are folks that are currently watching Netflix, but they're using another paying member's account credentials, right?\nThose all, I think, represent opportunities for us because we're bringing a wider range of prices through the ad-supported offering, a lower consumer-facing price to be able to attract a broader set of members. That's sort of very consistent with our wide range of pricing and our general goals there. We think that's great for consumers. It's good for us, obviously.\nWhen we run the models and talking to brands, advertisers, to Microsoft, we look at the monetization that is the complement to that sort of subscription part of the ad-supported offering. We're quite optimistic that the sort of unit economics work to make that monetization sort of equal or maybe even better than what we would see on the comparable side for the non-ad subscription-only kind of plans. We think that this is, again, expansive from a member reach perspective, but also neutral to positive on the unit economics and monetization. That's great for us, obviously, from a business perspective.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nShould we be thinking about this as a single tier, essentially, below the basic plan?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI would say over a period of time, we think that this is sort of one of the dimensions that will inform sort of our plan structure. I would say, generally, our thinking of going from our good, better, best model that has been sort of the core offering that we've had into making that slightly more complicated because we're going to have more sort of discrimination features that would inform what offering consumers ultimately choose to get to.\nThere'll be a little bit more complexity there. Ads, no ads, will be one of those dimensions. We want to work into that model. Obviously, while we're thinking about sort of the right pricing model there, we also want to keep it as simple as we can from a consumer-facing perspective.\nIn terms of the on-ramp, the plan selection, how upsells happen, we want to sort of work those flows iteratively over time so we build into that complexity without making it overwhelming for consumers.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nSure. Okay. You talked about advertising monetization, essentially helping close the gap, perhaps with current ARPU or getting above that level. How do you think about timing and perhaps how long it could take to get to kind of current ARPU levels on the ad tier?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI think about the timing more as sort of how we roll this out and how we sort of build more subscribers on those ad-supported offerings. A component of this is countries. Obviously, we're launching first in the countries that have sort of the more mature ad markets, and we feel more confident in the ad monetization.\nWe'll sort of explore next tiers of countries over time. That's a dimension of growth. I would say the initial response that we're getting from a brand and advertiser perspective is quite strong. We feel quite confident that as we sort of grow into this and we have more subscribers over time on these plans, at least initially, the unit economics are going to be quite good.\nWe don't sort of see this as sort of building in that, call it CPM side, so much more as that we're actually building the total amount of volume on those plans, and then the total amount of revenue. Again, this is going to start small relative to our total revenue mix, but we think we can grow it to be substantial over a period of time.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think that's key, Doug, is that this is going to build over time. It's not like all of a sudden, all folks on ad-free Netflix are going to join advertising Netflix. Supply-demand, I think, probably works in our favor between both geography, as well as opening up the aperture to our members.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. You talked in a letter certainly about the ad product as having the potential and likelihood to drive overall member growth, and then certainly overall profitability. Spencer, maybe you could talk a little bit about what it means for margins and some of the puts and takes there versus the current business.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI'd say overall, Doug, our focus is, as we've talked about, these initiatives across paid sharing, as well as advertising, as ways to better monetize our viewing and grow members. As Greg said, advertising is an example. It can do both, and we believe we can do this both in a revenue-accretive way, as well as a profit-accretive way.\nAs we roll out a solution for paid sharing, that probably has a more near-term impact once we get to a solution that works, and there's not a lot of incremental expense to that. On the advertising side, we have obviously some incremental costs that go against that business, but as Greg said, there's incremental revenue, we believe, at the unit economic level. We think we can manage that pretty to an operating income neutral to positive pretty soon out of the gate.\nIt's a slower build over multiple years to have a material impact on the business. Our focus across 2023 and 2024 is to build out to kind of return to a more accelerated revenue trajectory for the business.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Along those lines, there's been a lot of discussion around that Netflix needs to renegotiate deals, perhaps with content providers to monetize through advertising. Also, a lot of your viewing clearly comes through original content. Maybe you can help us understand what needs to be done on the licensing side, and how to think about some of those incremental costs.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSo today.\nYeah. Today, the vast majority of what people watch on Netflix, we can include in the ad-supported tier today. There are some things that don't that we're in conversation with the studios on. If we launch the product today, the members in the ad tier would have a great experience. We will clear some additional content, but certainly not all of it. We're looking, but we don't think it's a material holdback to the business.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nIt's certainly a nice-to-have, Doug, but it's not a must-have. As Ted says, we can launch today without any additional content clearance rights. Hopefully, we can supplement that, but we'll be disciplined in what we do.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah.\nGot it. Okay. Why did you choose Microsoft over other potential ad partners?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nAt some basic levels, they've got the technical components we need. They've got the go-to-market components we need. They met a bunch of sort of fundamental, what I would characterize as table stakes pieces, which is a strong commitment to privacy, data protection for consumers, things that we cared a lot about and were fundamental to us. I would say beyond those things, it was really what I mentioned before, which is that we saw a high degree of strategic alignment in their interest in innovating in this space and really working with us over the next several years to basically try and create a new ads ecosystem around premium TV, connected TV ads.\nBoth from the consumer perspective, because that's really important, I think we've seen this sort of long arc of advertising towards very pro-consumer, let's make advertising part of the quality of the experience rather than detracting from it, as well as having a really strong brand and advertiser kind of focus on what do they need to support their goals from there. We saw that as being a lot of alignment out of that, and we're just excited to sort of work with them iteratively on making that happen.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nIs it fair to think that there are some significant guaranteed revenue commitments here over the next few years?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nI would say we're not going to go into the specifics of any of the terms of the deal.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I'll try one more. I'm not sure what I'll get, but Microsoft, look, can this be broader, and can it be a more strategic partnership beyond advertising? Can it involve elements of cloud, gaming, perhaps other things over time?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. A couple of things there. First of all, we picked Microsoft as our ads partner because we think they're going to be great as an ads partner. That was really the criteria that was used to inform how we thought about the choice. You mentioned cloud. We're super excited about Amazon and our partnership with them. We haven't changed that relationship.\nWe haven't changed our focus on AWS as essentially our cloud infrastructure partner there. We also have done other stuff with Microsoft. We continue to do work with them on sort of go-to-market partnerships, things like that. We'll look for those opportunities as they exist with Microsoft and with other companies as well. I would say this doesn't foreclose on anything like that.\nYou should think about this as this was about a great ads partnership deal at the end of the day.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Let's shift gears, talk about account sharing a little bit. You put out a blog post yesterday kind of expanding your efforts to monetize account sharing in LATAM across five new markets, but a slightly different implementation than in the first three countries that you announced in March. Just curious what you've learned here early on over these last few months, and just how you're thinking about these different implementations going forward.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. First of all, I'm excited to get to the stage. We've been sort of working behind the scenes for almost two years, building the technical capabilities to get this stuff rolled out. Now we actually get to put something in front of consumers and see how they react. This is sort of where the rubber meets the road. We've got the two models, as you expressed.\nEssentially, both of them are similar in that they ask consumers not to stop sharing so much, but just to pay a little bit more for different forms of sharing. The first model that we deployed, it's pay a little bit more to add a member and share with those additional members. The second model we're trying is pay a little bit more to add an additional home and share the account with the additional homes.\nAt this point, we'll sort of see what works for consumers. That's obviously the reason we're trying these different approaches, to learn more. We're learning a lot every day on a daily basis at this point in time based on what we've deployed. I would say while it's early to call it, obviously, we just are getting going on the second approach, so we'll learn more from that. I would say we're tracking quite well to sort of the plan that we had in place, and I am increasingly confident that based on what we're seeing, we'll have something that we can deploy next year as we were planning.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, can you talk about some of the technology that you're using here just to ensure that you're not limiting access for legitimately paying members who are traveling or perhaps away from home, whether that's IP addresses, device ID, or other things?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah, one of the reasons we've been working on this quite some time is because we were building those capacities in the background. These are mostly technical implementations that understand, through a variety of network signals and stuff, what is happening. We're sort of putting it through the lens of the consumer-facing model. In each of these two approaches, they have slightly different characteristics. Generally, we're trying to lean into a consumer-friendly model that supports legitimate use cases. Travel is a good example of that, personal device use using your mobile phone as you go around the world, your PC, things like that.\nSupporting those legitimate use cases, but also making sure that we're doing a good job at getting paid as a business when we're delivering entertainment to folks outside that household or that home in a way that is reasonable, where we're asking for a little bit of extra monetization to make that happen, make it a smooth transition as we can for users, and really trying to balance that sort of very consumer-pro-consumer, consumer-choice model with what we think are practical considerations as a business. Those approaches are different. That's obviously why we're trying these different things to figure out sort of which is going to work better in managing that balance point.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Timing here, I think you said is also 2023. Do you need to have account sharing and kind of lining up with the advertising tier rollout? Are there some benefits in doing that, or is it not kind of strategically important to you?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nWe're pursuing both independently because we think that there's value to the business, and value to consumers, frankly, especially on the ads plan with a wide range of prices. We're pursuing them independently now. There's a great synergy that happens as we think about sharing and paid sharing. Part of this is being able to offer to a range of folks who may be borrowing Netflix because they didn't quite see as much value from the entertainment and the viewing to sort of motivate getting their own plan. That's part of that segment. Part of the segment, we just have to encourage them, push them, and nudge them to get to that point.\nPart of what's great about ads is that obviously we get to give folks that are seeing a little bit less value a lower price, and be able to convince more of them to sign up through that ads plan.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Ted, we're going to talk about content. I promise. All right. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how content performed in Q2 and how you're thinking about it into the back half, Stranger Things. Obviously, your best English series debut of all time, Stranger Things 4, but go ahead.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, I think these titles continue to hit new heights, which is really fantastic that we can still be doing this back to back and delivering hits on top of hits. I think that really belongs to the content teams that do such a phenomenal job around the world. Bella Bajaria, who heads that TV group, and they keep surpassing records like we have been able to do with Stranger Things, Bridgerton, and Squid Game.\nOur biggest hits have all come out in the last 12 months, which is really kind of a phenomenal sign of progress. Scott Stuber and his film team really killing it. Again, I'm going to call back to the Friday release of Gray Man because I think it's an unbelievable proof point of what kind of films that this team can put out.\nI think that this is, and again, this is kind of back to back to back where I think Gray Man will join Red Notice, Adam Project, and Don't Look Up as among the most popular movies of the year, not just on Netflix, but period. I think that really is a testimony to these teams and the teams around the world working great with creators to create a platform for them to do the best work of their lives. We've been really pleased with the output.\nWe've been pleased with the performance. Thirty-five of our original shows are nominated for Emmys this year, which says a lot about the work that's coming out, including three best drama nominees, which happen to be among our most watched shows on Netflix ever.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThe fact that they could be crowd-pleasing and award-winning is a pretty tough and pretty gratifying combination.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nTo kind of toot Ted and the team's horn, driving engagement, which is really the North Star driving viewing because then we can drive member growth and monetization around it. As we referenced in the letter, using the US market as an example, Nielsen is going to be reporting later this week, 7.7% screen time share for Netflix, which is the highest we've ever been, which is, again, testament to the team and the quality and engagement of what they're delivering.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Hopefully, they won't mind that you gave that number a little early. Okay. Let's go back to Gray Man for a minute. Ted, how are you approaching the marketing differently, perhaps for this title versus some of the other big movies that you've had in the past?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, look, I think you've seen a lot of it out there. I think we've done, based on the marketability of the projects themselves, this is why our marketing spend is a bit lumpy, because really we're trying to focus on the titles that mean a lot to our members, and that create a lot of excitement and conversation around the world.\nGray Man is certainly one of those movies that's going to attract a very broad audience. You'll see the marketing spend out there pretty aggressively. I want to point out Marian Lee, our new CMO, is doing a phenomenal job. She came from inside of Netflix. She was running the US. She hit the ground running with that remarkable Stranger Things campaign. I think our best campaign to date, one of the strongest marketing campaigns I've ever seen.\nShe's been there backed straight up with Gray Man. I think these campaigns are really doing a ton to bolster conversation around the world around these projects. It's not enough just to watch, but also to get your friends to watch with you too. It helps bring folks along into the conversation.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nWith Stranger Things 4, your best English series debut of all time, which we talked about, are there ways that you can leverage that record-breaking viewing to drive engagement with other shows and learnings that you can take to build out additional franchise content?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Look, I think that time spent is such an engagement is such an important metric because the time spent on Netflix means you come in, and you're exposed to everything else we're doing as well. Greg and the product team do such a phenomenal job of audience matching to put the most relevant thing in front of you when you come to Netflix that you're bound to be exposed to something you're going to love.\nYou also see it in that targeted post-play mechanism. Once you get through that last episode, and you're getting that one second of anxiety about, what am I going to watch next, you've got a couple of great choices in front of you. Folks use that tool all the time to find the next great thing to watch on Netflix.\nIt's a pretty great audience where I think it's rewarded in that the more you watch, the more you'll find great things. I think we get a Stranger Things that really pays off. We get a Gray Man that really pays off. We just got to do that constantly, Doug. The idea is that not only can we deliver on that, but people should expect it back to back.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nTed, how do you balance out driving both that high-quality content and the significant scale? Because you're clearly releasing a lot of content on an annual basis. Does anything change in your process around content going forward?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nLook, I think the focus on quality has always been there, and it's intensified as competition's intensified. I think we've got to really focus on working tightly with the great, I think the output of great content is generally the result of a thousand great decisions. The most important one is the creator that you're working with and picking people who really want to win for the audience and working with our teams to create great TV shows that can go on for multiple seasons, or great movies that spawn sequels, or just great content that comes in and lives through its life and through its episodes and makes people feel great. I do think that the focus on quality and the thing that I've always said from the beginning is scale.\nScale is the thing that we're going to do that no one else has ever done yet. The way that we're doing it today is that kind of distributed decision-making among the teams, the decision-making on the ground in country for our teams making original content is what enables this thing to scale. If it all bottlenecks behind one or two or three decision-makers in California, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing today for sure.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. To support that content, you've talked in the past about kind of the $17 to 18 billion spending for this year. Spencer, if you can update kind of how you're thinking about it for 2022. As we talk to investors, there's probably about half of them that actually want content spending to come down some, to be kind of reined in a little bit. The other half wants that to continue to grow, find more hits, and go more globally.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nHalf want more and half want less, Doug. Half want more and half want more to our life.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI hear you. How do you think about that content spending going forward?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. I can take it. Maybe, Ted, you chime in. As you said, we're expecting to spend on cash content spend about $17 billion this year, Doug. As we look forward to 2023, next couple of few years, say we're probably in about the right zip code. Cash, we've come through a pretty big business transition for us and the most cash-intensive portion of that transition over the last 5, 10 years where we moved to Netflix Originals predominantly and producing our own content largely. About 60% of our content assets on the balance sheet are produced content. That's been a pretty big transition. We've come through that. Also, cash content spend is a little bit choppy. We went through a bit of that COVID wave. We were coming out of COVID.\nWe got into production when we could as quickly as we could on some things, including when talent was available. That pulled forward some cash content spend in 2021 and 2022. I'd say just generally, when we look out the next couple of few years, we'll be probably right around in that zip code, which puts us in a good place. It also, as we said, we were trying to work through moderating our growth in content expense.\nOur content expense will continue to grow, but it's more moderated as we adjusted for the growth in our revenue. We think we've gotten a lot smarter over the last decade or so of being in the Originals business as to where we can direct our spend for most impact, highest impact, and highest satisfaction for our members. That's about roughly how we're thinking about it.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI don't know who that makes happy, by the way. I don't know if it makes either one of them happy.\nI would say, look, we spent the way we spent to get to where we are today, and we think that we're about in the right zip code. Like Spencer said, that COVID distortion in the last two years will kind of make it a little murky. In general, I think that we're kind of in the right zip code. I agree.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nDoug, just to give you a sense, we have about time for two more questions. Reed, I think you want to add something.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nTed, maybe just talk about Stranger Things 4 as an example. How much did COVID inflate the production costs in your view?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, that particular show was probably affected as much as any because of the young cast, the size and scope of the production, and the multiple locations we shot in. It was a very expensive burden on the show to make sure we could deliver it. One of the catalysts of splitting the season in half was how long it took to produce that show. A lot of that was stalled because of early shutdown of the production, restarting production, and being extremely careful with the cast of the show early on in COVID. It was more financially impacted than a lot of our other projects were. Again, I think if you did it all again, as set off the top, you might even get a couple of extra episodes out of it.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nMore broadly, maybe Reed is a way to think about it, is throughout COVID, we were at various times, 5% to 10% of our overall spend was kind of COVID-related costs that started higher, worked down lower. On these kind of numbers, that's significant, and it's obviously much smaller now, but that was a big kind of drag on our overall efficiency of spend.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah, that wasn't an overall 5% across all productions. Some of them impacted a lot more than others.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nExactly. Okay. I want to make sure we talk about operating margins, and, of course, free cash flow. Operating margins, Spencer, I think you're talking about 19% to 20% for this year, but ex restructuring. I think the FX changes from January when those numbers were first provided. Maybe you can just provide a little more context there.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nYeah. When we had our call, we basically are holding to our margin guidance. At the beginning of the year on the Q4 2021 call, as we launched and started this year, we said we already saw kind of slowing revenue growth. We said, given the slowing revenue growth, we're going to maintain or we're going to manage to a 19% to 20% operating margin before any impact of major swings in FX. That's what we're still holding to.\nThis year, we've got the FX moves, and we also mentioned the $150 million of restructuring. We're not expecting more restructuring costs throughout the year. That's what's baked into it. We're holding to our margin guide and similarly holding to it for 2023. Basically, we're saying until we reignite revenue growth, we're holding flat to that margin guide.\nOverall, underlying very healthy operating metrics. When you look at the revenue side, we're tracking 13% constant currency revenue growth this quarter. We're guiding at 12% next quarter. You can see the read-throughs in kind of a similar range for the full year, and to 19% to 20% operating margins for this year and next. Obviously, the strengthening of the US dollar is a major outlier, and we just need to kind of work through that and operate as best we can on what we can control in the meantime.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. On free cash flow, 2022, really your first year of sustainable kind of strong free cash flow, you're talking about a billion dollars or so for the year. How are you thinking about some of the key puts and takes around that? What does substantial growth mean in 2023?\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, it'll be more than roughly a billion. The numbers we provided are, again, assuming no major additional kind of big swings in FX. Hopefully, we've seen most of that given the extraordinary moves in the last three to six months, more than we've seen in the last 20 years. As you say, we're guiding to $1 billion ± a few hundred million of positive free cash flow in 2022.\nWe think that'll continue to grow substantially next year. It's a combination of what we said before. We're through that kind of cash-intensive transition of our business. We're also operating at roughly similar levels of cash content spend next year as this year. In fact, as we said, we pulled forward a little bit of cash spend into 2021, 2022.\nThose things are kind of working in our favor as we continue to scale the business. I don't want to put a specific number out there, but assume it'll be kind of meaningfully more. Obviously, as we kind of work through what we expect to do in terms of accelerating our revenue growth and then start ramping up operating margins again, hopefully, there's a little bit of reversion on these various global currencies. All those things accelerate cash flow generation down the road.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. We just want to maybe close out with what content each of you are most excited about in the back half. I don't know if it's Gray Man for everybody or not, but I'm sure there's a lot of other good things.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, Gray Man has a recency event, for sure, because it's coming on this Friday, and it is mind-blowing.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI'll go with another reason.\nFor me, Doug, I'm super excited for Knives Out 2. I've heard great things from our content executives on that one. Definitely anticipating that one for me.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nChief Product Officer, Netflix\n\nSpencer, you beat me to the punch there. I was going to go Knives Out 2, but I'll flip back to what I'm currently watching, which is Umbrella Academy, which is a great current season.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nI'll jump in and let Reed close it out. I've been going through Stranger Things to catch up. I just finished that, and I am really looking forward to Extraordinary Attorney Woo. I'm hearing great things from everyone throughout the hallways, and I'm excited to watch it soon.\n\nDoug Amath\n\nManaging Director and, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI'm going to be in trouble because we just watched Michael Pollan about hallucinogenics, and a great documentary series.\n\nSpencer Adam Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nChanging your mind.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThanks. Thanks a lot, Doug. Hey, billions of people around the world love streaming TV and film, and we only serve a few hundred million of them. The opportunity for growth here is enormous. We have some headwinds right now, and we are navigating through them. Remember, this company and this team has navigated through a lot of change in the last 20-plus years. We have seen entertainment formats come and go. We have seen entertainment business models come and go. We have managed to grow through all of them, through all kinds of economic conditions, and through all levels of competition. We are super confident that as long as we make the films, the TV series, and the games that people love, we are going to continue to lead this exciting and young industry. Thanks a lot, Doug.",

Joining me today are co-CEO Reed Hastings, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, Doug, I'm going to turn it over to you for the first question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Spencer. Your tone in the letter today around competition, maturity, and macro factors is very different than it was three months ago. I was hoping that you could start out by just walking us through how your views have changed over the past few months.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah, Doug, I mean, I think our views are a little different because our numbers are a little different. If we had made our 2.5 million guidance, I think that was consistent with our thesis. The lower acquisition really forced us to kind of tease apart what's going on. As we put in the letter, COVID created a lot of noise in how to read the situation, boosted us a lot in 2020. In 2021, I think we thoughtfully said it was mostly pull forward, which was the logical conclusion. Now coming into 2022, that doesn't really hold. Pushing into it, we realized with all of the account sharing, which we've always had, that's not a new thing. When you add that up together, we're getting pretty high market penetration.\nThat combined with the competition is really what we think is driving the lower acquisition and lower growth. On the two parts, we're working on how to monetize sharing. We've been thinking about that for a couple of years. When we were growing fast, it wasn't the high priority to work on. Now we're working super hard on it. Remember, these are over 100 million households that already are choosing to view Netflix. They love the service. We just got to get paid in some degree for them. That's part of it. Then two, we got great competition. They've got some very good shows and films out. What we got to do is take it up a notch. I'll tell you that we're all pretty—I know it's disappointing for investors, and it is for sure.\nInternally, we're really geared up, and this is our moment to shine. This is when it all matters. We're super focused on achieving those objectives and getting back into our investors' good graces.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThe only thing I might add, Reed, is just that we put a finer point on kind of elaborating on what we're seeing in terms of slowing growth and near-term slowing growth. The long-term addressable market, we believe, is unchanged in terms of all broadband households. It's just that we have a better sense that COVID clouded in terms of the near-term limiters to penetrate that growth and capture that market. That's one of the things that we put a finer point on in this letter. I just want to reinforce that the core addressable market is still there, and that's what we're still growing into, Doug.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. Maybe just in terms of the recent trends, if we could talk about Q1 a little bit more. You lost 200,000 subscribers or gained 500,000 ex the Russia removal. Hoping you could perhaps parse out a little bit around some of those factors that you mentioned. It sounds like acquisition might be at the top of the list, and you've talked about that for a little while now. Hoping you could kind of isolate some of those factors, and then talk to us about how that informs your Q2 guide for a loss of 2 million subscribers.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nSure. I'll take that, and then others can fill in. As you said, Doug, we guided the 2.5 million paid net adds. We delivered 0.5 million if you exclude Russia. There's really a 2 million miss in our Q1, actuals versus guidance. What's really reflected there is acquisition growth was consistent with what we expected. We were seeing that slowdown when we did the guide, and it played out as expected. The difference is really some slight elevated churn throughout Q1. This is pretty small. Retention was still very good, but we're talking about it like 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point. On our big member base, that has a pretty big flow through. It's a combination of factors there.\nWe talk about interrelated factors in the letter, but one very directly that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had some spillover effect in other parts of EMEA. We saw that in the Central and Eastern European countries, where there was some elevated churn. We also saw probably some a little bit more macro strain in some countries, some parts of the world, like Latin America. We mentioned that on the last call, but that was elevated. Just a little bit more seasonality in the business. We suspect some of that is those macro factors. We mentioned maybe a little bit of competition on the margin as well. That's really what we saw in Q2, I'm sorry, in Q1. That's really what's reflected in Q2, which is sort of the continued trends we're seeing in acquisition. It's that slightly elevated churn to probably continue through the quarter.\nIt's just a softer seasonal quarter for us, typically. That's what's reflected in the guide, a little bit of softer seasonality and essentially the same acquisition and retention trends.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCPO, Netflix\n\nMaybe I could pick it up and talk about the first two factors you want a little bit more detail on. We have this addressable market that's expanding over time in every country that we're operating in. It's a bunch of enabling factors like broadband and smart TVs. In some countries that we're operating in, where we've been operating the longest, like the US is a great example, we have really significant high penetration of viewers into that near-term market potential. That was really boosted by sort of this growth at the beginning period of COVID and the lockdown. Now, that viewer penetration is made up of two groups. One is a group that's paying us, which is great. Then there is a group of viewers that are not paying us, and they're sharing someone else's account credential.\nWe really see that second group as a tremendous opportunity because they're clearly well qualified. They have everything they need to do to get to Netflix. They know what the service is, they found titles that they want to watch, and now our job is really to better translate that viewing and the value that those consumers are getting into revenue. The principal way we've got of going after that is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service with folks outside their home. If you've got a sister, let's say, that's living in a different city, you want to share Netflix with her, that's great.\nWe're not trying to shut down that sharing, but we're going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share with her, so that she gets the benefit and the value of the service, but we also get the revenue associated with that viewing.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nMaybe let's follow up on that a little bit more, Greg. We'll come back to some of the more recent trends in a moment. I guess when we think about account sharing and just curious about the early testing that you're doing when you think about Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, I guess now it's pretty clear to see why it's the right time to do this in a bigger way. How do you think about rolling that out in the US, and what will the implementation actually look like?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCPO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I mean, first, it's important to note that we're trying to find a balanced approach here. We're trying to basically come up with a model that supports a customer-centric approach that still puts members in charge, that supports member choice, that delivers great entertainment value at sort of all the options we've got, but also, very importantly, allows us to bring in revenue for everyone who's viewing and who gets value from the entertainment that we're offering. Obviously, we're doing that so that we can invest then into more great content and a better service for everyone. There's a bunch of factors that we're working through. That's why we've deployed the tests that we have. Frankly, we've been working on this for about almost two years.\nAbout a year, a little over a year ago, we started doing some light test launches that informed our thinking and helped us build the mechanisms that we're deploying now. We just did the first big country test. It'll take a while to work this out and to get that balance right. Just to set your expectations, my belief is that we're going to go through a year or so of iterating and then deploying all of that so that we get sort of that solution globally launched, including markets like the United States.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Maybe, Spencer, just on that point, if you could just walk through the accounting a little bit here. How do you think about the uplift, whether more of it would come from ARM or from subscribers over time?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nYeah. That's great, Doug. You kind of nailed it, which is, as you heard from Greg, we're looking to monetize sharing and kind of meet our members where they are. You should expect that member numbers or subscriber numbers are sort of less relevant over time because it may very likely show up in ARM. You should think about it as engagement and average revenue per member, probably increasingly important, and then obviously revenue growth, which we've always said we're trying to optimize, both near and long-term revenue growth, to drive that positive flywheel of reinvestment in the business.\nIt's not that there isn't going to be a P times Q. There's still Q. Increasingly important is probably ARM, engagement, and revenue overall.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep. Just to clarify there, sub-accounts will not count as subscribers. They'll just.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThat's right. That's right. That's right. It's less distinctive of an individual household account.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. In the process, though, as some of those current shares outside the household do not become sub-accounts, you'll pick up some of those subscribers separately in addition.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThat's right. As Greg said, we're still working through the ultimate solution here. We don't exactly know how that's going to play out. You should assume that there's kind of less importance on an individual household account number. Therefore, what's more important is revenue, viewing engagement, overall revenue growth, and ARM as a key metric.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Let's go back to acquisition for a minute. You noted it has not returned to pre-COVID levels. What are the ways that you can influence acquisition beyond account sharing, which we talked about, and then beyond, of course, just creating great content?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nIt shouldn't be any more complicated than that. It shouldn't be any more complicated than that, Doug. Honestly, we've got to compete, and we've got to continue to improve on the core service, which is making TV series, films, and now games that people really love. That's what we're really focused on. I think that that's a thing that I think we can continue to grow the business in. We talked about being highly penetrated in some of those core markets with users, which means that it's harder to get them to join Netflix if they're already using Netflix. We got to figure out these different models that we're doing now to more effectively monetize that viewing. As Spencer said earlier, the engagement is really key. As you see in the Nielsen data that we published in the letter, our engagement has been super healthy.\nEven with these heightened levels of competition, our engagement, our viewing has been very, very steady, holding on to our market share in the space. In the quarter, while we were not happy with the top-line subscriber growth, we definitely saw that the new season of Ozark, Inventing Anna, the Adam Project, and certainly the biggest of them all, the new season of Bridgerton, delivered exactly as expected, actually a little bit bigger than expected with fans. Of course, we think we've got to do that, and we have to have an Adam Project and a Bridgerton every month, and make sure that that's the expectation of the service constantly. We're definitely feeling the higher levels of penetration in those markets of users, and we're definitely feeling a heightened level of competition, for sure.\nWe've just got to continue to do what we're doing and improve each of those things. Now, how do you improve content? We've been doing this for a decade. Well, first of all, that's about 90 years less time than all of our competitors have been at it. I look at things like things we've been doing over the last few years that we've been improving in. Big movies. Just a few years ago, we were struggling to outmonetize the market on little art films. Today, we're releasing some of the most popular, most-watched movies in the world. Just over the last few months, things like Don't Look Up, Red Notice, and Adam Project as examples of that. That's just in a few years of improvement on one line of content. Another is unscripted. We made zero unscripted about three years ago.\nToday, creating these big unscripted brands and growing original unscripted universes like Too Hot to Handle, Ultimatum, and that's really popular right now around the world, Selling Sunset. These are kind of large, growing, original, unscripted universes. We've come a long way from Ultimate Beastmaster, my point is. I think about things like our content in Korea. Again, pretty new to the market. Everybody knows about Squid Game. It was probably the biggest show in the history of television. Just a few years ago, we were producing no original content in Korea. While we all know about Squid Game, there's DP and All of Us Are Dead, and a slew of original contents that are thrilling our members in South Korea and fans around the world.\nWe're continuing to improve constantly in getting those moments that can lead to something like a Squid Game or a Bridgerton constantly.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Okay. I want to go to pricing just for a moment. I mean, there's a lot of you kind of have this confluence of trends basically that are taking place here. Greg, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the recent price increases, primarily in the US. I know it's still early in the UK, but I guess to what effect you did mention slightly elevated churn in Q1. I guess how much was that a factor? How is this price increase being received currently?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCPO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Top line is that the price changes, the last several price changes we've done, are generally performing as we've seen the price changes over the last several years. There's no sort of fundamental difference in performance. First of all, these price changes are significantly revenue accretive, so that's an important top-level heuristic. We sometimes see a blip in churn, and in some markets, we also see a marginal impact on acquisition. Often, these effects are transitory. It's sort of a change effect, and we move through it and win those folks back.\nI would say the big takeaway is the vast majority of our members recognize that we're investing what they pay us and the incremental amount that we're asking them to pay us into more entertainment value back to them, back to our members, more great stories, bigger films, more variety of content, and higher quality of programming. We generally plan to continue doing what we've been doing. I would also say we're also working hard to ensure that we have a range of price points across a set of plans with different features that deliver on different consumer needs and consumer desires, while making sure and being very focused that we retain good accessibility to the service for a broad group of people in every country we serve at sort of that entry level.\nNo major changes there, and we're keeping sort of the plan that we've got in place.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nOne more thing just.\nRelated.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nOh, go ahead, Reed. Sorry.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nRelated to that, Greg's done great work on the price spread. One way to increase the price spread is advertising on low-end plans and to have lower prices with advertising. Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription. As much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice. Allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising tolerant get what they want makes a lot of sense. That's something we're looking at now. We're trying to figure out over the next year or two. Think of us as quite open to offering even lower prices with advertising as a consumer choice. Spencer, you want to keep going?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nMy point was quite tactical. I'm sure Doug's going to want to follow up perhaps on your point. I just want to be really clear on the point on Q1 performance and what I talked about, slightly elevated churn relative to our expectations. That was not due to our price increases. The price increase played out, as Greg said, consistent with our expectations. We just saw some slight uptick in seasonality for the other reasons I mentioned, some of the strain in Central and Eastern Europe, some of that macro strain we saw, and maybe a little bit of competition on the margin.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Reed, you pulled me forward to advertising. I do want to get there. It was a little further down the list. One last point just on pricing. Given all these factors that you've talked about and written about in the letter, is there a change to your view on long-term pricing power?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI would say our general view is unchanged. Again, we do not have an a priori target in markets or whatever. We have been sort of finding our way through adding more value, keeping that virtuous cycle going, that big spread that Reed mentioned. Again, we are seeking ways to actually take that spread even wider. That is why I think ads is an exciting opportunity for us that we want to explore more. No fundamental shift in our thinking about how that process works or the potential that we have in that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. All right. Let's shift to ads.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nDoug, I would just add that that's directly related to creating the content that people find to be incredibly valuable. Our long-term view of our ability to continue to do that is unchanged. There's a long history of that across entertainment for decades, right, of people love film, TV, and games content. If we can continue to deliver that value, deliver that engagement, then there's a long history of people being willing to pay for it. As Reed said, also advertisers trying to reach those audiences. We believe we can kind of drive that value over time and then monetize it so long as we deliver on that entertainment value.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOn advertising, I think certainly, Reed, preserving the simplicity of the product has been very important. I think you've also kind of talked a little bit about, at least in the past, perhaps not seeing the incremental profit potential as well in terms of a lower-priced ad-supported tier. Has that view changed? I guess if you were to pursue an ad-based model on a lower tier, how long would it take you to get there and kind of roll that out? What are the key things you'd need to do along the way?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nYeah. It's not a short-term fix because once you start offering a lower-priced plan with ads as an option, some consumers take it. We've got a big installed base that probably are quite happy where they are. Think of it as it would phase in over a couple of years in terms of being material volume. In terms of the profit potential, definitely the online ad market has advanced. Now you don't have to incorporate all the information about people that you used to. We can be a straight publisher and have other people do all of the fancy ad matching and integrate all the data about people. We can stay out of that and really be focused on our members, creating that great experience. Again, getting monetized in a first-class way by a range of different companies who offer that service.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Is it fair to think that it would be something you would test in a few small markets to start out and then kind of move along?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nWe're probably not that advanced. I think it's pretty clear that it's working for Hulu. Disney's doing it. HBO did it. I don't think we have a lot of doubt that it works, that all those companies have figured it out. I'm sure we'll just get in and figure it out as opposed to test it and maybe do it or not do it. I think we'll really get in. It would be a plan layer like it is at Hulu. If you still want the ad-free option, you'll be able to have that as a consumer. If you'd rather pay a lower price and you're ad tolerant, that's also what we're going to cater to you also.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Let's shift gears to content. Ted, the Q2 slate includes a bunch of returning hit series like Elite, Ozark, Stranger Things, and Umbrella Academy. How are you thinking about that slate in Q2? Maybe if you could also talk a little bit more about the back half as well.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. They're proven brands for us, of course. Going into that, I'll start with Stranger Things because the new season of Stranger Things is a super-sized season. That's why we cut it in half. Each episode of the new season feels like a big feature film. It's really phenomenal. We're super excited about how it's landing creatively, and how excited fans are for it. I think that's going to be obviously the big story coming up later in the quarter. The finale of Ozark, which is one of Emmy Award-winning fan favorites, season three was a killer, and season four brings it home in a really incredible way. We're also wrapping up our longest-running show, Grace and Frankie, with an incredible final set of episodes coming up later this month that we're really excited about.\nWe've always said we ran through the COVID delays that had us backstack 2021. 2022 is not quite as backstacked, but it does build throughout the year, and it builds up to some of our big event films in Q4 that we're really excited about, like Knives Out 2, Gray Man coming up before that from the Russo Brothers, who we've had a lot of great success with, a really fantastic action movie with Ryan Gosling. The upcoming slate in 2022, we're confident, is better and more impactful than it was in 2021, and we think 2023 will be better and more impactful than 2022. Really, the content flow has been fantastic, and we're really excited about it.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust to follow up on, you mentioned.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI should say, obviously, not to forget our international content. Elite season five, as you know, continues a really great run for us there. We have a Korean version of Money Heist coming up called Money Heist Korea. That's really fantastic. New movie from Omar Sy, The Take Down from France, a great film from Germany, All Quiet on the Western Front, and a great slate of new content from Japan, Kubi vs. Love. We're really excited about the output from all of our international territories as well.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nTed, you mentioned splitting Stranger Things into different parts. You've done that with a number of series over the last few years. I guess as streaming proliferates, it feels like there's this increasing debate around the value and stickiness of providing a full season of content all at once. Just curious about how your thinking has evolved here, given that we are seeing more of these series kind of broken into two parts, essentially.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. Splitting the seasons actually had a practical reason before, which was the COVID delays and all those projects that kind of led us to splitting some of the seasons. What we found is that fans kind of liked both. Being able to split it gives them a really satisfying binge experience for those people who want that really satisfying long binge experience. Being able to deliver a follow-up season in a few months versus, in some cases, the new season of Stranger Things is coming nearly three years after the last one or more than two anyway. We are really being able to split the season when you can deliver both halves of it in a really high-quality way, like in the case of Ozark, had additional episodes. Both experiences were really satisfying for the binger or the one-at-a-time viewer as well.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWe've also had great success in these kind of mini batches of our unscripted shows. Doing one to three episodes a week every week has also been great, and still true to the binger by giving them more than one episode to watch at a time.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYou've talked about cash content spending of around $18 billion this year. In a period of slower subgrowth, are you more likely to pull back to manage costs, or to lean in to further differentiate the offering?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nLook, I think we've got to continue to invest in the content, both in the quality and the variety of the content. We will continue to grow the content spend relative to prior years. I think in general, we look at the most important though in there is the impact of the slate. We're very focused on making sure that the impact of the slate continues to grow. We should be able to, 10 years in now, get more bang for our buck relative to what we've done ourselves and relative to the market.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nYeah. Doug, to that point, obviously, the revenue growth has slowed. We're going to be responsible in terms of how we manage the business.\nWe talked about in the letter during this period of slower revenue growth, we're going to protect our operating margins roughly in line with what we guided to for this year. We're holding to our guidance for the full year 2022. Presumably for the next 18, 24 months, call it the next two years, we're kind of operating to roughly that operating margin, which does mean that we're pulling back on some of our spend growth across both content and non-content spend, but still growing our spend, and still investing aggressively into that long-term opportunity. We're trying to be smart about it, and prudent in terms of pulling back on some of that spend growth to reflect the realities of the revenue growth of the business.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust to clarify, only because you've been saying it for many years now, the 300 basis points kind of per year over a multi-year period, obviously, we were not going to see that this year. It sounds like over the next couple of years, you're thinking more flattish until you get subscribers really growing in a bigger way.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nWell, you get revenue growth again. Kind of revenue, engagement are going to be primary. We'll also get subscribers going. There will be subscriber growth, but primarily re-accelerating that revenue growth. We believe we have multiple levers to do that. We have high confidence in monetizing sharing, as we talked about. Reed talked about things like perhaps adding an advertising layer, and obviously continuing to improve the service, grow engagement, grow revenue. We have high confidence that we will accelerate revenue. When we do, we also have our commitment to continue to gradually grow our operating margins. Let's first get our revenue growth re-accelerated, and then let's talk about the pace of that margin acceleration.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nSpencer, what does all of that mean for free cash flow kind of near term? And then over the next couple of years, I mean, 2022 is certainly looked at as the first year of kind of sizable and sustainable free cash flow.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCPO, Netflix\n\nYeah. That continues. As I said, we're managing the business prudently for all of our stakeholders. We'll be positive free cash flow this year, consistent with our expectations going into the year. We'll continue to build on that in years going forward. That's our expectation. That's what we're still planning towards. I don't know, Spencer, if you would add to that maybe.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nNo, I think you hit it, but I'm ahead of Spence.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I wanted to talk about India a little bit. You cut prices significantly in December across plans. You've certainly pointed out that cable in India is around $3 a month. Just curious what the response has been like. Do you still view those changes as revenue accretive, and what are you seeing in terms of maybe early behavior from some of those incremental subscribers?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would say to your last point, the incremental subscribers are largely behaving similar to the subscribers we've added over the last 12 months. Not a fundamental difference. Really, this was a bet in terms of long-term revenue maximization, which is sort of how we think about the top-level valuatory model we have for these things. It was stimulated specifically by the fact that Ted's team is doing some incredible work on Indian content. We saw the slate there, and we're really excited about a bunch of titles that were coming down and thought there was an opportunity to broaden the audience that got to see those titles. We've seen that effect definitely take hold where we have an additional bump in subscribers that will now get to see that content.\nThe bet is that those folks will enjoy those titles, and that they will talk enthusiastically about those titles to their friends, their family, their coworkers. That'll lead to another sort of positive momentum on the flywheel of signups.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nTed, can you elaborate a little bit more just on the content in India? I guess just how you're thinking about kind of overall product fit at this point in the market.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. The product fit incorporates subscription prices as well, and willingness and ability to pay. We have seen a nice uptick in engagement in India. We're definitely taking it in the right direction.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I want to talk about gaming a little bit. I think, Reed, you've discussed it in the past as perhaps the next genre of content beyond TV and beyond film. I'm curious how you'd characterize your progress so far.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI'm really happy with what the team has built, a big capacity to be able to provide our members with interactive and gaming experiences. We've had some nice successes, which I'll let Greg talk about. I think we're building capacity, frankly, faster than we did when we entered film. That's very encouraging. Excited. You've seen we've been doing these small acquisitions to build up the know-how and the creative chops to be able to make some really great games.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. Just to pick it up, sorry, Doug, do you want to?\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI'm sure it's where you're going. I was just going to ask what the kind of puts and takes are around owning versus licensing IP, and what the appetite is for further M&A going forward.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nSure. We're open to both models. I would say we're very enthusiastic about building internal capacity. We're doing this both from sort of assembling it organically, as well as through acquisition, which is a key part of our strategy to be able to build the capacity to produce the games titles that we think are really going to unlock value for our members. We're learning more and more every day from the license titles that we've got, which is helpful. You can sort of, there's an early glimmer of where we're trying to head with this with the announcement we just recently did with a launch of both a game and an animated series around the Exploding Kittens IP.\nI don't know if you're familiar with this card game, but it's a super fun physical card game that we're now going to bring to form in both an animated series and a game. We'll have some interplay between these two different modes for fans of that IP. That's sort of an initial step on a long roadmap we have around thinking about how do we make the film and series side and then the interactive games experience, sort of the interplay between those, magnify the value that our members are getting from both. It's like a 1 plus 1 equals 3, and then hopefully 4, and then 5 situation. That's sort of the multi-year vision that we've got behind it.\nTo deliver on that, we think the internal development capacity is going to be key because we can obviously have those folks be very specifically focused on the opportunities that we see there.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nWhat are the benchmarks or milestones perhaps that you need to see around gaming to lean in even more here in terms of content budget? Are there any metrics or numbers that you can provide so far?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI can certainly provide the framework that we're thinking about. It's a top-level priority for us, and we're very focused on it. Bottom line, we think about games and delivering value to members and reflecting that back into the business through both acquisition. We're aiming to have titles that land, that create conversation, enthusiasm, and buzz that drive more people to sign up for the service. Obviously, in retention as well, engagement is that primary leading indicator that we have for retention and sort of value delivered. We're looking at both of those very, very carefully. Similar to how we think about it on the film and series side, we want to make sure the investment that we're making in any given title is sort of calibrated to that business value that we're getting out of it.\nWe're building our understanding of how those metrics work together so that we can have a good sort of fitness function around the work that we're doing, making sure that it's delivering value. That's really the go signs for us that we've got it figured out, and we want to ramp and scale the investment.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Ted, Netflix shares are back to pre-COVID levels, but they're also around the same level they were at nearly four years ago in 2018. If you could just talk about your ability to continue to hire great talent within the company.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI think that when people look to join Netflix, they join Netflix because they believe in this long-term vision of the move away from linear television and kind of transactional movie business into a business that could be much more satisfying for consumers, and deliver on the culture, and deliver big audiences, and really move the market. One of the things I'd say is by way of example is what we can do around the world. Our teams are on the ground. Our creative executives, our business executives are on the ground all over the world, are much more empowered. They're much more collaborative, and they're much more risk tolerant than their counterparts all over the world, which creates an ecosystem for something like Squid Game or for a Lupin or a La Casa de Papel to exist.\nOur ability to do that and to bring kind of global notoriety to local content players is unprecedented, and it's pretty unrivaled at this point. I think people look at that as something to be very exciting to be close to. At the long, long term, the long-term story is the broadband household penetration. We're going to get to those houses. There's a long-term and a short-term. In the short-term, you've got the highly penetrated users, and we're working through that right now. In the long-term, you've got things like smart TV sales and a bunch of macro factors that slow that down that we know that we all see that as temporary, including everyone who works at Netflix. Everyone really does see the long play. I know I've been here for more than 20 years and have been through a couple of these.\nYes, they don't feel great in the moment, but man, it feels great to come out on the other side of it. I think everyone is knowing that that's going to come up and will come out on the other side of it. Doug, we have time for two last questions, please.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I wanted to just back to content for a minute. You've driven a lot of attention to Formula 1 with Drive to Survive. Given the success there, sports is obviously a frequent topic. How are you thinking about sports? There's certainly more rumblings around doing things related to NFL, media, and NFL films. How are your intentions shifting, perhaps, here at all?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nWe expand our content verticals constantly. For us, I look at the games as a great example of adding something brand new to the service, something new for our members to enjoy. We're going down the game path because I think it fits us really nicely. Our ability to tell stories and build worlds is very consistent with our existing skill set and culture. We think that we can build a big revenue and profit stream by adding games. We're not quite so sure that you can add the big profit stream by adding sports. Other folks are trying it, and we're going down this other path. In the meantime, we're incredibly excited about, as you mentioned, the Formula 1 Drive to Survive as an example of kind of sports-adjacent programming that our members really value. We've grown the sport tremendously.\nWe're taking that bet in the world of tennis, golf, and others coming up. We also have an incredible sports documentary business that keeps growing. I'm not saying we never would do sports, but we'd have to see a path to growing a big revenue stream and a big profit stream with it.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Just to close out, Reed, you've created this very unique, very successful culture within the company over the past 20-plus years. Has anything changed in your view, just from a cultural perspective around either content acquisition or in some of the more operational functions?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I mean, we change every year, hopefully for the better. We don't look at culture as some fixed thing. We look at it as what's going to drive excellence. The North Star is getting excellence. We've made a bunch of adjustments as we've expanded around the world. We've made adjustments as we've become more original content-centric. We're always improving. The goal is excellence, and then a culture is a tactic in that journey.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you all.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nGreat. Ted, did you want to close us out?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nHey, can I say one thing before they close us out, just a tactical thing? One tactical thing that I should have mentioned earlier, Doug, I just want to make sure there's not a read-through. We guide to negative 2 million paid net adds in Q2. We didn't talk about full year and what we expect. We're not providing full-year guidance, Doug, but I just want to make sure there's not a read-through from negative 2 million paid net adds in Q2 that there's going to be a steady trip down of negative adds. We're not expecting our growth to re-accelerate, our revenue growth to re-accelerate before the end of the year, but we will grow revenue, and there will be paid net add growth. As we get to the back half of the year, Ted talked about the stronger slate.\nWe get further away from some of the big price increases, we get into a stronger seasonal period. I just want to make sure that that's understood as you think about the full year, even though we're not providing full-year guidance. Sorry, just we didn't get to it.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCPO, Netflix\n\nIt's always good to provide that non-guidance guidance. When we look at the last 20 years, like Ted mentioned, we've gone through a lot of changes, and we've always figured them out one by one. It's super exciting. We're going to figure this one out. We got a great team. We lead by a significant margin in streaming, and streaming is continuing to grow around the world. We have a bunch of opportunity to improve. Coming out the other side, I'm pretty sure we'll look at this as really foundational in our continued journey. Over to you, Ted.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. That's well said, Reed. I would only add that a reminder to folks is that as we keep talking about competition, to remind you that we've always had really tough competition. All the players who compete with us today have been competing with us since our first day of streaming, some head-to-head and some through their legacy business models, and they're now migrating to be more head-to-head players while they're struggling to manage their legacy businesses. I really like the competitive position that we're in. I love the competitive position that we are moving from relative than just a couple of years ago. In every metric that we measure success, engagement, revenue, subscribers, profit, all of those ways that we're measuring, I think I like the competitive position that we're coming at it from.\nI want to just assure everybody that everyone at Netflix shares that excitement to come out the other side of this part of the business. With that, I just encourage you to enjoy the final episodes of our incredible show, Ozark, and our longest-running comedy show, Grace and Frankie, coming up at the end of the month, and an incredible slate of films and series coming up in 2022. Thanks.",

Joining me today are co-CEO Reed Hastings, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, COO and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters, and CFO Spencer Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Nidhi Gupta from Fidelity. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. Nidhi, over to you now to kick off the Q&A.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nThank you, Spencer. Good to be with you all again. Great to see all the new content over the quarter. I've been a little less productive, so I think I can blame you all for that. As usual, I'd like to start with net adds during the quarter, which came in a little bit lighter than you expected. Just help us understand the underperformance there.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNidhi, 8.3 versus 8.5? I mean, you know, that's incredible.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nOn 222 million.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nIn fairness, Nidhi said it was a little shy, so I'll take it, Nidhi. As I said, we delivered first, we're quite pleased with how the quarter played out. We delivered 8.3 million paid net adds, so it was just a bit shy, about a tenth of a percent on roughly 222 million paying members. Overall, we're quite pleased with how our titles performed. We had big viewing. We started the quarter with Squid Game becoming a global phenomenon, and we ended the quarter in December with big TV series like the finale of La Casa de Papel, a big returning show, and The Witcher, our two biggest movie releases of all time. Overall, the business was healthy.\nRetention was strong, churn was down, viewing was up. On the margin, we didn't grow acquisition quite as fast as we would have liked to see. On our large subscriber base, a small change in acquisition can have a pretty big flow-through in paid net adds. Again, our acquisition was growing, just not growing quite as fast as we were perhaps hoping or forecasting.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGreat. As we look ahead to Q1, the guidance was a bit below kind of what was expected and what you've done in previous Q1s. Maybe just help us understand what some of the key considerations were that went into the guidance. Does it raise any concerns for you about anything structural, whether it's competition or saturation, or does it give you any pause in terms of sort of your return on content spend?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSure. No structural change in the business that we see. What's reflected in the guidance, we guided to 2.5 million paid net adds in Q1. What's reflected there is pretty much the same trends we saw in Q4. Healthy retention with churn down, healthy viewing and engagement with viewing up, and acquisition just growing but a bit slower than pre-COVID levels. Just hasn't fully recovered. We're trying to pinpoint what that is. It's tough to say exactly why our acquisition hasn't kind of recovered to pre-COVID levels. It's probably a bit of just overall COVID overhang that's still happening after two years of a global pandemic that we're still, unfortunately, not fully out of.\nSome macroeconomic strain in some parts of the world, like Latin America in particular. While we can't pinpoint or point a straight line when we look at the data on a competitive impact, there may be some kind of more on the marginal kind of side of our growth, some impact from competition, but again, we just don't see it specifically. Overall, that's what's reflected in the guide. I'd say our big titles are also landing, at least our known big titles, a little bit later in the quarter with season two of Bridgerton in March, The Adam Project also in March.\nI should note we also, while we are changing prices in countries every quarter, in Q1 of this year, it happens to be our largest country, as we announced last week, and actually our largest region with Canada as well. That's probably a little bit more impact than a typical quarter.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNidhi, you're right to reflect on two years ago, we were 10 million above plan, which was a shock. Last year, we were 10 million below or 9 million, and so the pull forward sort of makes it hard to read. In the prior years, we were very steady, so we could have confidence on incremental trends. As Spencer said, when we reflect, of course, hey, that's a low guide, and we think it'll be accurate. It's not sandbagged at all. Kind of what's going on. There's a number of potential explanations in COVID, but then we worry about hanging too much on that.\nThere's more competition than there's ever been. We've had Hulu and Amazon for 14 years, so it doesn't feel like any qualitative change there. Overall, confidence in streaming becomes all of entertainment. Linear dissipates over the next 10 to 20 years. Very high confidence in that thesis because everyone's coming into streaming. Market size, very large. Our execution is steady and getting better. For now, we're just staying calm and trying to figure out. Again, COVID has introduced so much noise. It just wants us to give it some pause as we work on everything we've always worked on.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nJust to reiterate, I'd say we took a big bet years ago on this that people would move on to Netflix and Netflix-type offerings to consume movies and film. That was a big, big bet that we've seen continue to go through. We have no change in our confidence in that. I think what's really been great about 2021, even through all those conditions, we were able to kind of prove out two other theses that we've bet on starting years ago. One big one around our investment in international programming. We're glad that we started that seven years ago with Club de Cuervos. Now we were betting that you could take films and series from anywhere in the world and entertain the entire world.\nWe were getting bigger and bigger milestones against that goal. We have proven to have kind of global sensations from France with Lupin, from Spain with La Casa de Papel, and Elite. In the biggest way possible in 2021 was Squid Game, which has become our biggest series ever. It is unapologetically and perfectly Korean. It is not built to be this kind of global thing. It is proving that great storytelling from anywhere in the world can entertain the world. Our other big bet was our investment in big-budget feature films and our bet that we could effectively release them and compete with big theatrical releases for audience and for attention.\nRed Notice this year, of course, and Don't Look Up have become our number one and number two most-watched movies ever on Netflix. If you look at the hours that we publish out, you could do the math and back into it. They may be the most-watched movies anywhere in the world this year. I think those two bets coming true, it kind of strengthens our confidence in the overall bet in the service, pleasing customers, and leaning into consumer-first business models that we could succeed there.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nYeah. No, I think that's part of the question, right? I mean, this was probably the best content quarter you've had. Looking at sort of flattish subs versus previous Q4s, obviously a great number, but it's kind of in line with what you've done the last few Q4s. What do you read from that? Is the customer's sort of hurdle just higher in terms of the amount and quality of content that you need to deliver to get the same number of net adds?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nWell, I think what Spencer was saying, we didn't see it in engagement. We didn't see it hit to our engagement. We didn't see it hit to retention, all those things that would classically lead you to looking at competition. It's a stew of all those things. Not only are we in a pandemic, we've kind of come in of and out of COVID at different levels in 2021, particularly the back half of 2021. It's created a lot of bumpiness, certainly, and not steady linear growth, which makes it a little tougher to predict. All the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGot it. You announced a US price increase last week. Maybe just help us understand kind of over what timeframe you think this will flow through, what kind of churn you might expect.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nYeah, I'd say you can anticipate it flowing through over the next quarter, the quarter that we're in right now, Q1. We largely are seeing in the price changes that we've done most recently and for the earliest indications that we have in the US, which are still premature because we actually haven't actually rolled it out to any customers yet.\nWhat we've seen over the last couple of years, which is that sort of core theory that we have, is that if we've done a good job investing the members' subscription fees that they've paid us into better stories, more great storytelling, bigger movies, more variety, then when we come back and ask them occasionally for a little bit more to keep that sort of cycle going, they're generally willing to do that. We don't see any significant disruption to the business otherwise in that regard.\nI would say, generally, when we look at that sort of core theory and we look at also the competitors, if you look at Disney+ as an example, other streaming services out there as well, and their ability to grow even as we've been growing as well, I think it's really strong endorsement for the core idea that consumers around the world are willing to pay for great entertainment. It encourages us to continue that investment, to try and deliver more entertainment value, and earn more of that share.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nYeah, no, it's a good point about your streaming competitors. When I look at sort of your steady price increases in the US, it doesn't seem like you feel too constrained by where those competitors are priced. Is that a true statement? I guess as long as your viewing share is sort of multiples of any other streaming service in the US, should we think about your price relative to cable actually as we sort of think about your runway? Not that you'll get there overnight, but as we think about your runway, is that really sort of the comparison we should be thinking about as opposed to other streaming services?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nYeah, we don't have an a priori sort of price target in any given country that we're tracking to. Mostly, we're listening to our members and sort of iteratively doing this walk where the metrics that we see in terms of engagement, churn, and acquisition, and those kind of things are really our signal that we've done a good job at sort of creating this more value. It's the right time to ask for a little bit more to keep that going. To the previous comments around competition and things like that, we don't think that it's an immediately replaceable or substitutable good, let's say, right?\nIf we have incredible stories, movies that you can only see on Netflix, great TV shows, unscripted, now games coming, that really, the value equation for any given member or member-to-be in a market is just, are they getting good value for what they're paying? As long as we do a good job there, we feel like we're fulfilling that need.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGreat. You also made a price change in India in the other direction. Maybe just help us understand what you're trying to achieve with that price change.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I think it follows a whole set of activities that we've been doing in India over the years that we've been operating there and learning more about Indian consumers' tastes, etc. That's broadening the offering in the service across many, many different dimensions. Obviously, at the core is the content and the programming, and seeking to expand that and provide an increased variety and range of programming that appeals and is attractive to more people in India. While we're thinking about go-to-market and the partnerships that we have, making sure that we're available with those partners at that place where more people in India will find us, it gets to payments and many, many, many things.\nWhen we looked at it and we saw sort of the sum total of all those activities, we felt it was the right time to decrease our prices there to increase accessibility to all of those incremental value or features that we've been trying to deliver to the market to more Indian consumers. We also wanted to do it not just like we did with mobile, which is a good lower entry price point, but do it across the range of plans that we had under the theory that some of those features, like the ability to watch on TV with the basic plan, really unlocks more value in the service and therefore would create more retention, more attractiveness to those plan types for those Indian consumers.\nWe're doing this through the lens of what's the long-term sort of revenue maximization, our best guess at that exchange. In this case, we basically anticipated that while we decrease ARM, average revenue per member, as a result of the price decreases, we're going to make it up in more subscriber ads. I would say it's still very early in looking at India. Some of these effects, like retention, take a couple of months to get a very clean read on it. The early data that we are seeing very much supports a positive read on that lens of revenue maximization through these changes.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nNidhi, as you well know, but not all viewers might know, what's unique about India's cable is about $3 per month per household. So, radically different pricing than the rest of the world, which does impact consumer expectations.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nRight. If this approach doesn't give you the desired result, and it sounds like it is so far, but if fast forward six months or 12 months from now, it isn't giving you the desired result, would you consider sort of right-sizing your content spend in India or maybe consider an ad-supported model? I guess in other words, how hard do you want to push for India? Are there examples of success you see either in the media industry or outside of it that give you the confidence that you can make money in this market long-term?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI think it would be a long time before we adjusted materially because our experience in Brazil was brutal for the first couple of years. We thought we'd never break even. Now we've got this great business. Greg, why don't you talk about the experience in Japan?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I would use the word brutal in my mind, my back to that. Obviously, it's a different country, different characteristics in terms of affluence, things like that. It took us quite a while to unlock all of these components, product-market fit, get the right content, all these different pieces. Once you get that sort of flywheel spinning, it's been an incredible market for us and a source of tremendous growth in membership and revenue in the region. I think we're quite bullish that India isn't fundamentally different in some way that we can't figure out how to tailor our service offering to be attractive to Indian consumers who love entertainment.\nWe know that for sure. That, I think, gives us a lot of optimism to continue to work our way at it.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nI would just add.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nSorry, go ahead, Reed.\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nThe great news is in every single other major market, we've got the flywheel spinning. The thing that frustrates us is, why haven't we been as successful in India? We're definitely leading in there.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nThere wasn't an easy one in the bunch. Well, that's kind of what I was going to say with Ted, touchdown. For as much as we have what we believe is a terrific business and terrific business model that scales so well with content that can be created anywhere and travel everywhere, and you see that with our more than 222 million paying members around the world, it's also super hard. It's hard in every country. Every country is on a different adoption curve. We talk about product-market fit, but even though everyone loves film and TV and even games, it is very specific. Entertainment is still fundamentally pretty local around the world.\nIt's global and local, and we need to figure that out. That is actually a good thing about our business, that it scales well, but it's also super difficult. Otherwise, it'd be really easy for everybody to replicate it.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nIt seemed going into producing original content in India being pretty almost impossible when we first started looking at it. This quarter alone, we've got original content coming out from Turkey. We're in production in Russia, from Argentina, from Mexico, from Sweden, from Denmark. We've got original content coming from all corners of the world. We have 20 originals coming out of Korea this year. The idea of they invested in this early and have built up on it, and that it really is going to be something that it's going to start to, we think it will start flowering in India for all the same reasons: a good product-market fit, content people love, value that fits with their life, and product they can't live without.\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nI'll triple down on that point as well, Teddy, because I mean, we're still learning even now as we have these incredible stories from all these different places around the world how to bring them to that global audience in increasingly effective ways. It's simple things, obviously, like subtitling and dubbing. We've subtitled 7 million runtime minutes in 2021 and dubbed 5 million runtime minutes. At that scale, we're learning actually how to do that better and how to make that localization more compelling to our members. It also gets to even things that you wouldn't even anticipate, like how you present these titles in an emotionally evocative way.\nWe describe a story maybe as nostalgic or eerie, and that means something to us, but you can't just literally translate that. You have to find out in every culture and language around the world what is that similarly emotionally evocative descriptor that is going to communicate really easily and quickly what a story means. There's so much work and incredibly fascinating things that we're learning about how to do that every day.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nIn many of those places where we built that out, there was zero infrastructure for subtitling and dubbing.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nWell, speaking of content that travels well, South Korea, as you mentioned, Ted, has been a really bright spot for you. As you said, you're launching over 20 new shows there this year. What are sort of the unique factors that drove your success in South Korea? More importantly, what do you think the adoption curve can look like here relative to maybe what you've seen in other markets?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI'd say first and foremost, we've developed over the years an incredible team in South Korea that has worked with the talent community that recognized the storytelling that really works in Korea, that didn't try to make it different so it would travel, but really tried to find all the things about Korean cinema and Korean drama and build them up in a way that people could see kind of new levels of production value. It's not like we had to go in and teach anyone in South Korea how to make great content. It's an incredible market for that. There's always been curiosity around the world. The K-drama market has always had little pockets of success all over the place.\nI think the ease of delivery that we've offered has kind of pushed that into the mainstream. Yes, there was a kind of a turning point with Parasite and Bong Joon-ho's Oscar last year that kind of opened up people's minds to it. We saw that even way before that with Okja working with director Bong, that there was this incredible storytelling culture that we could tap into and that people would love K-dramas and watch them all over the world.\nIt just was not that easy to find them. In Netflix, we have been able to kind of put together the great storytelling, great delivery, and a great value proposition that has grown the watching of Korean content in the US to numbers I would have never believed three years ago. 100% growth in 2021 over 2020.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nWill we get a second season of Squid Game?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nAbsolutely. The Squid Game universe has just begun.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGreat. Looking forward to that. Shifting gears to Latin America, this region feels like it's maturing at a lower level of penetration than you've seen in the US. Is that due to competition, affordability, account sharing, or something else? Maybe you disagree with the statement that it's actually maturing. Help us understand if there's anything you can do differently to sort of drive penetration levels there higher.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nWell, first, I just wouldn't necessarily read through that it's maturing faster, Nidhi. I mean, again, I just don't want to understate the impact of what we've been going through for the last two years. Latin America, in particular, has been more strained. It's had less kind of government funding and subsidization relative to many parts of the world to kind of fuel their economy. On top of that, we also continue to increase prices in that market last year across some big countries for us: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina. Between macroeconomic factors and general strain, the business is still growing there.\nWe grew by about 2.5 million members last year, so under the kind of pre-COVID growth rates, but still growing. It is a market where pay TV is healthy. Folks love film and TV, and so I think there's a long runway of growth there. It's also been a great market for us for Spanish-language content that we're creating for the rest of the world. We don't see others can chime in need to change strategy. We continue, like we talked about with India. We're getting better everywhere every year. We're getting better with our local content in Brazil, Mexico, and so forth. There's a lot more to come, but it's not a fundamental change in strategy.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nThat makes sense. Maybe just stepping back, you've talked about 800 to 900 million homes globally outside of China. That's sort of your TAM, you call it 25% penetrated into that. As you're seeing how various markets are playing out in terms of penetration levels, some higher, some lower, obviously, they're all still growing. Has your thought process changed at all on how many of these 800 to 900 million homes you can have ultimately or sort of the timeframe to get there, whether it's higher than you expected or lower than you expected? How might you actually evolve your content strategy or your pricing strategy to get the next 200 million subscribers?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nYeah. I'd say, Nidhi, on that pay TV comparison, we look at it. We're in the US at about two-thirds of the pay TV high watermark. The back third is definitely going to be harder than the first two-thirds in terms of appealing, more unscripted, more superhero. We're working on all of that. Because we don't have sports and news, you might say, well, if we get to 80% or something of pay TV, that's a good accomplishment. Also, streaming TV is such a better experience than the old linear TV. In some ways, we think to ourself, we should be higher than pay TV, a combination of lower pricing and better experience. Definitely frustrating for us, the current slower growth.\nThat's why it could well be kind of just COVID effects, or it could be as you're pushing on a smaller market than we thought, but I'm not sure why. We try to be really rigorous of thinking about the long term. It's possible that we'll get there, but slower than we thought, smart TV adoption, complexity, those kinds of things. We're still focused on the original thesis of if we become incredibly compelling, everyone's going to want to be a Netflix member.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI know it feels like we've been saying it for a long time, but it's early days. It really is. I think about the evolving value proposition and how it's still maturing. The idea that big ticket movies that people really care about premiering and being part of your Netflix subscription is actually taking the value proposition to a new level than it was just a couple of years ago. I do think, like I said, it's a dynamic market for sure. It may not be as steady as people can think about it in terms of we're going to add X number every month, every quarter, every week. There's no question that that's the direction the business is going in.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nYeah. Ted, that's a good segue to where I wanted to go next. You had an incredible lineup of films in Q4 with a lot of viewing. I'm curious, what did having a strong film slate in the quarter do for you relative to periods where you didn't have that? Did you see more aggregate engagement, lower churn, more conversation? Just what was sort of unique about delighting your customers with a film versus a show in terms of kind of the benefits that you see?\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. There's a big theory, which is that people differently value movies because they always have to pay for it. You have to buy a movie ticket, you have to buy a pay-per-view transaction or a DVD. There's always a kind of a transactional, and a pretty big one for some people, to see a big movie premiere in your home. There was this kind of temporary effect that some other folks were doing. This is in our permanent model to premiere our big movies on the service. I think people, even if you really watch mostly television, you have a movie night, and we can service you on movie night.\nI think that's a very big, important value proposition that we have that's different from everybody else, and that these are the movies that people really love and care about. You start seeing them at the scale of Don't Look Up and Red Notice in Q4, and it gets you just super excited as to what could be next, when what's coming next. For that, we have things like The Adam Project coming up with Ryan Reynolds and Shawn Levy directed, coming up in Q1. It's a phenomenal movie for the whole family. We have a big action movie from the Russo brothers, like The Gray Man with Ryan Gosling, Knives Out 2, and Enola Holmes 2.\nWe have this movie lineup that any one studio would kill for any one season. We've got new movies every week on Netflix, and they're big movies that people care about. We think once that expectation is set, and we keep delivering on it, people will react to that too.\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nNidhi, I just add that at the core, what our members love and what they tell us they love is a great variety of high-quality content. That means across TV, film, and hopefully games over time in a much broader way. Having a great film offering is, for us, a key part of that equation. I think we're just starting to fulfill more and more of that, our member kind of needs and wants and satisfaction. That's what we're seeing. It's not like it's just so differential than something else. It's part of that overall quality and variety of entertainment offering.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nI also think it differentially serves people watching together. It's much easier to watch a movie together than to make sure you're all tracking on the same episode every week if you travel or whatever you do. That kind of together experience we can deliver on every weekend on Netflix is pretty great. I think about even just in the upcoming quarter alone, talking about variety, everyone has very different taste. Any one movie is only going to serve a segment of the audience. Now you get big, exciting things like Don't Look Up and Red Notice, you can get to a big chunk of the base, but you're still only getting to about 60%.\nTo serve everyone, you have to have a big variety of output. It does seem like a lot of volume, but it's not all for you. In Q1 alone, we have The Adam Project I mentioned, Munich from Germany, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is kind of a reinvention of that franchise, Tall Girl 2, which is a sequel to one of our big YA rom-coms, Home Team with Kevin James, Judd Apatow's new movie, The Bubble. That's all in Q1, plus original local language films from all over the world as well. To meet the kind of variety of taste, we're able to really step up and deliver no matter what that taste is.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nYeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Reed, you talked in the Q3 call about sort of over time building out the whole experience of games, consumer products, live events, etc., around some of your IP. It obviously starts with great IP and great storytelling. What else do you have to get right operationally and strategically to really build a franchise? Do you feel like you have the pieces in place now?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWe're building those muscles steadily with our consumer products, both like the Squid Game tracksuits. We're making a big push on experiences that are mobile and portable, and people, if we can set them up quickly, and developing that muscle. Obviously, the gaming muscle we're very young on and building. If you think of a world in a few years where those are strong muscles, and then you think of the next Bridgerton or Squid Game coming through, that's when we hope to be able to really pull those pieces together. People talk about franchise like it's zero or one.\nOf course, there's a complete continuum that will add value in the short term to our various titles. We're doing that already through the consumer products world and having people feel a bigger connection to those big franchises. It's already working, but it's probably, I don't know, 20% of what it will be in a couple of years in terms of the auxiliary boost beyond just the title.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nYeah. I'd say on that continuum, Reed, you've got Stranger Things, which I'd say is as valuable a franchise as exists today in entertainment around the world. We certainly have things that are in the early stages of becoming a franchise like Bridgerton, which we launched our second season of, this, our second most popular show ever in Q1. We're also, this year, you'll see an origin story on Queen Charlotte, and these incredible Bridgerton live experiences around the country and around the world that fans will flock to and flood their social media feeds with.\nThere's consumer products that go along with that as well. It's all those kind of makings of a franchise. Instead of trying to tap into one that's been building for 50 years, can you build it from whole cloth? I think Stranger Things is a proof point that you can.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nWe touched on gaming a little bit. It's very exciting to see some worldwide launches during the quarter. Greg, I know it's early days, what has sort of the reception and engagement been from the subscriber base? What have your learnings been as well?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nYeah. As you say, it's tremendously exciting to get to this point because we basically have been building the plumbing and all the technical infrastructure just to get to the point where we can do this, which is consistently launch games globally to all of our members. It's great to do that. Now, as you point out, we're really getting to learn from all those games. What are the discovery patterns? What are the engagement patterns? How are they performing? What do our members want from games on the service? It's still very early days.\nGenerally, what we're seeing is, not surprisingly, we have a growing number of monthly active users and daily active users on these games. We're generally seeing good growth in that regard. Really, as we're doing this, we've been building in parallel what I'm super excited about, which is this sort of internal development capacity, our own game studio. We've been hiring some incredible talent that brings a set of experience to this process. We've done an acquisition in this space.\nThat now allows us to incrementally, gradually, over a period of time, get to that sort of the value that you and Reed were talking about, where we get to deliver now interactive experiences that are tied to the IP that we're excited about, that are timed with that. That, I think, is really when you're going to see a next level of unlock around the value we can deliver to members.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGiven that gamers tend to sort of consolidate their time around a smaller number of titles compared to video, where we tend to consume a wider variety of content, would it be more efficient to sort of buy your way into some well-known titles to sort of anchor the product? Just the last couple of weeks, we've obviously seen a couple of major companies make big acquisitions or at least announce big acquisitions because this is obviously something that's difficult to build organically. I'm just curious what your reaction to that is and why isn't Netflix participating in big acquisitions given your aspirations in gaming?\n\nGreg Peters\n\nCOO and CPO, Netflix\n\nWell, it was exciting to see the activity in the space. I think to some degree, it's an endorsement of the core thesis that we have around subscription being a great model to connect consumers around the world with games and game experiences. We're open to licensing, accessing large game IP that people will recognize. I think you'll see some of that happen over the year to come. We also see, back to Ted's like, building out a whole cloth and the ability to sort of take the franchises or the big titles, let's call it, that we are excited about and actually develop interactive experiences that are connected to those.\nWe see a huge long-term, multi-year opportunity in that too. We're very open. We're going to be experimental and try a bunch of things. I would say the eyes that we have on the long-term prize really center more around our ability to create properties that are connected to the universes, the characters, the stories that we're building in other places, and sort of magnify that value for the fans of those stories.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nHey, Nidhi, we have time for two more questions.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nOkay. Maybe, Reed, just a bigger picture question for you. Spencer, I might have more than a couple of questions. You have this global subscription product that's inside sort of hundreds of millions of households around the world. You've really nailed the lean-back content. There's this whole world of interactive or semi-interactive content, whether it's gaming, fitness, or education. At the more extreme end, there's VR content. Now everyone's talking about the metaverse. You've obviously already gotten going on gaming. As you look at this broad spectrum of content, how much of it do you want to wrap your subscription around, thinking about the long term?\n\nReed Hastings\n\nCo-CEO, Netflix\n\nWhen you say how much do you want to, that would be a high number. We have to be differentially great at it. There's no point in just being in it. That's very dilutive of the whole proposition. It took us several years to get great at English original series. You saw in the letter on Google Search Trends how well we did there. We built, with a lot of effort, a really strong film franchise. Ted calls it just the third inning. It's like we're really just getting going to what we think we're going to be able to do there. Of course, we've got all the international content, we've got unscripted documentaries, and then gaming, which initially we're focused on, the mobile gaming is a big one.\nI would say when mobile gaming is world-leading and we're some of the best producers and where we are in film today, two of the top 10 for our gaming, then you should ask, okay, what's next? We're definitely crawl, walk, run. Let's nail the thing and not just be in it for the sake of being in it or for a press release. We got to please our members by having the absolute best in the category. Ted and Greg have been doing a terrific job on that, and we'll just continue to work on that. Queue it up for that. When we're winning in games, then we'll take the question.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGreat. Spence, just turning over to you on margins. Does the guidance for a lower level of margin—and you gave a lot of explanation around that in the letter—but outside of sort of the FX impact, does it have more to do with some of these incremental investments we're talking about, like games, and perhaps consumer products? Or does it have more to do with sort of the lower level of revenue growth that you're expecting?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nNo, it's really just FX, Nidhi. As we said in the letter, we lost about $1 billion of expected revenue in 2022 through FX. That's about 2 points of margin. If you just kind of look at our guide and add that back on, we're right on our pace of adding about 3 points of margin per year. Can't forget, we were over-delivering on margin the last couple of years. That's really all that's happening here. The FX move happened in really the last six months of last year. What we've always said is we don't want to swing the business unnecessarily fast. We want to be able to invest in a healthy way into our growth opportunity.\nOver time, we will then right-size appropriately our investment levels, our cost structure, our pricing in order to right-size for where the currencies are coming in. This gives us some time to do it. It gives us a little time. We will catch back up. We're still committed to roughly average of three points of margin increase over any few-year period. There's no change there. We've been factoring in our content investment, our games investment all along. I just want to say in our growth too, we talk a lot about this deceleration. Obviously, we'd like to grow faster, but there's still very healthy growth in this business.\nWhat you're seeing in we ended the year last year with 19% growth year-over-year. What you see in the guide is 10% revenue growth for Q1. That's a bit misleading again because of FX. There's about 4 points of drag in our revenue in Q1. What I would argue, FX-adjusted constant currency for Q1 year-over-year is about 14% growth. It's also a tough comp year-over-year in Q1 because you may remember we increased prices in the US in Q4 of 2020, which flowed through to Q1 of 2021 when it was really materialized. The year-over-year comp is tough.\nThe underlying organic revenue growth in the business is right now, at least in Q1, more like 15%, plus 15, 16, 17%. That's at least just in the quarter. That's still very healthy underlying growth in the business. I don't want to dismiss that. We'd love to be growing faster. We'd love to not have the negative FX swings, but it's still very healthy growth in the business.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nGreat.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nNidhi, since it's your last earnings interview, I will grant you one extra question.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nThank you. I'll have one.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nYou get that.\n\nNidhi Gupta\n\nPortfolio Manager, Fidelity\n\nI have one last question. This will be the last one. It's also for Spence. It's very exciting that you'll become sustainably free cash flow positive this year. Congratulations on reaching this milestone. I feel like I've been waiting 10 years to ask this question. How will you balance M&A and buybacks with your free cash flow? Maybe sort of related to that, have we peaked in terms of that ratio of cash content spent to amortization? How long will it take for earnings and free cash flow to kind of converge?\n\nSpencer Neumann\n\nCFO, Netflix\n\nCan't believe you wanted to end with me, Nidhi. There are so many more exciting people to speak with on the call. We appreciate what you said there. It is a big milestone for us to be cash flow positive going forward. We're excited for that. The business model has been proving out. That's great in terms of our increasing profits, profit margins over time, as well as cash. In terms of use of cash, and Spencer, you can chime in too. As we've talked about in prior calls, our top priority is to be responsible stewards of the business and our cash, but to invest in the healthy growth of our business, and strategically invest in the business first organically.\nIf there's been opportunistically M&A, M&A is not the strategy for us per se. M&A is a tactic to accelerate our strategy, whether it's to accelerate our content capabilities and capacity or just acquisition of IP like Dahl across film, TV, and games, as you've seen. What's left over after that, we're not going to sit on excess cash, as we've said. Our capital allocation plan is as it's been, which is to have roughly two months of revenue in the form of cash on our balance sheet. Excess beyond that will return to shareholders opportunistically, as we have done. We did that to the tune of about $600 million last year in share repurchase, and we're authorized up to $5 billion share repurchase.\nThat's still our plan. In terms of when those ratios converge and earnings and cash flow look the same, I don't want to put a prediction out there. We're still very much in growth mode as a business. It will continue to converge over time. I don't want to declare a specific peak. It's been going in the right direction over a multi-year period, and it'll continue to do so.\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nThe only thing I would add to that, Nidhi, is just on the capital allocation part, just to remind you, our balance sheet target is for gross debt of about $10 to 15 billion. We ended the quarter slightly above the $15 billion mark. As we said in the letter, we will be paying down about $700 million in Q1. Obviously, delivering a bit is something you should anticipate in terms of use of cash.\nJust lastly, on the EPS free cash flow questions, just want to remind you there are some below-the-line items, like the non-cash remeasurement of our eurobonds, that can skew EPS in any sort of given quarter. Just a call out there. Thank you for your questions. I'm going to turn it over to Ted now for his closing remarks and to take us home.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nNidhi, thank you so much for these. Thanks for today. The love of film, TV, and games has built big businesses for people who can figure out what people love, build a creative environment that creators know how to feed, and then deliver it to fans with a value proposition that they appreciate. I think those fans are positively moving from old linear models and transactional models to more fan-friendly subscription services that are with high-quality programming, delivered well, with great value. That's absolutely happening. It's happening all over the world.\nThe pace of the migration may be a little hard to call from time to time when there are kind of varied global events or even local conditions. It's absolutely happening. There's no question of that. Films that you love, series that you define yourself by, and games that thrill you, that's a pretty great business. We're thrilled to be in it. We're also planning to continue to improve what we're doing, to grow this by growing revenue, by growing profits, and by growing audience affinity around the world. Once again, Nidhi, if I could see you in person, I'd give you this. I've got two of them. Where's the other one?\n\nSpencer Wang\n\nVP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development, Netflix\n\nTed, I found one for you.\n\nTed Sarandos\n\nCo-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nThank you, Nidhi.",

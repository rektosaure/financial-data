I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 results, manage expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks, it's available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filing. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe had a monumental third quarter shattering expectations yet again. Our overall revenue grew 63% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. We outperformed across the board, driven by strong execution in the U.S. which accounted for 3/4 of our business in Q3, growing 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Our Rule of 40 score soared to an unprecedented 114, up 4 points year-over-year and a full 20 points since last quarter alone, reinforcing our position as the defining enterprise software company of our generation.\nOur U.S. commercial business grew an incredible 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially, driven both by insatiable demand and the quantified exceptionalism compelling customers to scale AIP across their operations. Organizations are embracing an undeniable truth. -- real enterprise AI at scale requires Palantir. We're seeing that AIP again and again, is the only platform delivering transformational impact in this market. And critically, AIP is the only AI platform that has an actual plan for compounding your enterprises AI leverage, not just the model makers leverage over you. Sharing this leverage with our customers is our highest priority. Our whole company is singularly focused around value creation for our customers, and I'm proud to share with you all the fruits of our labor.\nWe closed our highest TCV quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Underlying this performance, we closed a staggering 204 deals worth $1 million or more of which 91 deals were worth $5 million or more and 53 deals were worth $10 million or more. In our U.S. commercial business, which now accounts for 34% of our overall revenue. We closed $1.3 billion in TCV, a milestone achievement for the fastest-growing area of our business with a more than 6x year-over-year growth rate on a dollar-weighted duration basis. The trajectory is clear. customers are converting to larger enterprise agreements in short time frames, reflecting both the expanding scope of their AI ambitions and the immediate impact our software delivers.\nA leading medical device manufacturer signed a multiyear expansion just 5 months after their initial contract, increasing ACV more than eightfold. 2 weeks into their initial contract, the conversation evolved from a single use case to pursuing the opportunity of becoming an AI-first enterprise. Their CEO approached me to embrace a shared vision for an enterprise-wide AIP deployment to transform their entire organization. This transformation reflects a broader pattern we're seeing across our customer base. AI is a strategic imperative owned at the C-suite level with executive leaders recognizing the enterprise-wide AI adoption is the defining factor separating the AI haves and the AI have-nots.\nWe're seeing C-suite-driven AI transformations across our customers. At a leading insurance company, the CEO has taken personal ownership of their AI transformation, meeting with our team regularly to orchestrate a company-wide transformation around AIP, reimagining every function from underwriting to claims processing, leading to a significant expansion of our work together. Our partnership with TWG Global named virgin.ai continues to gain momentum as TWG's Thomas Toll noted \"what was once a competitive advantage is now a competitive necessity.\" Companies that fail to incorporate AI into their core operations will be outpaced by those that do. These examples underscore what we are seeing. We are the only platform bringing true transformational impact to the enterprise AI market.\nTurning to our U.S. government business. Revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially as we continue to deliver mission-critical capabilities. We remain deeply admitted to our founding mission of supporting the U.S. government honored by the privilege of equipping our nation with transformative software that actually works. We remain focused on delivering the most advanced defense capabilities in the world to the U.S. government and internationally to our allied partners around the world. The momentum we're carrying into Q4 is extraordinary. As we look towards the end of the year, our mission is clear: deliver the production capabilities that turn AI from promise into performance for the enterprises defining the future of their industries through AIP's compounding AI leverage.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks Ryan. 20 years of grinding has built a unique moat and a growing lead. Our products were built for this moment, and the numbers continue to show it. Realizing value from AI in the enterprise requires the elegant integration of LLM workflow and software. And this is only possible with ontology. Our foundational investments in oncology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and in the world ahead. The most significant product developments are the accelerating progress in our AI applications inside of AIP our AIP native development agent that understands how to connect to data sources, how to integrate and transform data, how to create ontologies and functions and build applications it's unleashing incredible speed and productivity for our FTEs and customer developers alike. At 1 customer, 2 human FTEs spond an army of AI FDs to migrate a customer off their legacy data warehouse in 5 days, something that would have taken an army of SIs up to 2 years. This is not a prototype. This is production across our customers, the results are shocking.\nAI Hivemind is a new AIP capability that orchestrates a form of a dynamically generated agents to tackle hard problem solving, idea generation refinement and executable proposal generation that is integrated with ontology and therefore, aware of the context of your enterprise. AI Hivemind was originally developed to solve extremely complex problems in the classified space. But it's already been used to help our commercial customers identify bottlenecks in their supply chain, proactively developing possible solutions and then leveraging AI FD to code that up into an actual solution. In the government space, AI Hivemind is able to take its proposals and generate intricate mission plans right in GAIA and MAVERICK. Our focus with AIP continues to be enterprise autonomy, our normative view of where the value is for AI in the enterprise. Hivemind now lets the AI develop novel solutions to emergent challenges and to identify hidden opportunities. And the rest of AIP enables you to turn those ideas into an implemented reality. Closed-loop evolution of the business with AI possible because of AIP in oncology. We continue to make investments that allow enterprises to extend AIP to the far edge. Edge Ontology is a new lightweight implementation of ontology that runs on mobile devices. It enables customers to build mobile applications or embedded software for hardware, things like drones and robots and is fully integrated with your enterprises AIP instance.\nTurning to field-facing updates. The U.S. Army issued an official public memo directing all Army organizations to consolidate and centralize on Vantage, the Army data platform built on foundry and AI. The Army views this, not merely as a technical decision, but a cultural decision, enabling the data-driven decision-making that continues to make our army the most lethal in the world. This directive will enable the Army to rapidly sunset legacy systems and enable more investment in the Army's Future Force concept and systems. Warp Speed and the American Tech Fellowship, our early investments to support manufacturing and reindustrialization in America are bearing fruit. While works bed launched by helping new defense entrants meet their surging production goals, it's now being rapidly adopted across the traditional defense industrial base and the maritime industrial base. The second cohort of the American Tech Fellowship will be wrapping up in the next few weeks. We started the American tech fellowship because we noticed that many of our best builders were frontline workers. They don't come from conventional consulting background. You don't have formal computer science backgrounds. To highlight a few of these folks, Mason, a Louisiana-based civil engineers building AI applications for more accurate estimates for heavy construction projects, something that is only going to grow with our reindustrialization. Michael, who works for a potato farm in North Dakota is streamlining its operations and Cody from Georgia, who is a utilities expert is building in foundry to deliver safe, reliable energy across the South. These Americans are the true face of innovation, underscoring that it will be the American worker with AI that drives reindustrialization and American prosperity. Our customers have taken notice and asked us to create American tech fellowship programs for their employees, specifically to include Lear who highlighted their fellowship in their recent earnings call.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean. We had an outstanding third quarter achieving a Rule of 40 score of 114, our highest ever by 20 points. We also generated our highest ever reported revenue growth rate of 63% year-over-year exceeding the high end of our prior guidance, a 1,300 basis points and representing a 3,300 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q3 of last year.\nOn the back of this extraordinary strength, we are guiding to revenue of $1.329 billion in the fourth quarter, representing 13% growth quarter-over-quarter, our highest-ever sequential revenue growth guide and 61% growth year-over-year. We're also raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $4.398 billion, representing a 53% year-over-year growth rate and 8-point or $252 million increase over our full year 2025 revenue guidance last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.433 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 104% year-over-year, a 19-point increase over the guidance we gave just last quarter. Accelerating demand for AIP continues to drive the outperformance in our U.S. business overall, which grew 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially in the third quarter. Our U.S. commercial business grew 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially and our U.S. government business grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. We delivered these exceptional top line results while also achieving our highest ever reported adjusted operating margin of 51%, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 500 basis points and highlighting the unit economics of our business at scale. Our revenue and profitability drove a 20-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 94 in the second quarter to 114 in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the first time in the company's history.\nTurning to our global top line results. Third quarter revenue grew 63% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $1.181 billion. Third quarter U.S. revenue grew 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $883 million. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter revenue grew 65% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and third quarter U.S. revenue grew 78% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. We closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.8 billion, up 151% year-over-year. This eclipses our prior highest quarter of TCV bookings just last quarter by nearly $0.5 billion. Customer count grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to 911 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Third quarter trailing 12 months revenue from our top 20 customers increased 38% year-over-year to $83 million per customer.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. Third quarter commercial revenue grew 73% year-over-year and 22% sequentially to $548 million. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that revenue from our commercial business has been larger than our U.S. government business. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter commercial revenue grew 77% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We closed $1.4 billion in commercial TCV bookings representing 132% growth year-over-year and 32% sequentially. AIP continues to drive existing customer expansions and new customer conversions in the U.S. Third quarter U.S. commercial revenue 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to $397 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 126% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. In the third quarter, we closed $1.3 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings representing growth of 342% year-over-year and surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Over the past 12 months, we closed $3.8 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings a 217% increase from the prior 12 months, highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 199% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 530 customers, relucting growth of 65% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.\nThird quarter international commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $152 million. For international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond but remain focused on accelerating the growth in our U.S. business. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $2.9 million for the quarter. We anticipate fourth quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to be between $2 million to $4 million compared to $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be less than half of 1% of full year revenue.\nShifting to our Government segment. Third quarter government revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $633 million. Third quarter U.S. government revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $486 million. This growth was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software offerings. Third quarter international government revenue grew 66% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $147 million, bolstered primarily by our continued work in the U.K. As previously mentioned, we closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.8 billion, up 151% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 134%, an increase of 600 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions of existing customers and new customers acquired in Q3 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar tension does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the third quarter with $8.6 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 91% year-over-year and 21% sequentially and $2.6 billion in the remaining performance obligations, an increase of 66% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. as a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial success. As it is not taken into otoacontracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 84% for the quarter. adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $601 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 51%. Q3 adjusted expense was $581 million, up [ 8% ] sequentially and 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical hiring. We continue to expect expenses to increase in the fourth quarter as we remain committed to investing in the product pipeline and the most elite technical talent, all while delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $393 million, representing a 33% margin. Third quarter GAAP net income was $476 million, representing a 40% margin. Third quarter stock-based compensation expense was $172 million and equity-related employer pay tax expense was $35 million. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.18. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 114% in the third quarter a 20-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter and our ninth consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score. With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 102% for the full year.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the third quarter, we generated $508 million in cash from operations and $540 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 43% and 46%, respectively. Additionally, we achieved $2 billion in trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow for the first time. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $880 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q4 2025, we expect revenue of between $1.327 billion and $1.331 billion and adjusted income from operations of between $695 million and $699 million. For full year 2020, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $4.396 billion and $4.400 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.433 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 104%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $2.151 billion and $2.155 billion, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nGreetings. By any normal or even reasonable standard, these are not normal results. These are not even strong results. These aren't extraordinary results. These are arguably the best results that any software company has ever delivered. And it's dasaybolic. Despite what your analyst friends may want you to believe because they've been wrong at every price, they're wrong in every -- at every single round. But of course, they're perspective and they're not investing our own money. But a normal enterprise company should not have a Rule of 40 above 100. A normal enterprise company at our base should not have over 100% U.S. commercial growth should not have 77% growth in the U.S.\nAnd by the way, that growth is being held down by a stagnant Europe, which is still a significant part of our business. So the pure unvarnished numbers are 77% growth off of a massive significant base, very significant cash flow with a company that throws off a Rule of 40 of 114. And then if this world was at all seen, every single person in the financial world would stop and say, how did this happen? How did a company, which stood by the American Warfighter marine special operators, people in client stand services, who stood up for a rate of free speech and was really the first company to be completely anti with how did the company stick up for the American Warfighter actually give normal Americans venture quality results.\nSo one of the issues we have with the arbiters of truth is, it was the American worker that we supported and the American worker that we helped make rich. And the arbiters are true some did not participate in that because they were such experts. And of course -- but -- what these numbers show is doing that and taking the American worker along with it and doing it in a way that foreshadow the future, FDA ontology foundry, making each specific institution, making the American Warfighter fight the way the American Warfighter is born to fight.\nEmpowering the tenants of being free and having the ability to do creative things in the battlefield context and then an enterprises instead of selling them commodity parasitic software with a massive sales force with a kind of lumbering jargon bearing leaders, offering you stakes and dinners and other things we shall not mention in order that you turn the value -- the high-value revenue of your enterprise over to them in return for these accolades, we created direct alignment with our customers. And what does that mean? It means when our customers have a unique and triable way of doing something, whether it's underwriting or fighting or making workers even more valuable.\nWe put in FDA, we orchestrated an ontology. We take tribal understanding of their business, the specific nature of their business that makes them particular valuable and lethal and we empower that. And how do we participate in that, unlike seemingly in the most obvious way, we are downstream from the value creation. So when you see [ 141 ] or you see 77% or [ 63 ] and you ask -- and by the way, with really a workforce that is not a any way, linearly proportional to that growth and also with a sales force which is declining, which seems improbable. The reason why that's working is because we are making our clients more money or we're making them more dominant on the battlefield, and they're paying us a subset of that. And -- and this is why these numbers are so extraordinary. The sociological political version of this should be, wait a minute, how can we learn from this? How can we implement institutions? By the way, we have all these people talking about AI bottle. I'll tell you what 114 proves. There is a massive part of the AI market that actually cares about value creation, and that's the part we own. And we own that part because to do this, you have to have FD orchestration, you have to have ontology and you have to have foundry and you have to have access to the game, and you have to have a deep understanding of how to do that, and you have to have done this for a very, very long time with products, by the way, and then the products are getting better and better and better and better.\nAnd I'll let Shyam talk about what we're doing on the battlefield to the extent that he can. But you see the very similar trajectory where we're giving America, both in industry and in government, a massive, unfair advantage. And again, you see it like if you look at our numbers, look at how poorly Europe is doing. Look how well America is doing. Look how we're doing this. And again, it's not just top line. The Rule of 114 that we have shows top line and bottom line growth that is distinctive, massive and unique. And on top of everything else, there is this issue in the U.S. that we're all focused on [indiscernible]. What access -- what portion of the GDP growth that we're blessed to have in this country, meaning GDP growth defined or helped out and bolstered by AI. What percentage of that is available to the American worker. And so when we're -- we're AI GDP availability for the American worker meaning, do they participate in this or is it just a people around this table who are getting richer and richer. And then you see our platform on the battlefield as Shyam was mentioning, the people doing the coding in AIP are vocationally trained smart Americans with specific knowledge. They don't have -- and actually, and people on the factory floor, very same thing. People across the nation, truck drivers. Anybody with specific domain expertise is more powerful, more valuable in our product than they were yesterday. In fact, the real misalignment of AI is with people with commodity like high trained elite institution, general specialists that's just not as valuable as it was. And yes, the destructive -- positive destruction of capitalism is going to put that class of people.\nTypically, the class of people that also is skeptical of Palantir under enormous pressure. But it is our -- what I see in these numbers and what I think we see in these numbers is to be -- put it slightly over the top. Yes, we were right, you were wrong, and we are going to go very, very deep on our rightness because it is exceedingly good for America. It's exceedingly good for the American economy. It's as good for American workers and know what I really enjoy turning on TV and seeing some analysts explain why some other company is better than ours simply because they didn't make any in our company and probably aren't. And we're just going to keep going and going and going. And then we're obviously not going to forecast for next year. But I would say, if you're thinking about how this company is going to go, look at our ability to look at our ability to create revenue on the top and look at it -- look at the unit economics of our business. If you're a technical expert in how do you evaluate business, evaluate those numbers against any other business you've ever seen and then make your decision. But yes, I'm wildly enthusiastic. I think we're wildly enthusiastic. And thank you for those of you who stayed with us to enjoy these numbers, especially Palantirians who work day and night to deliver these kind of numbers.",

I'm Ana SOro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2025 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantier.com.\nOver the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer.\nI'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nOur tremendous second quarter results demonstrate how Palantir is redefining what is possible with enterprise AI. We remain maniacally focused on value creation for our customers. Our U.S. business is the engine of this transformation. U.S. commercial led with 93% year-over-year revenue growth, outpacing our U.S. government revenue growth of 53% year-over-year. Our overall U.S. business revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 17% sequentially and now represents 73% of total company revenue.\nWe surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time as our overall revenue growth continued to rapidly accelerate to 48% year-over-year growth in Q2. Through this record-breaking quarter, our Rule of 40 score continued to climb, reaching 94% in Q2, which is up 11 points quarter-over-quarter, particularly noteworthy given the scale of our business.\nAs AI continues to relentlessly advance, the market has become increasingly aware of the most important and fundamental technical reality: LLMs, on their own, are at best a jagged intelligence divorced from even basic understanding. In one moment, they may appear to outperform humans in some problem-solving task. but in the next, they make catastrophic errors no human would ever make. By contrast, our ontology is pure understanding, concretized in software. This is reality, not rhetoric, and enterprises are experiencing this reality keenly. LLMs simply don't work in the real world without Palantir. This is the reality fueling our growth.\nWe booked our highest TCV and ACV ever last quarter with $2.3 billion in TCV and $684 million in ACV. We closed a whopping 157 deals worth $1 million or more, of which 66 deals were worth $5 million or more and 42 deals were worth $10 million or more. We continue to see expansions with our existing customers as our top 20 customers now average $75 million a year in trailing 12-month revenue, up 30% from a year ago.\nThe impact our software is delivering for our customers as they cross the chasm is ever widening their advantage over the AI have-nots. Citibank shared that the customer onboarding process and relevant KYC and security checks that once took them 9 days now takes seconds. Fannie May recently announced they're working with Palantir, decreasing the time to uncover mortgage fraud from 2 months down to seconds, saving the U.S. housing market millions in future fraud losses. Nebraska Medicine President and COO noted they saw a 2,100% increase in discharge lounge utilization, which is the equivalent of adding another unit to their hospital. They even noted, \"We've been using the term a Palantir unit of time, and that represents when we're driving value in less than an hour.\"\nLear Corporation recently signed a 5-year extension. Over the past 2.5 years, they have leveraged foundry and AIP to support over 11,000 users and more than 175 use cases, including proactively managing their tariff exposure, automating multiple administrative workflows and dynamically balancing their manufacturing lines. Their CEO highlighted that their enterprise-wide adoption gives them, \"A first-mover advantage in the automotive industry, which will be difficult to replicate.\"\nOur U.S. commercial business exited Q2 with a 93% year-over-year and 20% sequential growth. Due to its acceleration, U.S. commercial comprised 31% of our Q2 revenue versus 23% a year ago. We continue to focus on delivering AI production impact, evidenced by the strength of new starts and expansions at existing customers. We're seeing new starts with higher ambition and existing customers expand their work at a faster rate.\nA health care company completed a boot camp in April, then signed an $88 million TCV deal a month later to coordinate and automate patient care across facilities. An American telecom company started working with us in 2022 and has increased their contract 10x since then and is now projecting hundreds of millions in cost savings.\nOur U.S. government business grew 53% year-over-year and 14% sequentially last quarter, driven by the impact we're delivering across civil, intel and defense, including greenfield efforts. U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command awarded us a $218 million delivery order to support seamless synchronized multi-domain war fighting for the space and air operational communities. The ceiling for our Maven Smart System contract was increased by $795 million to prepare for what they expect will be significant demand from combatant commands for our AI-powered software capabilities over the next 4 years. Last week, Palantir was awarded a 10-year enterprise agreement with the Army, totaling up to $10 billion, consolidating 75 contracts into a single contract. The Army is one of our longest-standing customers. We are honored to embark on this next phase together. We remain focused with deep respect and dedication on equipping our war fighters with decisive advantages over our adversaries.\nLooking towards the back half of the year, my enthusiasm for our business is at an all-time high. With determination and persistence, we'll continue delivering exceptional AI production impact for our customers, running full speed at the critical challenges they entrust us to solve.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. 20 years of grinding has built a unique moat and a massive lead. Our products were built for this moment, and the numbers show it. Realizing value from AI in the enterprise requires the Elian integration of LLMs, workflow and software, and that's only possible with ontology. As LLMs continue to improve, it only further accelerates the value realization and therefore, the value of our products. Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on the AI demand, both now and in the world ahead.\nA substantial development over the last couple of quarters is the realization and acceleration of our vision of Ontology web services as an architectural concept for our customers. AIP isn't just software our customers use, it's software, our customers are building their software on. Software companies are re-platforming away from the highly unopinionated services and building blocks of the hyperscaler stack onto AIP with its highly opinionated building blocks that get you to value 10x faster.\nChris Johnson, the Co-CEO of TeleTracking, who recently re-platformed on AIP said that he was flooded with inquiries from CEOs and CIOs when he went public on his partnership with Palantir. Re-platforming on AIP has enabled customers to leapfrog their competition and beat them to market. And this will continue to be both a significant area of investment on our product road map and an accelerating growth opportunity for the business across commercial and government.\nI mentioned this last quarter, on their earnings calls, CEOs have been highlighting the transformative impact of AIP on their organizations. That trend continues. But also, this quarter, you can hear from the frontline workers about the same transformation AIP is bringing them. AI is giving the American workers superpowers. At the all-in Winning the AIA Race summit in D.C., an ICU nurse, a factory worker, a hospital administrator, an electric vehicle battery maintenance technician shared how AI is making them better, faster and more productive, giving them more time with patients, more time solving problems and enabling more workers to access the job market.\nOur investments in AI FDE are accelerating the already eye-watering time to value for our customers and providing customers with capabilities to solve bigger and more complex problems independently. AI FDE is designed to enable autonomous execution across a wide array of tasks, including creating and editing ontology, building data transforms, creating functions, debugging issues and building applications. With its own closed-loop error handling, AI FDE can identify and correct issues and notify human users if needed, and it's been designed for seamless collaboration with humans in the loop through integration with AIPs branching.\nWarp Speed, our modern manufacturing operating system built on AIP continues to deliver for our industrial customers, from nuclear companies to the defense industrial base. With MRP speed, a component of work speed, one of our customers remarked that balancing the production line has shifted from 1 day to 1 hour.\nWe have seen a dramatic set of opportunities open up in U.S. shipbuilding as America gets serious about fixing its maritime industrial base. China built more ships last year than we have built cumulatively since the end of World War II. Now the Mighty American engine of innovation is spinning up and tackling this problem head-on.\nMaven Smart System met its moment in recent operations of great import. Maven adoption continues to grow, with usage doubling again since February. Last quarter, I mentioned that usage doubled in the first 9 months of 2024 and doubled again in the subsequent 5 months. This is on top of that.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. We had an unprecedented second quarter, surpassing $1 million of revenue in the quarter for the first time and delivering our highest Rule of 40 score ever of 94.\nQ2 revenue growth accelerated to 48% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by nearly 1,000 basis points and representing a 2,100 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q2 of last year. On the back of this continued strength in the third quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.085 billion, representing over 8% growth quarter-over-quarter, our highest-ever sequential revenue growth guide and 50% growth year-over-year. We are also raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $4.146 billion, representing a 45% year-over-year growth rate, a 9-point increase over our full year 2025 revenue guidance last quarter, and our largest ever full year revenue guidance raise. We are also raising our full year U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.302 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 85% and is higher than the guidance we gave just last quarter.\nAccelerating demand for AIP continues to drive the outperformance in our U.S. business overall, which grew 68% year-over-year and 17% sequentially in the second quarter. Our U.S. commercial business grew 93% year-over-year and 20% sequentially and our U.S. government business grew 53% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. We delivered these outstanding top line results as adjusted operating margin expanded to 46%, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by nearly 300 basis points.\nOur revenue and profitability drove an 11-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 83 in the first quarter to 94 in the second quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $569 million, representing margin of 57%.\nTurning to our global top line results. Second quarter revenue grew 48% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $1.004 billion. Second quarter U.S. revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $733 million. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter revenue grew 49% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, and second quarter U.S. revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. Customer count grew 43% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to 849 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Second quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 30% year-over-year to $75 million per customer.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. Second quarter commercial revenue grew 47% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $451 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter commercial revenue grew 49% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. We closed $1.1 billion in commercial TCV bookings, representing 185% growth year-over-year. AIP continues to drive existing customer expansions and new customer conversions in the U.S. Second quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 93% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $306 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 95% year-over-year and 20% sequentially.\nWe had our strongest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked at $843 million, representing growth of 222% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, we closed $2.8 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings, a 141% increase from the prior 12 months, highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 145% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 485 customers, reflecting growth of 64% year-over-year and 12% sequentially.\nSecond quarter international commercial revenue declined 3% year-over-year and grew 2% sequentially to $144 million. For our international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond, but remain focused on accelerating the growth in our U.S. business.\nRevenue from strategic commercial contracts was $5.1 million for the quarter. We anticipate third quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to be between $2 million to $4 million compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be less than half of 1% of full year revenue.\nShifting to our government segment. Second quarter government revenue grew 49% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $553 million. Second quarter U.S. government revenue grew 53% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $426 million. This growth was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software offerings. Second quarter international government revenue grew 37% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $127 million, bolstered primarily by our continued work in the U.K.\nWe closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.3 billion, up 140% year-over-year. This eclipses our prior highest quarter of TCV bookings in Q4 2024 by nearly $0.5 billion.\nNet dollar retention was 128%, an increase of 400 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q2 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were required in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration of velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the second quarter was $7.1 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 65% year-over-year and 20% sequentially and $2.4 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 77% year-over-year and 27% sequentially.\nAs a reminder, RPU is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 82% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, was $464 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 46%. Q2 adjusted expense was $539 million, up 9% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical hiring. While we expect adjusted operating margin to continue to expand for the second half of the year, as in prior years, we expect a significant ramp in expenses in the third quarter due to the seasonality of new hire starts. We remain committed to investing in the most elite technical talent as well as a product pipeline and AI production use cases, all while delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability.\nSecond quarter GAAP operating income was $269 million, representing a 27% margin. Second quarter GAAP net income was $327 million, representing a 33% margin. Second quarter stock-based compensation expense was $160 million and equity related employer payroll tax expense was $35 million. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.13. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.16. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 94% in the second quarter, an 11-point increase to a Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter, and our eighth consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score. With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 91% for the full year.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $539 million in cash from operations and $569 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 54% and 57%, respectively. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we had $899 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q3 2025, we expect revenue of between $1.083 billion and $1.087 billion and adjusted income from operations of between $493 million and $497 million. For full year 2025, we are raising our revenue 5:21 AM guidance to between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.302 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 85%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $1.912 billion and 1.920 billion. We're raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWell, as usual, I've been cautioned to be a little modest about our bombastic numbers, but honestly, there's no authentic way to be anything, but have enormous pride and gratefulness about these extraordinary numbers.\nNow when you look -- obviously, looking at numbers, there's numbers and what do they mean? So if you take, I would say, the truly once in a generation number of 93% growth in U.S. com off of a large base or even 53% growth in USG, which is astonishing even though, obviously, it shows where the government is downstream from general trends in AI or the 68% growth in the U.S., you still have to say, why are these numbers even more astonishing than they appear. Well, obviously, you would look at what is the meaning of the number. And the Rule of 40 basically tells you the meaning of the number. And if that number is somewhere in the 50, 60, 70, that's pretty baller. When it's the single most impressive number, I think any enterprise software company has ever seen, there is something anomalous going on. And obviously, the prediction that all the attendees would be downstream from the value, so it would be chips and ontology, is being proven not as a thesis, but as a reality.\nAnd then you would obviously ask what is the base. We're now working off of a very large base getting to -- we did our $1 billion. So it's a very significant run rate. But then I would say, if you look at a kind of more qualitative version of Palantir, we did this with no compromise in terms of what we believe. We still believe America is the leader of the free world, that the West is superior, that we have to fight for these values, that we should give American corporations and, most importantly, our government an unfair advantage. We've demonstrated in every area and arena of American life and international life that we do deliver an unfair advantage for our allies, our friends and our compatriots. We have done this by creating a company where every single component is value accretive.\nThere are almost no parasitic elements to this company. We have a small sales force. We have very little BS internally. We have a flat hierarchy. We have the most qualified interesting people heterodox on their beliefs. We have an orchestration engine that deploys for deployed engineers everywhere a model that everyone despised and destined until literally a quarter ago and thought would lead to a low multiple. I guess you're wrong. We have a series of products that are on the front line, most notably oncology, but also foundry and Maven. And this is a confluence. This is the perfect time for Palantir.\nAnd I would also say at the risk of saying the obvious, this is a perfect time for a revolution in the United States of America. We are very, very bullish on America. We have some really crucial and important clients internationally, large clients, commercial clients in Europe and also government clients outside of America that we're proud of. But this is an American revolution. It's being led by ontology and chips and to also, to some extent, large language model providers. We are also anomalously bullish on all aspects of American Life, including and especially people in the blue collar. We're going to -- Shyam and others are leading our charge to arm the working class or blue-collar workers with AI agency enhancing skills. AI is an agency enhancing revolution. Our numbers show that. We've seen on the front line in the United States government that people with less than a college education are creating a lot value and sometimes more value than people with a college education. using our product. We're also going to reach out to labor leaders and help them organize ways that workers can earn AI-enhanced earnings.\nBut in general, what you see in our numbers, and the reason it's so successful, is our clients and partners are downstream from our unit economics, and they want our unit economics. And we are teaching them ways in which to work, both cultural and with our products that will allow them to get unit economics that look like 94, 93, 68, 53, respectively. Those numbers are astonishing, incredible, and we're planning to share them with our partners via exposing them to a way in which to work in an AI revolution so that they have the same kind of agency we do. I run around U.S. commercial telling corporate leaders, \"If you want to have your first amendment rights to an opinion again, get our unit economics and then you too can say things that are true in public like we do.\" It's very motivating to people and very motivating to us.\nSo thank you for all of our supporters, and we should entertain questions, but this is a once in a generation truly anomalous quarter, and we're very proud, and we're sorry that our haters are disappointed, but there are many more quarters to be disappointed, and we're working on that, too.",

I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations.\nThese statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today.\nOur press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nOur first quarter of the year showcased incredible strength and remarkable momentum as revenue grew 39% year-over-year. Our story continues to be one of preeminence in the U.S. Our U.S. revenue grew 55% year-over-year and now makes up 71% of our overall business. Our U.S. commercial businesses extraordinary momentum continued as revenue grew 71% year-over-year. Our foundational U.S. government business achieved compelling revenue growth of 45% year-over-year. Our results continue to redefine the Rule of 40 with our Rule of 40 score increasing from 81 in Q4 to 83 last quarter. While organizations may consider curtailing spending to drive efficiencies or weather heightened volatility, they find this is the moment they need Palantir the most. The time they turn to us asking how can we help them adapt and solve their latest challenges.\nAs AI models progress and improve, we continue enabling our customers to maximally leverage these models in production, capitalizing upon the rich context within the enterprise through the Ontology. We remain differentiated in our elite execution to deliver quantified exceptionalism for our customers, ever widening their advantage over the AI have-nots. As a result, unrelenting demand for AIP continues to drive outperformance despite Q1 historically being our slowest quarter due to business seasonality. Our U.S. commercial revenue grew 19% sequentially to surpass the $1 billion annual run rate for revenue in Q1. We closed $810 million in U.S. commercial TCV with a 239% year-over-year growth rate on a dollar-weighted duration basis, and we closed twice as many deals of $1 million or more compared to the same time period a year ago. I feel the demand in the conversations I'm having with customers. On the ground, things are accelerating. Customers are getting started then expanding in quick succession. A large health care company did a boot camp with us in December and 5 weeks later converted to a 5-year $26 million ACV enterprise agreement.\nA global bank started a pilot with us in Q4 2024, signed a $2 million engagement a month later then expanded to a 3-year $19 million ACV engagement 4 months after that. A Fortune 500 health care company began working with us in Q2 2024 and last quarter, signed a 5-year $10 million ACV conversion deal. The pace and magnitude of these deals are being driven by the quantified exceptionalism our customers received from day 1 working with us. We continue to hear from customers that our software's impact is remarkably apparent. A Walgreens executive recently highlighted Foundry and AIP allowed them to play AI-powered end-to-end workflows in 4,000 stores within 8 months, automating what would have amounted to 384 billion decisions every day if relying on humans. AIG recently highlighted that they expect the end-to-end adoption of tech advancements leveraging Palantir will double their 5-year CAGR. They noted, \"It's an unbelievable outcome in terms of what we get. You could give underwriters unlimited time, 2, 3, 4 weeks. They still can't get the amount of data that I can get within 2 to 3 hours through Palantir.\" We are partnering with R1 RCM to develop intelligent automation solutions to create faster, more precise health care reimbursement outcomes.\nTheir executive noted, \"we believe there's a multi-$100 billion opportunity here industry-wide to put money back into the pockets of providers and physicians so they can better invest in patient outcomes.\" Our name is popping up across earnings calls around the world as companies like Citibank, BP and L3Harris tout the ambition of their work with Palantir to their investors. Our U.S. government business continues to achieve impressive growth as we deliver towards the vital missions of the agencies we support. As the government focuses on efficiency, our commercially fielded, battle hardened products stand-alone.\nLast quarter, we closed deals expanding our work in the Department of Defense, including the critical impact we are delivering with Maven Smart System across the CoCom and the services. The impact is far reaching. Internationally, we closed a deal to provide Palantir Maven Smart System to NATO to deploy our AI Mission Command solution across its 32 member states. Historically, in periods of turmoil organizations, both public and private, have turned to Palantir. With the proliferation of AI, you see an even wider gap between the winners and losers. The winners won't be determined by size, but by adaptability. Many organizations are having to reimagine how their business does and should work in the future simply to survive. We are built to help companies embrace volatility. We expect more surprises, not less. And with the uncertainty ahead, we are more confident than ever in Palantir's ability to deliver tangible impact for our customers to transform organizations with real workflows in production and to help institutions adapt to survive.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. We've been consistently saying that even while the LOMs are improving, the models across both closed and open source, they're becoming more similar and that performance will converge, all while cost per token for inference continues to drop substantially. The market has been focused on AI supply, the models, while we have been focused on delivering on AI demand. It's now blindingly obvious to everyone after the first DeepSeek moment. Our foundational investments in Ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and into the world ahead. AIP has entered the next phase of product development and adoption focused on enterprise autonomy. As I mentioned last call, the normative value of AI is the self-driving company. We're not talking about copilots that make you 50% more productive, we're talking about agents that make you 50x more productive.\nAIP is increasingly owning the position of being the technology that translate the ever-expanding raw capability of LLM into business outcomes through oncology. AIP is proving to be the best harness to build, test, evaluate and deploy agents to eat the elephant of the enterprise. Everyday users are building their own agents to realize the potential of enterprise autonomy across both public and private sector. AI agents are operating as part of human AI teams, leveraging the mix of workflow applications for mammals and code-first approaches for AI agents with Ontology as that common intermediary representation of the state of the enterprise. Agents are having a transformative impact for our customers now from targeting our enemies to targeting supply chain opportunities.\nYou can hear more about these stories, not in our earnings call, but as Ryan mentioned, in our customers' earnings calls, AIG, City, BP, L3Harris, Hertz all mentioned the transformative impact of AIP on their most recent calls. These agents represent AI users, the supply chain agent that works with your supply chain analysts, the intelligence AI agent that works with your human agents. AI as a platform enables our customers to rapidly build and deploy AI agents that automate more and more of the enterprise in a continuous fashion.\nAIG announced the AI underwriting agent. AI agents are processing vast volumes of intelligence reports in the Department of Defense, finding things humans missed. AI agents are monitoring for sepsis at Tampa General. As Ryan mentioned, our U.S. business is on fire. And I want to, again, call out the continued strength, with Warp Speed in particular, our modern American manufacturing operating system. Both the adoption and the rate of product development has exceeded expectations. These investments are powering America's reindustrialization, not only with new defense entrants, but also with traditional defense industrial players and the broader manufacturing industry.\nTurning to government. We delivered our first Titan vehicles to the U.S. Army in Q1, on time, on budget. The army rate of Titan as a top-performing program. And everything about it is heretical, a military vehicle with a software company as the prime contractor, and it's built by a team of nontraditional defense innovators like [indiscernible]. Maven Smart System adoption continues to grow, with usage doubling in the first 9 months of 2024 and doubling again in the 5 subsequent months. The rate of adoption has really accelerated as Maven scales across more combatant commands and through the services and into more and more use cases. You commonly hear combatant commanders reference Maven in their posture hearings to Congress now. And Maven has reached Europe, with NATO adopting the capabilities of Maven Smart System as its C2 operating system. Leadership at uComm said, \"this platform, Maven, has become more than a common operating picture, it's a decision advantage environment that is rapidly transforming the command.\" AI agents aren't just transforming the U.S. commercial sector, they are transforming how we fight. AI agents are analyzing intelligence, finding targets, automating staff functions and improving the understanding of the battle space. But we are just at the beginning. Our defense users are amongst the most creative and self-sufficient developers. Green suiters developed the Hurricane Helene Rescue common operating picture in 5 days. Next time, they will have AI agents do it for them in 5 minutes.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. We had an exceptional first quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 39% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by nearly 350 basis points and representing an 1,800 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q1 of last year. We achieved another $1 billion milestone this quarter by surpassing $1 billion annual run rate in our U.S. commercial business for the first time, which grew 71% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. On the back of this continued strength, we are raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $3.896 billion, representing a 36% year-over-year growth rate and our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.178 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 68%. The continued increase in demand for AIP drove the outperformance in your U.S. business overall in the first quarter, which grew 55% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, including our U.S. government business, which grew 45% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.\nWe delivered these outstanding top line results at an adjusted operating margin of 44%, representing an 800 basis point increase compared to the first quarter of last year. Our revenue and profitability drove a 2-point sequential increase to a Rule of 40 score from 81 in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 83 in the first quarter of 2025. We also had a strong cash flow quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $370 million, representing a margin of 42%.\nTurning to our global top line results. First quarter revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $884 million. First quarter U.S. revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to $628 million. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter revenue grew 44% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, and first quarter U.S. revenue grew 56% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Customer count grew 39% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 769 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. First quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 26% year-over-year to $70 million per customer.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. First quarter commercial revenue grew 33% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $397 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter commercial revenue grew 42% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. We closed $930 million in commercial TCV bookings, representing 84% growth year-over-year. As I highlighted earlier, we achieved a $1 billion annual run rate in our U.S. commercial business for the first time as AIP continues to drive both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S. First quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year-over-year and 19% sequentially to $255 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 75% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We are the strongest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked at $810 million, representing growth of 183% year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, we closed over $2 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 127% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 432 customers reflecting growth of 65% year-over-year and 13% sequentially.\nFirst quarter international commercial revenue declined 5% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $141 million. The decline was driven by continued headwinds in Europe and by the onetime revenue catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2024 that we noted on last quarter's call. For our international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond, but remain focused on accelerating the growth in our U.S. business.\nRevenue from strategic commercial contracts was $5.1 million for the quarter. We anticipate second quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to be between $4 million to $6 million compared to $9 million in the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to continue to be approximately 0.5 of 1% of full year revenue.\nShifting to our Government segment. First quarter government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $487 million. First quarter U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $373 million. This growth was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software offerings. First quarter international government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $114 million, bolstered by our continued work in U.K. health care and defense as well as our new partnership with NATO.\nFirst quarter TCV booked was $1.5 billion, up 66% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 124%, an increase of 400 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q1 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from the new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it has not yet fully captured the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the first quarter with $5.97 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 45% year-over-year and 10% sequentially and $1.9 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 46% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 82% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, and related employer payroll taxes was $391 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 44%. Q1 adjusted expense was $493 million, up 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical hiring. We continue to expect to see a more significant increase in expense in 2025 as we invest in the most elite technical talent, the product pipeline and AI production use cases, all delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability.\nFirst quarter GAAP operating income was $176 million, representing a 20% margin. First quarter GAAP net income was $214 million, representing a 24% margin. First quarter stock-based compensation expense was $155 million and employee-related equity tax expense was $59 million. First quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.08. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.13. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 83% in the first quarter, a 2-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter on our 7th consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score. With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 80 for the full year.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the first quarter, we generated $310 million in cash from operations and $370 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 35% and 42%, respectively. Through the end of the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $918 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q2 2025, we expect revenue of between $934 million and $938 million, adjusted income from operations of between $401 million and $405 million. For full year 2025, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $3.89 billion and $3.902 billion, we are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.178 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 68%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $1.711 billion and $1.723 billion. We're raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our earnings adventure. Palantir is on fire. We -- there's been a lot of discussions basically how we should talk about these numbers and people admonishing me to be a little more modest. And we'll try. It's the reality of what's going on is that this is an unvarnished concafeny of of the combination of 20 years of investment and a massive cultural shift in the U.S. which is generating numbers, again, 71% growth in U.S. commercial, 71%. We had journalists this morning that were asking me if it's a 7 handle, a 71% growth, we had 45% growth in our U.S. government business. Every 3 days, you read a headline about how our commercial business would be in danger because of pressure -- necessary pressure put on the system to root out fraud waste and abuse and to pentest systems to see if they create more value or much more value or less value or no value in the U.S. government. We are seeing rapid expansion and very significant demand for Maven, both in America and outside of America as all part of our core mission to provide an unfair advantage to the Noble warriors of the West.\nWe see an increased recognition that large language models were commodities that the value of these commodities becomes only realizable in the context of our Ontology on top of foundry. As has been mentioned, the reindustrialization of America is happening in our software, the ability to reimagine your business in a volatile situation happens in our software. If you take the 90% of our business that is outside of Europe, which is going through a very structural change and doesn't quite get AI. Maybe in the near future, we'll get AI, we are hoping and praying, that part of our business grew 49%, 49%. And we're doing this at a very significant scale. So we're saying we're going to do close to $4 billion in revenue.\nAnd last, not least, we're doing this with double the gold standard on the rule of 40. The Rule of 40 is a very important standard because it shows you the quality of your revenue and because it's hard to attain, especially if you have a rule of 83. And one of the things that Palantir is doing is we want to bring our friends and our allies along with us on this winning ride. Those friends are largely in America, but also among allied countries. Those friends are inside Palantir, outside Palantir. And we are using Ontology and AI, or AIP, to drive these successes. And I would say, while profitability is apparently unpopular, the numbers are driven by the fact that we are downstream from value creation.\nThere's a consensus in the market that Palantir owns value creation. And what does that actually mean? It means that when you use our software, when you use you will get demonstrably more value than what you're paying for, and you will share some of that value with us. And then I would say also, culturally, we just don't see the resistance to the way we roll that we did in the past. We would show up in the past the freak show trying to get things to work not with the wrong access to the wrong people at the wrong time. And that was by intent. And people were very uncomfortable at all levels of the enterprise working with us. And without going into specific names, because these companies, in many cases, are in the middle of transforming itself, but it -- I'm on the front line with everyone here, and it used to be 2 years ago that we might get a CEO, he might get a CIO, we might get someone to Marketing. We might get someone who's willing to rebuild the business, but they had no power.\nNow we have the full stack engaged with us, inside government, outside government on the most critical issues. And if you -- again, if you look at the math in terms of where the action is, our business is growing 49% ex Continental Europe, 49%, Rule of 83. We were the freak show. And we spent 20 years for this moment and we planned to have [indiscernible] to the grindstone, focused on taking the best talent inside Palantir managing them, the best clients and make sure our clients and our partners especially in national security, but also with a pretty significant focus on the U.S. win in the way we're winning and that's why you get these results. And we're going to just focus and focus and focus and focus on execution. And that's basically our plan for the rest of the year and into next year. And we're very, very optimistic about what's going on. And with that, we can kick it off to questions.",

I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.\nOver the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\n2024 was nothing short of incredible for Palantir. Our momentum accelerated through year-end, closing out 2024 with exceptional Q4 results, including an extraordinary top line beat and outperformance led by our U.S. business. Revenue grew 14% sequentially and 36% year-over-year in Q4 and 29% year-over-year for the full year.\nThe AI revolution continues, transforming industries and redefining how organizations operate. AI is a pivotal component in driving innovation and efficiency, something companies need to embrace or fall behind. With the proliferation of AI models, the raw AI labor supply is exploding. While everyone else is focused on the model supply side, we're transforming AI into a measurable stream of high-value finished goods and services. The result? The rapid emergence of quantified exceptionalism for organizations able to unlock the potential of these commoditized models through AIP.\nA byproduct of our incredible progress, our Rule of 40 score increased to 81 in the fourth quarter. It's a substantial leap to deploy LLMs into production with real impact. Most organizations are currently stuck on the wrong side of the widening chasm, working on their 2-, 5- and 10-year plans, which become obsolete days later, failing to ever take action, but not Palantir or our quickly growing customer base. We've taken our position through our decades-long investment in developing the ontology, which allows organizations to seamlessly weave LLM into their enterprise, unlocking their highest potential leverage.\nIn this AI revolution, anyone looking for a solution that actually works is going to choose Palantir. Last quarter alone, we closed $1.8 billion of TCV across our business, which represents a 56% increase year-over-year. We closed a record-setting number of deals in Q4, including 32 deals worth $10 million or more. Our U.S. business is at the forefront of the AI revolution, growing 52% year-over-year in Q4.\nLast quarter, U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. AIP continues to fuel new customer acquisition as we have nearly 5x the number of U.S. commercial customers as we did 3 years ago and significant expansion opportunities at existing customers. Organizations who have crossed the chasm with Palantir are driving real impact quickly. In this AI revolution, the biggest risk is not moving fast enough and organizations are looking to us.\nWith Palantir, as soon as work begins, we're delivering real quantified exceptionalism for our customers. In my conversations, they're excitedly asking how we can replicate the success across their organizations. One of America's largest pharmacies has been a customer since early 2024 and signed a $67 million TCV engagement with us right after the pilot for workflows, including automatically load balancing, prescription fulfillment, and orchestrating patient outreach.\nAn American telecompany became a customer approximately 2 years ago and recently signed a $40 million TCV expansion deal to help manage and accelerate their decommissioning of old network technologies and equipment in order to achieve significant cost savings. Last earnings call, we mentioned a leading global insurance organization that deployed AIP to help automate underwriting workflows, reducing a 2-week process to 3 hours. That organization signed a nearly $11 million ACV expansion deal in Q4.\nPanasonic Energy North America is seeing the effects of its AIP expansion as they've created a maintenance assistant to help 350 technicians in making 5.5 million batteries per day, resulting in reduced machine downtime, greater throughput, and rapid onboarding of new technicians. In Q4, we also announced the customers in the inaugural Warp Speed cohort, which are using Palantir's Warp Speed to gain an advantage in aspects of their manufacturing operating system, including automated visual quality inspections and dynamic production scheduling. Anduril's CIO, Tom Bosco noted, \"By using the software, we've seen up to 200x efficiency gain in our ability to anticipate and respond to supply shortages.\"\nOur U.S. government business, the foundation on which Palantir was built is exceedingly strong with revenue growing 45% year-over-year last quarter. We take pride in supporting the critical missions we're delivering against. Notable deals included the U.S. Army extending its long-standing partnership with Palantir to deliver the Army Vantage capability in support of the Army data platform for up to 4 years. We also announced our recent contract expansion with U.S. Special Operations Command, marking the first deployment of Mission Manager to U.S. Special Operations Forces units.\nOur international commercial business continues to see pockets of growth alongside the large renewals of some of our long-standing customers. For example, Rio Tinto extended their partnership with Palantir for an additional 4 years, noting AIP is making their unstructured data accessible, allowing them to quickly attack problems previously deemed too complex. Software, network rail specialists coordinate 53 driverless trains, each with 240 wagons, ultimately improving throughput and safety.\nOur international government business also achieved strong growth. Revenue increased 26% sequentially last quarter, driven in large part by the U.K., including our work with the NHS to roll out the Federated Data Platform as 87 acute NHS trusts and 28 integrated care boards have signed up to use it as of November 2024. We accelerated through the end of the year and we remain full throttle. We're at the dawn of this AI revolution, and in this winner-take-all AI economy, Palantir leads the way. I'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. For the last 2 years, we've been saying that even while the LLMs are improving, the models across both open and closed source are becoming more similar and performance will converge, all while the cost per token for inference continues to drop substantially. And that's because the market's been focused on AI supply, the models. With the release of DeepSeek-R1, that has gone from a contrarian position to consensus. It's now blindingly obvious to everyone.\nOur foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand. From the beginning, AIP was built for this reality. Chat was always a dead end. Instead, we viewed LLMs as a new run time for the AI labor. To capture the productive value of this AI labor, you need an intermediate representation of your enterprise that AI can actually interact with. How do you allocate inventory, onboard customers, process claims, call for prior authorization and the like? That intermediary representation that makes all of that possible is ontology, and that's why it's been the secret to our meteoric rise.\nWe are convinced the normative value for AI is enterprise autonomy, the self-driving company. Users go from performing the workflow to supervising an army of agents, teaching them how to handle edge cases and reducing dwell time. This is where we are maniacally focused with our customers. We've been working with a large multinational bank to automate core back-office processes. What used to take 5 days now takes 3 minutes. Much more than the labor savings, this improvement eliminates historical constraints on the middle office and now enables the bank to create entirely new and differentiated financial products.\nWe're working with the top engineering and construction firm to automate the identification of risks across tens of thousands of pages of technical documents, replacing months of arduous manual reviews with AI labor that can flag major risks to engineers in minutes. And we're working with a large power systems company to automate the understanding of technical diagrams to turn them to quotes into orders. And finally, we're working with an automotive supplier to analyze CAD files for component designs to have AI labor validate engineering and manufacturability checks. That is a 100-hour process for human engineers, now automated and serving up exceptions for human review.\nThe before and after with AI is stark and the speed of implementation is accelerating. You can divide companies into 2 categories, the quick and the dead. Turning to Warp Speed, Palantir's modern American manufacturing operating system, it continues to move at -- Our nation is in the beginning of a great reindustrialization as we compete with China to secure a free world and individual liberties. This is a competition we cannot afford to lose. We announced our first cohort of Warp Speed customers, including Anduril and L3Harris.\nThe response has been exceptional and the pipeline is swelling. Warp Speed integrates engineering, test, production, quality and operations so that manufacturers can build better and build faster. Our FedStart offering hit a major milestone with the approval of our FedRAMP high environment for FedStar customers. This is radical acceleration, both in reduction of time and cost of market access for software companies in the federal space.\nFinally, in U.S. government, our deep investments in CJADC2 continue to deliver results. Maven continues to see significant adoption in its pathfinding new AI capabilities throughout the kill chain. Substantial new investments integrating contested logistics into Maven's AI-enabled kill chain met their moment in exercises in Q4. Adoption continues within the military department, specifically Army, Air Force and Space Force as well as at the Combatant Commands with expansions at Spacecom, SouthCom, Africom and Stratcom.\nWhile Hurricane Helene response galvanized the adoption of Maven on beyond just the secret and top secret networks. The adoption has continued to grow as Maven is used for securing our nation's border and securing our nation's air space by enabling drone domain awareness. And Maven is reaching our allies and partners via U.S. supplied capabilities called Maven REL, all spurred by real-world events and the need to collaborate in real time and crisis.\nWe are really just getting started with Maven and have an ambitious road map and a set of customer opportunities in front of us to deliver the unfair advantage our war fighters deserve. I'll turn it over to Dave to talk us through the numbers.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. We had an outstanding fourth quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 36% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our prior [indiscernible] by over 900 basis points and representing a 1,600 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q4 of last year. America continues to rapidly embrace the AI revolution, and we saw this unrelenting demand drive impressive performance in our U.S. business, which grew 52% year-over-year and 12% sequentially.\nOur U.S. commercial business grew 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, and our U.S. government business grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. On the back of this continued strength, we are guiding to a full year 2025 revenue midpoint of 3.749 billion, representing a 31% year-over-year growth rate. We delivered these outstanding top line results while expanding adjusted operating margin to 45%, the strongest adjusted operating margin in the company's history.\nOur revenue and profitability drove a 13-point sequential increase to a Rule of 40 score from 68 in the third quarter to 81 in the fourth quarter. We also had an exceptional cash flow quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $517 million, representing a margin of 63% and $1.25 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the full year, representing a margin of 44%.\nTurning to global top line results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 36% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $828 million. Full year revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $2.87 billion. Full year U.S. revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 14% sequentially and full year revenue grew 32% year-over-year. Customer count grew 43% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to 711 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Fourth quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 18% year-over-year to $65 million per customer.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. Fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 31% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $372 million. Full year commercial revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 37% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and full year commercial revenue grew 36% year-over-year. We had the strongest quarter of commercial TCV booked at $995 million, representing 42% growth year-over-year and 63% growth sequentially.\nOur U.S. commercial business is seeing unprecedented demand with AIP driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S. Fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $214 million. Full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $702 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 76% year-over-year and 19% sequentially, and full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 69% year-over-year.\nWe also had our strongest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked at $803 million, representing growth of 134% year-over-year and 170% sequentially. This exceeded our next highest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked by nearly $400 million, highlighting the increased demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 99% year-over-year and 47% sequentially.\nOur U.S. commercial customer count grew to 382 customers, growth of 73% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Fourth quarter international commercial revenue grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $158 million, partially driven by revenue catch-up from a customer in Asia. Full year international commercial revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $594 million. For international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond, but remain focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. commercial business.\nRevenue from strategic commercial contracts was $9.6 million for the quarter. We anticipate first quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to decline to between $4 million to $6 million compared to $24 million in the first quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be approximately half of 1% of full year revenue.\nShifting to our government segment. Fourth quarter government revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $455 million. Full year government revenue grew 28% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Fourth quarter U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $343 million. Full year U.S. government revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. This acceleration was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software offerings.\nFourth quarter international government revenue grew 28% year-over-year and 26% sequentially to $112 million, bolstered by our continued work in U.K. health care and defense. Full year international government revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $372 million. Fourth quarter TCV book was $1.79 billion, up 56% year-over-year and 63% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 120%, an increase of 200 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q4 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution.\nAs net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it has not yet fully captured the acceleration of velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the fourth quarter with $5.43 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 40% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, and $1.73 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 39% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As a reminder, ARPU is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it did not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 83% for the quarter and the full year. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $373 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 45%. Full year adjusted income from operations was $1.13 billion, representing a margin of 39%.\nQ4 adjusted expense was $455 million, up 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, and full year adjusted expense was $1.74 billion, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical talent. We expect to see a more significant increase in expense in 2025 as we invest in technical hires to product pipeline and continue our focus on AI production use cases, all while delivering our goals of sustained GAAP profitability.\nOn the back of the strength of our results, we want to congratulate our employees for the successful delivery of their market vesting stock appreciation rights or SARs. As a result of this achievement, we accelerated $131 million of onetime expense in the fourth quarter related to these equity awards. Fourth quarter stock-based compensation expense was $282 million and employer-related equity tax expense was $80 million. Full year stock-based compensation expense was $692 million, and employer-related equity tax expense was $126 million.\nFourth quarter GAAP operating income was $11 million, representing a margin of 1%. Fourth quarter operating income when excluding onetime SAR-related expenses, was $142 million, representing a 17% margin. Full year GAAP operating income was $310 million, representing an 11% margin. Full year operating income when excluding onetime SAR-related expenses, was $442 million, representing a 15% margin. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $79 million, representing a 10% margin. Fourth quarter net income, when excluding onetime SAR-related expenses, was $165 million, representing a 20% margin.\nFull year GAAP net income was $462 million, representing a 16% margin. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.03, and earnings per share when excluding onetime SAR-related expenses was $0.07. Full year GAAP earnings per share was $0.19. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.14. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $0.41. Additionally, our combined rate growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 81% in the fourth quarter, a 13-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we generated $460 million in cash from operations and $517 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 56% and 63%, respectively. For the full year, we generated $1.15 billion in cash from operations and $1.25 billion in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 40% and 44%, respectively. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $936 million remaining of the original authorization.\nWe ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook. For Q1 2025, we expect: revenue of between $858 million and $862 million; and adjusted income from operations of between $354 million and $358 million. For full year 2025, we expect revenue of between $3.741 billion and $3.757 billion, U.S. commercial revenue in excess of $1.079 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 54%; adjusted income from operations of between $1.551 and $1.567 billion; adjusted free cash flow of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, and GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our Palantir evolution, otherwise known as our earnings call. There really is a lot of debate about with these numbers if we even should have an earnings call, but there was also a lot of debate around which number is the best internally. We were undecided whether our 29% growth in aggregate, our 38% growth in the U.S., our 54% growth in U.S. commercial, our Rule of 81. They may have to redo the rule because when you're doing twice the rule, of course, maybe the rule isn't fair to other companies. We may have to have a different rule, the Rule of 70 or something.\nBut we believe through that, over twice the Rule of 40. To say we did it our way is a minimization of what that meant. We have taken a long bet over decades around the assumption that if we built the products that our partners, most importantly, our partners in the West, most importantly, our partners in the U.S., ought to build, not what they wanted us to build, not what they mandated we should build, not what investors, venture capitalists or analysts were saying they reward us for building, that company would generate so much value that we would get a small percentage of that. And we would end up as a massive significant and much more importantly, impactful company that could power the West to its obvious innate superiority, expose things that weren't working, rebuild the whole infrastructure of a company.\nWe did that with many platforms. Most successfully, however, was our interest in figuring out how to power human-driven analytics with the assumption that what ought to come would not be human driven, i.e., would be AI at some point and that AI potentially could be something like a large language model. And what we've delivered to the market is a symbiotic relationship between data, computer, LLMs, organized, powered, made possible, made valuable by something we dare to call an Ontology, which was in the beginning viewed as a highly obnoxious anticlimactic term that people thought we were using to escape bad financials.\nAnd that Ontology and our willingness to stick to our guns, again, because there's been billions and billions and billions of dollars invested in large language models, the idea that you could dare to build a product that was built on the assumption that the power of large language models would be in their -- the ability to operationalize them in the context of the enterprise in common language.\nSo that was a revolution that we saw, that we built against, that we've led, that we've gotten off the ground for us in America. We have 54% growth in U.S. home. By the way, USG has now reaccelerated. It grew 30%. We are guiding above 30% at 31%. And we're doing this in a very, very complicated environment. The part of the reason we've done so well is experts look to the past as an indication of the future, and we're looking to the future as an indication of the present. And it's very, very hard to figure out what's going to happen.\nYou see, as much as I personally care about the broader west, including Continental Europe, despite our best efforts and working on every day, it's anemic. We're growing around 4% on 13% of our company. It does look like the continent of Europe will look to the past as a way of getting to the future, struggles with the idea that all the technology in this area is built in America. Perhaps our goal is with the fact that to make LLMs work, you have to find a way to build something like an Ontology. There's 1 available at Palantir.\nWe have rejected all the way through anti-meritocratic concepts, anti-transparent concepts. We're at the forefront of civil liberties. One of the reasons Ontology is so valuable is because the concepts that we built into PG, that we built into Foundry, that are expressed in branching, our concepts that both accelerate revenue, it get -- decelerate, control CapEx, i.e., make the margins something like what you would find at Palantir but do it in a way that actually make the enterprise better, healthier, more ethical.\nWe, at the end of the day, at Palantir are exporting our culture and way of doing things to enterprises, especially in America by allowing enterprises to capture their tribal knowledge in a way that they can utilize LLM, i.e., take the commodity side of LLM and hypercharge or specialize their secrets of their enterprise using the secrets of our enterprise, namely, how do you build product? How do you end up with Ontology? How do you implement it?\nAnd last not least, we believe we are making America more lethal, making our adversaries increasingly afraid of acting against the of America and especially Americans. And we are proud of our moral stance, and we are very long on the U.S. and what's happening and what will happen in the future. And with that, we should open up our earnings call. This is obviously a very, very special time to be at Palantir.\nPalantirians are very excited. And I am -- yes, it's by far the best time to be at Palantir. One of the things that's crazy important about our time at Palantir now is it's actually the vibe internally, the vibe with our clients, the vibe with inside of our products is we are at the way beginning of our trajectory. We are at the way beginning of revolution. And we plan to be a cornerstone, if not the cornerstone company and driving this revolution in the U.S. over the next 3 to 5 years. Thank you.",

I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2024 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results.\nInformation concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today.\nOur press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe are thrilled to report tremendous results for our business, driven foremost by strong execution in our U.S. commercial business and continued U.S. government business acceleration. Overall revenue growth, excluding strategic commercial contracts, accelerated to 30% year-over-year and 10% sequential in Q2. Our exceptional results are a reflection of a market that is quickly awakening to a reality that our customers have already known, we stand alone in our ability to deliver enterprise AI production impact at scale.\nWe are delivering these results in the face of an unprecedented enterprise AI opportunity. As noted by Sequoia, the revenue expectations from the AI ecosystem's infrastructure build-out have grown from $200 billion to $600 billion per year in just 9 months. The world is struggling with this huge problem. There's a great bottleneck between prototype and production. The world has also come to understand what we've been saying all along: The standard playbook does not and will not work. It cannot solve this problem.\nWhile many companies can build prototypes, the leap from prototype to production is substantial. Palantir has made that leap. Our focus is on deploying enterprise AI and production, solving meaningful problems for our customers. We have the right products at the right time, and our history means that we understand the $600 billion opportunity unlike anyone else in the space. We are uniquely situated and you see that in our results now.\nLast quarter, we signed 27 deals worth $10 million or more and closed nearly $1 billion of TCV. One of the most notable indicators of our delivery is the volume of existing customers who are signing expansion deals, many of which are a direct result of AIP. We continue to see the greatest transformation in our U.S. commercial business, evident in the mini AIP-driven deals closed last quarter. Our U.S. commercial revenue, excluding strategic commercial contracts, climbed 70% year-over-year. Our U.S. commercial ACV closed was up 44% year-over-year and up 19% sequentially, while our deal count in U.S. commercial was nearly twice what it was just a year ago.\nWe maintain conviction in our ability to land new customers and subsequently expand those engagements as we sharpen our focus to taking our customers across the chasm from prototype to production. Tampa General signed a 7-year expansion, deploying AIP to deliver a care coordination operating system, where we've helped them reduce patient length of stay by 30%. Panasonic Energy of North America signed a 3-year expansion using AIP across finance, quality control, and manufacturing operations.\nAARP shared they're utilizing AIP to provide targeted, personalized experiences for their 29 million unique visitors on a monthly basis. Eaton deepened our relationship, leveraging AIP to modernize ERP deployments in addition to finance, sales, and supply chain use cases. Kinder Morgan signed a 5-year Foundry and AIP enterprise expansion with production use cases, including storage optimization, pipeline integrity monitoring, and power optimization. These are just a handful of the significant expansions last quarter into production with AIP, and the magnitude of expansion is notable.\nA major North American industrial company started working with us in late 2022, expanded to a $5 million run rate in 2023 and further deepened engagement to a $20 million run rate this year. One of America's leading hospitals began working with us in 2021, generated approximately $1.5 million of revenue in 2022, over $4 million of revenue in 2023, and is on track to generate nearly $15 million of revenue this year.\nWith regard to landing new customers, U.S. commercial customer count grew 83% year-over-year last quarter. Bootcamps remain a key go-to-market motion, particularly for prototyping what is possible with AI, but the real opportunity and our unique capability lies in moving from prototype to production with these customers. That is where we are focused. We closed a 7-figure deal with a large wholesale insurance brokerage firm for an initial production automated policy review use case just 16 days after the Bootcamp. A leading convenience store chain went from prototype out of Bootcamp to paid pilot in 25 days, then converted the inventory management and pricing optimization use case into initial production immediately following the pilot.\nOur product charisma remains unparalleled. We plan to leverage this combination of Bootcamps and pilots with a focus on moving towards high-value production use cases to continue landing new customers. At the same time, we are heightening our concentration towards building deep production-level relationships with every single customer. The phenomenal strength of our U.S. government business shows the power and scale of our enterprise software delivery. Our U.S. government business continued accelerating, growing more than 8% sequentially for 2 consecutive quarters.\nWe proudly received several notable awards last quarter, including a production contract from the Department of Defense Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, CDAO, to deploy and scale an AI-enabled operating system across the DoD, starting with an initial order of $153 million to support certain combatant commands and the joint staff, while additional awards can be made up to $480 million over a 5-year period. This award reflects the criticality of our software and our nation's defense capabilities.\nShortly after, CDAO announced a new initiative, Open DAGIR, to enable defense tech companies, traditional contractors, and government developers to develop applications and integrations on top of Maven powered by Palantir in a contract worth $33 million. We maintain pride in the mission-critical impact of our products and celebrate the long-term strength of our U.S. government business, evident in last quarter's results.\nLooking ahead, I've never felt more bullish about our business than I do today. We're charging full steam ahead, leading our customers across the bridge from prototype to production with our ever-expanding product capabilities, laying the path for that journey. I'll now turn it over to Shyam to share more details.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. Our customers have been ahead of investors and markets. Customers choose us not because we're delivering proofs of concepts but because we deliver proof, years of foundational investments in our infrastructure and in particular, in Ontology, I'll note a widely ignored and discounted innovation have put us in the pole position. Gen AI has made prototyping incredibly easy and charismatic but with the same utility of a PowerPoint slide.\nThe journey to production, as the market is now discovering, is fraught and requires a foundational set of technologies that we have uniquely invested in, creating a product pipeline that's needed to harvest economic value from AI. And that's a journey that we were pathfinders on with the U.S. Department of Defense starting in 2018 and one we continue to be the leaders in across both segments, government and commercial today.\nThe bottleneck and the transition from prototype to production is a very hard set of technical problems. We didn't build those technologies eating berries in San Francisco. We had to be on the factory floor, in the foxhole, eating pain with our customers, seeing the secret truths of what does and doesn't work and metabolizing it into product. This has always been the secret of Palantir. It is the anti playbook.\nToday's AIP developers will be the enterprise's next generation of builders. Apollo delivers eye-watering agility and responsiveness. AIP deprecates back-end development the same way that hyperscalers deprecated infrastructure, providing the mechanism to bring AI into production in the enterprise quickly. Our builder investments are feeding our product pipeline with our customers, developers in the wild. Compute modules have enabled the integration of our customers' own containerized applications into operational workflows.\nToday, this technology is powering exquisite missile warning systems in the U.S. government and sophisticated production plan optimization across commercial. In Ontology, SDK has enabled customers to build their own pro code applications backed by Ontology, the critical ingredient for harnessing LLMs in the enterprise. And we pulled all these investments together in code workspaces where we have enabled an end-to-end development environment that lets customers treat their business as code.\nThese investments have made us the emerging choice not only for application developers but also data scientists. Our platforms have become the fastest place for our customers to develop, refine, and manage not only their models but integrated offerings that deliver business impact. And once again, history is repeating itself with data scientists as they abandon the thin playbook products of the past.\nWe recently hosted 2 champions road events, 1 in Denver and 1 in Munich that pulled together the most experienced and prolific customer developers to share the latest on our road map, but more importantly, to surface new opportunities to go deeper. At build.palantir.com, developers in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and India, amongst a growing list of countries, can now access a free developer tier in a library of quick starts, tutorials and reference implementations for themselves.\nThis developer movement is matched on the government side, whether it's with developers in Armed Forces Ukraine or the U.S. Army. In government, CDAO's recent contract award on Maven will enable us to scale those exquisite capabilities to the DoD enterprise and to bring integrated JADC2 capabilities across space, cyber, electronic warfare, and logistics. The CDAO Open DAGIR contract also enables defense tech companies, traditional contractors, and government developers to leverage Apollo in the Ontology software development kit, OSDK, to develop applications and integrations on top of Maven, all powered by Palantir's Mission Manager.\nAnd finally, fresh out of the AIP product pipeline, we are launching a new offering, Warp Speed to power American reindustrialization. The software playbooks have also failed in manufacturing. And all the founders driving reindustrialization know it. This is why SpaceX built their own ERP. We created Warp Speed from our years of experience on the factory floors, helping customers build planes, trains, automobiles, and even ships. Today, we power production of jet engines, satellites, and weapon systems in the industrial base.\nWarp Speed, built on AIP, on our industrial AI and with Ontology, is the modern American manufacturing operating system that reimagines how to bend atoms better with bits. At the dawn of World War II, we didn't have a defense industrial base. We had an American industrial base. Chrysler made missiles, and General Mills wasn't just a cereal company. This is also what our future must look like. It is clear that the nation must reindustrialize and mobilize at warp speed to win. This platform will transform production in the value chains that power our kill chains. I'll turn it over to Dave to talk us through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. Q2 was an exceptional quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 27% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 5%, driven by the strength in our U.S. commercial and government businesses. On the back of this strength, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance midpoint to $2.746 billion, representing a 23% year-over-year growth rate. We delivered these tremendous top line results while expanding adjusted operating margin to 37%, highlighting the strong unit economics of our business.\nWe also delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, generating a record $134 million of GAAP net income and our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, generating a record $105 million of GAAP operating income. Our revenue and profitability drove a 7-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 57 in the first quarter to 64 in the second quarter.\nTurning to our global top line results. Revenue continues to accelerate. We generated $678 million in revenue, up 27% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter revenue grew 30% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Customer count grew 41% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to 593 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Second quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 9% year-over-year to $57 million per customer.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. Second quarter commercial revenue grew 33% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $307 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Second quarter commercial TCV book was $377 million, representing 31% growth year-over-year. Our U.S. commercial business continues to see unprecedented demand, with AIP driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S.\nSecond quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $159 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 70% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. In the second quarter, we booked $262 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing 152% growth year-over-year. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 103% year-over-year and 11% sequentially.\nOur U.S. commercial customer account grew to 295 customers, reflecting 83% growth year-over-year and 13% growth sequentially. We generated $148 million in international commercial revenue in the second quarter, representing 15% growth year-over-year and 1% sequential decline as a result of continued headwinds in Europe. We continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East, and beyond.\nRevenue from strategic commercial contracts declined to $9 million for the quarter. We anticipate third quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to continue to decline to between $6 million to $8 million compared to $15 million in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to be less than 2% of full year revenue.\nShifting to our government segment. Second quarter government revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $371 million. Second quarter U.S. government revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $278 million. As Ryan mentioned, we were selected for several notable awards in Q2, which led to the strongest U.S. government bookings quarter since 2022, reflecting the growing demand for our government software offerings.\nSecond quarter international government revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $93 million, primarily driven by additional funding from a partner nation related to our ongoing efforts in Eastern Europe. Second quarter TCV booked was $946 million, up 47% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 114%, an increase of 300 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q2 of last year. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it has not yet fully captured the acceleration in velocity in our U.S. commercial business over the past year.\nWe ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, and $1.4 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 41% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 83% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, was $254 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 37% and marking the seventh consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Q2 adjusted expense was $425 million, up 4% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. We continue to expect expenses to ramp through the back half of the year as we invest in the product pipeline and hard technical problems in debottlenecking the journey from prototype to production that Shyam just outlined.\nWe remain focused, however, on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability and operating income. In the second quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $105 million, representing a 16% margin, our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income and fifth consecutive quarter of expanding GAAP operating margins. We generated second quarter GAAP net income of $134 million, representing a 20% margin, our seventh consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.09 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.06. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 64% in the first quarter, a 7-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $144 million in cash from operations and $149 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 21% and 22%, respectively. We expect cash flow to ramp through the back half of the year, in line with the expected timing of government and commercial year-end collections. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $973 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q3 2024, we expect: revenue of between $697 million and $701 million; and adjusted income from operations of between $233 million and $237 million. For full year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.742 billion and $2.750 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $672 million, representing a growth rate of at least 47%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $966 million and $974 million. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of between $800 million and $1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThank you for participating in our earnings. We founded this company to be a ray of light to America and our Western allies. And in doing so, we built software for the institutions as they ought to exist, not as they do exist. And of course, the whole playbook around building software, building institutional software, building software that would be transformative and especially in the current context around AI and large language models flew in the face of everything that people have been taught to know about enterprises, what makes them work, how they can transform themselves, what software products would be valuable, what software products people would adopt, how would they adopt them, how would you get value from analyst users in the software context, how would you transform manufacturing, how would you use in the current context of large language models, not as an act of self-flagellation or something that just makes a small group of people richer.\nBut in a way that you can extract value in existential life and death context like the battlefield or in institutional or commercial context like the transformation that is happening all across America and in some other countries. And in the face of this, we made bold claims that looked ridiculous to many people. One bold claim was these large language models will not work without foundational software. They will not work without a means to process them. They will stay something like self-pleasuring or PowerPoints, which is the purveyor which are sold to institutions as a way of deceiving institutions from transferring their high-value revenue to other enterprises without actually transforming themselves, which were addictive and thin and led to dysfunction in enterprises, much like their allegory in the political world of woke-ism became slower, dumber, not able to actually produce results.\nAnd we built the infrastructure you need to move from self-flagellation, PowerPoints, and prototypes flawlessly into production. Production meaning your enterprise gets faster, it runs better. The margins are better. The people inside the enterprise become more valuable. Your tribal knowledge and your enterprise, the knowledge which differentiates you from all other enterprises, becomes truly valuable. It becomes a weapon in your hand, whether that weapon is in the commercial context, to make what you know how to do better than anyone else work better than anyone else, by making engineers better, by making the workers more able to do things engineers would be able to do, by treating your company as a portfolio as opposed to dots on a PowerPoint.\nWe believed, and the numbers now show that we were right, that by doing this, we could give America and its allies a structural advantage in the commercial area, which we have seen and our numbers prove and arguably even more importantly, on the battlefield, which we can't talk as much about but is the absolute most important area where America and its allies have to have dominance and leadership, that we had a structural advantage. And what is gratifying about our -- this quarter and, in general, about what we've done is not the banality that we were right and the playbook purveyors are obviously somewhat laughable. It is that you can build a great business, be aligned with America and the West, that, that alignment will make you stronger and better, that your software products will actually be products and not PowerPoints and that you can actually build something with the best people in the world, the best investors in the world that will lead to structural advantages.\nOf course, all along the way, we had many, many doubters. We had people that thought we would never be profitable. We had -- now we are over 7 quarters in profitability. thought people that we would never be able to grow the revenue. We'd never be able to reaccelerate the U.S. government because of its -- it's often opaque, but we asserted that product superiority would overcome many of the vicissitudes and difficulties of working with the U.S. government witness reacceleration. We asserted that our products were the precursor to making LLMs valuable, that we would productize how you create this value much the way hyperscalers, as Shyam had mentioned, have productized other technical issues and that we would give those, that productization to our customers.\nWitness our 70% after [indiscernible] quarter -- the third quarter in a row where we're growing at what amounts to a ridiculous rate. And there's a witness of the reacceleration of our global business ex to 30%. Witness our backlog, look at any part of our business, then it is like, well, how are we doing? This is a really long, interesting question that people will dedicate their academic careers on but we do not have time to address and it may not be learnable for everyone, but we do, do it.\nAnd the single most important part, however, of this is that we are going to play a determinant role in making America and its Western allies the dominant force again in this world. And because of that, the best times for this company are not in the past. I would say the single most interesting thing about this quarter, if you had to reduce it to 1 simple fact after 20 years, after changing the way people do intel, after changing the way the battlefield works, after changing the way people procure software, after exporting our platforms to our allies, after punishing our adversaries, after building a commercial business, after DPO, after seeing it all reaccelerate, the best times for us are yet to come, and we are planning to just take our energy and run this business as a business at which we are, which is our owners.\nWe are owners with a very long-term focus for the best interest of our country, our allies, and our Palantirians, and our investors. And so I'm very thrilled to have you participate in this, what for us, means historic earnings. And last not least, the world is on the precipice of what could be a very severe set of violent interactions in the Middle East. And it goes without saying that at Palantir, we know where we stand and we are very much supporting America and its allies in the Middle East, including Israel. Thank you.",

Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today.\nOur press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.\nOver the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer.\nI'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe started the year exceedingly strong with revenue of $634 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year driven by the momentum of AIP and our continued strong performance in U.S. commercial. Our results also highlight the growing strength of our U.S. government business and our enduring mission-critical work. The continued interest in AIP is loud and clear in the conversations I'm having across our customer base. We've shared our plans to capture the market with AIP, and our results show that our strategy is not only succeeding it is accelerating.\nWhile still early days, our focus is on building the foundations of a long-term business. We intend to relentlessly continue landing new customers and subsequently expanding those engagements as our products gain traction and have meaningful impact within enterprises. Not only are we increasing the volume of new customers, but I'm pleased with our ability to grow these new customers as well.\nWith regards to landing new customers, we've sustained our high volume of boot camps with over 915 organizations participating to date to meet inbound demand. We are also seeing substantial deal cycle compression. As one example, a leading utility company, signed a 7-figure deal just 5 days after completing a boot camp. Another customer immediately signed a paid engagement after just one day of their multi-day boot camp and then converted to a 7-figure deal 3 weeks later.\nWe expect the favorable unit economics and higher throughput to continue to accelerate our business. U.S. commercial is where we're seeing the greatest transformation. While Q1 is seasonally our slowest quarter, AIP adoption by new and existing customers helped drive notable growth in customer acquisition and revenue in our U.S. commercial business.\nIn Q1, we added 41 net new customers in U.S. commercial. Our customer count increased 69% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter, compared to 8% quarter-over-quarter growth in Q1 2023, excluding strategic investments, our U.S. commercial revenue soared by 68% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter.\nNew customers span a variety of industries, as AIPs applications seem endless. From the largest independent bottling company in the U.S. to a leading energy and infrastructure company and a multinational airline. In Q1, our U.S. commercial business had customers from 56 of the 74 gigs industries. As we're landing new customers, we're also seeing those customers expanding their work with us.\nAcross my conversations with customers, I've seen the recurring theme of them asking me how they can do more, faster with enterprise transformations driven by AI. We're showing them how they can move their AI strategy beyond chat. Existing customers such as Lowe's, Cleveland Clinic and General Mills, among others, are realizing the extensive possibilities of AIP within their own enterprises and increasing their scope accordingly.\nLowe's accelerated its engagement from a starting point of no AI to utilizing production level AI for over 1,000 customer service agents, resulting in a 75% reduction in overdue tasks, as one of its directors noted, \"we achieved this in just 4 months and onboarded 1,000 users within 3 weeks of rollout\".\nCleveland Clinic committed to a 10-year expansion deal to deploy more broadly across its hospitals. General Mills expanded the scope of its work further last quarter as its Senior Director noted, \"we're saving on average about $14 million annually, and it's really only deployed to part of our network as we speak\".\nWe're seeing rapid expansions within key customer accounts. For example, a Fortune 500 industrial company signed a 3-year expansion deal, which increased the annual revenue run rate of our work with them nearly fivefold compared to our initial engagement with them in 2022. A Fortune 100 retail company started a pilot in Q2 2023, expanded to a use case conversion in August and expanded its work to a $12 million ACV enterprise engagement last quarter. These are just a few examples. More and more customers are expanding their work with us due to AIP and the incredible traction our software has within their organizations.\nTurning to our U.S. government business. Our revenue continued to accelerate last quarter, increasing 8% quarter-over-quarter versus 3% quarter-over-quarter in Q4, with our products every day having critical impact on current world events. We see continued demand for Mission Manager and positive reception to First Breakfast.\nLast quarter, we were honored the U.S. Army awarded Palantir, over $178 million to be the sole prime contractor to build a next-generation targeting node under the TITAN program. This marks the first time that a software company has won a prime contract for a hardware system and exemplifies Palantir's position as the software prime, opening the door to vast new opportunities. It is with immense reference that we approach building and maturing our revolutionary capabilities for our war fighters.\nIn our international government business, we are continuing to ramp up the critical work for delivery of the U.K. NHS federated data platform as well as providing defense capabilities to Allied Partners around the world. Looking at our business and its impact broadly, I'm invigorated about the year ahead. We have never had more conviction about AIP and the power of our software as well as our continued efforts supporting the most critical missions around the globe.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. The clear signal from AIP boot camps is that AI is for builders, so many anecdotes and quotes from customers all reinforcing the same point. They are getting more done in a day or 2 in AIP than in a quarter or 2 without. We have pioneered the approach to getting beyond chat and unlocking the value of LOMs in the enterprise, taking inherently unstructured inputs that are flying around the enterprise, be it e-mails, slacks, PDFs, images, comments, audio and turning them into structured actions and outputs.\nTaking an e-mail from a customer requesting a different product mix and turning it into an actual inventory allocation in the ERP system of record. Taking a health claims denial and programmatically generating the documentation and supporting evidence from the clinical records and contracts, automating P&C insurance claims processing and even in government using vision models to narrow candidate products driving foodborne outbreaks at CDC.\nAnd we have started rolling out Build with AIP, a series of developer and builder oriented tutorials and reference implementations that enable builders to ramp quickly on the primitives and power of AIP and practical examples that unlock every employee at every customer. Our growth is being driven by the incredible dynamism of the U.S. commercial market, and we believe the U.S. government will follow.\nWith this momentum, we have launched builder boot camps in the U.S. government. U.S. Army recently issued a memo identifying 2 Palantir systems, AIDP and Army Vantage as amongst the 5 total platforms approved for builders. The U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center, AI2C at Carnegie Mellon, leverages these platforms for half of their active projects and recently built an application for the 18th Airborne core with OSTK.\nOur DoD customer recently hosted a hackathon showing the value of the open joint all-domain command and control or JADC2 SDK that we have been pioneering. One participant commented, nominating targets with Gyasis turns a 6-hour workflow into 10 seconds. We continue to invest in Mission Manager, and we'll be extending it to the edge with our Edge X infrastructure and U.S. government.\nNow customers can use their cloud instance as an integrated development environment for edge platforms, centrally build, test and continuously deploy and manage multivendor big tech edge ecosystems. It covers everything from streaming pipelines, OSDK-backed applications, native Gotham applications and third-party apps.\nWe are excited with our team of Rockstar partners to deliver on the U.S. Army's Titan program. This marks the first time a software company has won a hardware contract, firmly establishing the role of the software prime. We believe the core of this software target workbench will be critical in every cockpit, every vehicle and every ship.\nFinally, I'd like to acknowledge the eye-watering work of our service members and our allies in meeting the moment defending against the massive Iranian attack on Israel. The [indiscernible] JADC2 performed excellently, and we're building even more even faster.\nI'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. Q1 was a strong start to the year. Revenue growth accelerated to 21% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by momentum in AIP and our U.S. commercial business and a reacceleration in our U.S. Government business. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, generating a record $106 million of GAAP net income in the first quarter. We also delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, generating a record $81 million of GAAP operating income in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 36% in the first quarter continuing to highlight the strong unit economics of our business.\nThe revenue and profitability outperformance drove a 3-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 Score from 54 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 57 in the first quarter of 2024. This was the third consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 Score.\nTurning to our global top line results. We generated $634 million in revenue in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Customer count grew 42% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to 554 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. First quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 9% year-over-year to $55 million per customer.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. First quarter commercial revenue grew 27% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $299 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter commercial revenue grew 36% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We had a very strong quarter of commercial bookings. First quarter commercial TCV booked was $505 million, representing a 187% growth year-over-year.\nOur U.S. commercial business continues to see unprecedented demand driven by momentum from AIP. First quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $150 million, surpassing international commercial revenue for the first time. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts. First quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 22% sequentially.\nThe AIP is driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S. In the first quarter, we booked $286 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing 131% growth year-over-year. Total remaining yield value in our U.S. commercial business grew 74% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count [indiscernible] 262 customers, reflecting 69% growth year-over-year and 19% growth sequentially.\nWe generated $149 million in international commercial revenue in the first quarter, representing 16% growth year-over-year but a 3% sequential decline as a result of continued headwinds in Europe and the revenue catch up in Q4 that we noted last quarter. We continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $24 million in the quarter. We anticipate second quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to between $7 million to $9 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2023. We continue to anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to be approximately 2% of full year revenue.\nShifting to our Government segment. First quarter government revenue grew 16% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $335 million. First quarter U.S. government revenue grew 12% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $257 million. As Ryan noted, we're excited to be the sole prime contractor under the Titan program, and we'll continue pursuing other defense opportunities. We believe we're well positioned to see growth in our U.S. government business over the course of 2024.\nFirst quarter international government revenue grew 33% year-over-year and declined 9% sequentially to $79 million as a result of the revenue catch-up in Q4 that we noted last quarter and continued headwinds in Europe. First quarter TCV booked was $904 million, up 128% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 111%, an increase of 300 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q1 of last year. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that are acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration of velocity in our U.S. commercial business over the past year.\nWe ended the first quarter with $4.1 billion in total remaining yield value, an increase of 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially and $1.3 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 39% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 83% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $226 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 36% and marking the sixth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Q1 adjusted expense was $408 million, up 2% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.\nTurning to the balance of the year. Given our conviction in the U.S. business, coupled with our margin expansion, we intend to boost investment in resources in the U.S., including an AIP and specific defense opportunities. While we expect expenses to ramp starting in Q2 through the back half of the year, we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goal of sustained GAAP profitability and GAAP operating income.\nIn the first quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $81 million, representing a 13% margin, our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income and fourth consecutive quarter of expanding GAAP operating margins. We generated first quarter GAAP net income of $106 million, representing a 17% margin, our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.08 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.04.\nAdditionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 57% in the first quarter, a 3-point increase to our Rule of 40 Score from the prior quarter. We will continue to strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the first quarter, we generated $130 million in cash from operations and $149 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 20% and 23%, respectively.\nIn Q1, we also repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately 990 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury securities. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q2 2024, we expect revenue of between $649 million and $653 million and adjusted income from operations of between $209 million and $213 million. For full year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.677 billion and $2.689 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $661 million, representing a growth rate of at least 45%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $868 million and $880 million. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of between $800 million and $1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our Q1 earnings. I think it is fair to say we crushed Q1 in the U.S. We are on fire. You see this in our rule of 7, a Rule of 40 being 57, you see it in, the 6% growth in U.S. commercial, if you do apples-to-apples following on 70% growth last quarter or 71% if you do apples-to-apples, taking out a SPAC revenue. You see it in the deal growth in the U.S. growing from 70 to 136 in a year. You see it in the general enthusiasm around our products, especially in commercial, but also in government, which has begun to reaccelerate. You see it in general in our customer growth in U.S. comm, which grew 69%.\nAnd again, we are growing these numbers while maintaining a Rule of 40 Score of 57, which basically means we're doing the impossible. We are growing the company while investing in our core IP or software development, we are winning in the U.S. And then that kind of asked -- then leads to the question of why are we doing so well in the United States of America?\nAnd the main reason is we built software infrastructure that allows enterprises, both commercial and government, to move beyond chat, move beyond self pleasuring to actually produce things that are valuable and whether this is tasking satellites in the commercial context or changing margins or changing American workers into Japanese engineers using our software platform and large language models. You can -- we believe -- I believe we are the only company in America, the only really relevant market that will allow you to do useful things with large language models. And that is what's generating 68% growth in U.S. comm, again, with a nascent sales force, doing it in a way that is not kind of playbook specific, thin technology, it barely works, and you have a sales force, but with 10 years of IP that presupposed LLM before LLMs existed.\nYou see the same thing in the government, Shyam and others will talk about it, but our mission footprint, whether it's in Ukraine, Israel or in the United States government is stunning. There is basically no conflict in the world that is not -- that where Western allies are involved and the battlefields involved and the stakes are life and death, where Palantir is not the first call.\nAnd our ability to do this going forward is going to be even stronger because of the -- of past investments and also the unity of our culture and the strength of our leadership and in general, 20 years of understanding how to do this. It is true that it is mystifying to people, including analysts, how could this possibly be working? But it is working.\nAnd this is the sixth quarter of profitability, the sixth quarter of profitability. I dare, remind people that there was a time when no one thought we'd be profitable, when no one thought we could crack commercial, where revenue per person was called into question, that also grew roughly 26% year-on-year. Revenue per person generated at Palantir. We do have headwinds in Europe, 16% of our business in Europe. Europe is guiding towards 0% GDP growth over the next couple of years. That is a problem for us. There is no easy remedy for that. It is also the case, though, that U.S. comp surpassed U.S. European commercial and we see that as favorable. And I, in general, think this is just Palantir's time.\nNow there are lots of questions about why we are so active in defending the values of the West? The -- our belief that the West is a superior way to live and our ways of organizing around that are the reason why our products are transformative. The reason why we have the best people in the world. The reason why Palantir degree as it were is much more valuable than an Ivy League degree, before the Ivy League even embraced the thin new woke religion otherwise viewed as an intellectual cause, but in fact, is a way of organizing things so that the greatest institutions of our time disappear and turn into discriminatory dysfunction.\nPalantir is a counter example. And I'm super proud of the results. We are going to continue to execute, especially in the U.S., and I'm very happy to have you on the call.",

I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2024 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or use and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results.

Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website. at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\n2023 was a tremendous year of opportunity and growth for our company with U.S. commercial at the forefront, which was meaningfully driven by AIP as the product and boot camps as the go-to-market motion. We closed out the year with $608 million in fourth quarter revenue, representing 20% year-over-year and 9% sequential growth. Our commercial business surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months, a noteworthy milestone. And our fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 32% year-over-year. AIP and boot camps are accelerating our business particularly in U.S. commercial, where fourth quarter revenue grew 70% year-over-year, evidencing a significantly expanding addressable market. In October, we set a goal of executing 500 AIP boot camps within 1 year. We have already blown that go out of the water, having completed more than 560 boot camps across 465 organizations to date. We are deploying AIP to implement hundreds of real tangible use cases in production for our customers.\nOne boot camp attendee remarked \"what your team did in just 2 days was incredible. We can already think of 100 use cases for this.\" While another said, quote, \"it seems there are endless solutions. It seems there's nothing Palantir cannot do. \"\nWhen combining LLM with foundry through AIP the ability to deploy use cases becomes much more widely accessible. So the addressable market expands considerably. We're seeing initial momentum as a result of that expansion, while also still being at the starting line in the journey to capture that market. In our U.S. commercial business, the expanding addressable market driven by AIP is propelling growth both through new customer acquisitions and expansions with existing customers. I have never before seen the level of customer enthusiasm and demand that we are currently seeing from AIP and U.S. commercial. With regard to new customer acquisition, the expanding addressable market is reflected in the greater scale of the top of our sales funnel. And now we're doubling down on how we're converting boot camps to enterprise deals. We're already seeing evidence of boot camps helping to significantly compress sales cycles and accelerate the rate of new customer acquisition, which rose to 22% sequentially for U.S. commercial in Q4 versus 12% and 4% in Q3 and Q2, respectively. And we more than doubled the number of U.S. commercial deals with TCV of $1 million or more from the fourth quarter in 2022 to 2023.\nWe're also seeing a meaningful increase in our U.S. commercial TCV on a dollar-weighted duration basis, which is up 107% year-over-year and 42% sequentially. We signed a multitude of U.S. commercial deals last quarter. Just to name a few, we signed deals over $25 million each with one of the largest car rental companies. One of the largest telecommunication companies and one of the largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporations in the world. And then we also signed deals over $10 million each with an American consumer packaged goods holding company an American automotive seat and electrical systems manufacturer, a comprehensive health network in the Midwest and a large-scale battery manufacturer. In addition, we signed deals over $5 million each with an American bank holding company. a horseracing regulatory organization, one of the world's largest equipment rental companies and one of the largest independent nonprofit cooperatives in the quick service restaurant industry. And these are just a few of the examples. Out of these deals, we're seeing several architypes emerge as a result of AIP.\nFirst is the new customer who attends a boot camp and signs an enterprise contract shortly after. For instance, an American cable television provider signed a nearly $3 million deal following cold outreach on LinkedIn that led to a 5-day boot camp, then an enterprise agreement, all in the span of last quarter. Then there's AIP driven conversions of ongoing pilots. Following a 2-year prospecting effort, a large American consumer package goods holding company agreed to a pilot during which AIP was also introduced then converted in December to a 5-year $19 million contract. Then also AIP driven expansions in key existing accounts, including one of the world's largest telecommunication companies, where we demonstrated speed to value at Boot camps by delivering new use cases on top of the existing ontology in as little as 24 hours with the results contributing to an agreement for a multimillion dollar expansion of our existing contract. Within our international commercial business, AIP is solidifying our long-standing partnerships with existing customers, particularly in Continental Europe, while also driving pockets of growth in select markets.\nThis includes the renewal of our long-standing partnership with Novartis, a 5-year renewal with one of the largest European vehicle manufacturers and a 5-year renewal of our partnership with Swiss Re. In addition to boot camps, we are deepening distribution channels to more rapidly seize opportunities in certain regions, including Japan. In Q4, we expanded and extended our partnership with Fujitsu to enable them to bring AIP and data integration capabilities to their global client base. We also signed an expansion with [ Sample ] Care to enable delivery of their real data platform to nursing homes Alter care facilities. Both of these reflected a culmination of month-long efforts prior to deal closing. In our government business, we are actively engaged across all theaters of crisis and conflict. The strength of our U.S. government business is not reflected in the fourth quarter results, which remain muted. Some of this is due to the continuing resolution and timing of large potential contract awards. But it's also a function of the department's pace of scaling their AI and software efforts to match the realities of modern combat, particularly with [ JADC2 ]. The department is responding to great power competition by ramping up investments in America's unique strength, software.\nWe are focused on deploying on the battlefield and in large programs related to [ JADC2 ], combined with our rollout of Mission Manager and the first breakfast initiatives, which is driving innovation in our engagement model with the government and the defense industrial base. The Army has publicly indicated they anticipate down selection to a single vendor for the next phase of Titan to occur in Q2 of 2024. We also announced the extension of our partnership with the Army to continue operating and enhancing the Army Vantage platform, which is used for data-driven operations and decision-making. We will continue to onboard partners and demonstrate the value of Mission manager during this option year to deliver on the Army's multivendor ecosystem vision. On the strength of our work on the ground and our software that actually works, we expect reacceleration of our U.S. government business in 2024. Conventional wisdom is that government acquisitions are slow, and then you need to invest in the programs that the government is buying in a 2- to 3-year acquisition cycle, and that's what programs like CD1, AIDP, Vantage and Titan look like.\nBut our business has also been driven by urgent acquisitions to meet emergent needs that we predicted and invested in years ahead of time. As the U.S. confronts conflict in 3 theaters and as all services seek rapid capabilities to meet those moments, we see substantial opportunity across the department. Turning to our international government business. We are incredibly honored that the NHS chose Palantir to help deliver a federated data platform, awarding us a consumption-based contract with GBP 330 million allocated to improve patient care by bringing together the information needed to plan and deliver care while reducing administrative burden. Over the past few years, an increasing number of NHS Trusts have used the software to reduce the care backlog. For example, and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust. It helped bring down the inpatient waiting list by 28% and operations canceled on day due to mispreoperative assessments, subsequently fell by half. In the fourth quarter, we also received funding from a partner nation related to our ongoing efforts in Eastern Europe, which had a substantial impact on our international government results.\nRecent world events and global conflicts, illustrate the utmost importance of Palantir's mission. It's our duty to uphold our founding principles through our continued dedication to our allies in the midst of current events. We don't take this lightly. Last month, we held our Board meeting in Tel Aviv, where I saw firsthand our commitment to and support for Israel. While there, we were proud to announce our strategic partnership to supply the Israeli Defense Ministry technology to aid in addressing the current situation in Israel. My experience there was a humbling reminder of the role we play and the responsibility that we hold. Reflecting on 2023, we feel immense pride in the missions we are supporting and in our role, shepherding our customers through the ongoing transformation of their enterprises with AIP. This ongoing transformation isn't just limited to our customers. I'm proud of the incredible transformation of our enterprise in 2023, and I'm excited about what it will bring in 2024 as we conquer the expanding market. I'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. As Ryan mentioned, the expanding addressable market, driven by AIP is propelling growth both through new customer acquisitions and expansions with existing customers. We continue to focus on accelerating the rate of boot camps with current and prospective customers. From customer feedback, the AI platform meets this moment like none other. AI has radically recalibrated customer expectations for software. Expectations at AIP and foundry exceed by enabling the elegant integration of humans, software and AI to deliver operational outcomes quickly. We are focused on the end-to-end problem of value creation, not a small, narrow technical slice. Accordingly, our platforms focus on tools, not tuning on transforming business processes, not seeking iota of insight. AIP is the AI-powered operating system for the enterprise, not a Q&A but, not an agent framework, not a way to dabble, but a way to deliver. At a recent 2-day boot camp with the construction and engineering and architecture company, our customer developed a production-ready use case that provided $10 million of savings. They used AIP to build an AI-powered disruption manager application that processes production disruption notifications through AIP Logic to determine what the best new production plan would be.\nAIP, wielding a linear optimizer as a tool and using LMs to parameterize and contextualize the disruption translates the notification to a clear understanding of impact on the optimized schedule. AIP logic and AIP automate then rerun the optimizer to generate opportunities to respond to disruption, 2 days, $10 million. We have covered nearly 200 use cases coming out of all these boot camps, and we are just getting started. The core theory of value that has driven our product strategy for time [ eternal ] is data integration, that bringing new data into an operationally relevant context to expand the complexity, nuance and surface area of decision-making always produces value. AIP enables us to integrate so many types of new data, video conferences, incident response calls, slack rooms, PDFs, images, video, audio and exploit them through the power of LLMs and oncology. So much of what data defines a process is not actually in the system that runs that process but instead in conversations, conference calls, videos of the factory floor or images of a site.\nWhat's in the enterprise process system is a [ lossy ] latent representation of this reality. Our software always exploited that phenomenon that the truth is out there, not in your ERP system or that blessedbless application. With AIP, we are investing in multimodal approaches to compound on this proven value driver and expand the addressable market of use cases within the enterprise. As I've said before, with AI and LLM, you can't think your way through it. You have to get your hands dirty and work in anger to get use cases into production. In AIP, we have built a platform to deliver proof not just proofs of concept to our customers. And boot camps are the way to flex that strength. At AIPCon 3, we'll have many customers on stage showing you their great work, come taste the pudding. Turning to government. Palantir is experiencing its own Amazon.com to AWS moment, taking exquisite first-party technology that supports the largest scale defense tech player and making it available for third parties to build on and win. Gotham, Gaia, MetaConstellation. This is our software, less well understood and now being commercialized is our software infrastructure, platforms like Apollo, the capabilities that we had to build over 20 years to enable hundreds of dev teams to independently release 2,500 products and services to nearly 1,000 customer environments, including about 100 airgap environments, delivering 90,000 upgrades a week.\nThis infrastructure abstracts away supply chain security, environment, heterogeneity and infrastructure so that developers can be operationally responsible for their services across it all, so they can focus on delivering innovation to the war fighter. And that's exactly why the Palantir government web services offering is so compelling. $100 billion has been invested by venture capitalists into Defense Tech since 2021. These companies want to compete on quality, not beating back bureaucracy. Government web services creates a capital and time-efficient way to unlock market access for new entrants and incumbents alike. But even beyond defense tech companies, an extended set of these capabilities that we call Mission Manager, are uniquely suited to delivering the capabilities that we have heard all government PMs asking for. Program offices want to pursue multi-vendor big tent ecosystem acquisition strategies with government-owned and managed interfaces.\nThe typical way to pursue this is with a systems integrator where they are managing the integration with billable hours constrained by humans. At Palantir, we do this with software, as a software integrator, we see a more significant market opportunity in Mission Manager and government web services over the long term than C2, Intel and data platforms alone. We have already launched Mission Manager projects, starting with the U.S. Army, a customer whose needs and feedback have heavily shaped this offering. We continue to invest in relationships with the defense industrial base to help them bend metal more profitably and efficiently. In their earnings calls, America's prime signal that they're pulling back from getting substantially burned on firm fixed price contracts. This is a giant step in the wrong direction for America. So we want to lean in and help them optimize their supply chains, their production plans, quality and overall delivery against these contracts that have enormous opportunity to generate margin for them. But we are also working aggressively with new entrants to start with foundry as their production software from day 0.\n[ MDA ] was yesterday. We have no time to waste to mobilize America's industrial base to ramp production. Finally, our products could not be playing a more central role for real-world events. Our AI-enabled platforms are being leveraged maximally to support key U.S. government goals in the Middle East. We have served support to Israel to enable the Israeli defense forces and intelligent services to leverage Gaia, Gotham, Foundry and AIP to tackle a growing list of use cases from tactical command and control, visual intelligence, forensics, readiness and production. At the same time, great power competition with China remains top of mind as we continue to invest in moving more of Palantir's mass west of the international dateline. And we continue to support Ukraine's efforts directly and through allies. When the bat signal goes up, Palantir's Gotham platform and its family of products have always answered the call. At the same time, monetization of these efforts will take time. The principal reason is that the DoD is at the very beginning of a long-term allocation shift from hardware to software. For example, the Army is spending a mere 0.015% of its budget on command and control software in fiscal year '24. But as we confront crisis and conflict in 3 theaters, this is changing. Growth is being driven by the incredible dynamism of the U.S. commercial market and U.S. government will follow. With that, I'll hand it over to Dave to talk us through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. We had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, marked by our outperformance across revenue, profitability and cash flow. Revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in Q4 on the back of our U.S. commercial business, which alone grew 70% year-over-year, a result driven by momentum in AIP. Adjusted operating margin continued to expand to 34% in the fourth quarter, highlighting the strong unit economics of our business. We meet the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and adjusted operating margin, driving an 800 basis point sequential increase to a rule 40 score from 46% in the third quarter to 54 in the fourth quarter. We also delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. In 2023, we generated $210 million of GAAP net income, a $584 million increase from 2022. In the fourth quarter alone, we generated nearly $100 million in GAAP net income. We also delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, generating $120 million of GAAP operating income in 2023 and a $281 million increase year-over-year.\nOur GAAP operating profit accelerated in each quarter of last year, and in the fourth quarter alone, GAAP operating income increased 65% sequentially to $66 million, our highest quarter ever of GAAP operating income. We generated over $300 million in adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter, representing a margin of 50% and and over $730 million of adjusted free cash flow for the full year. Turning to our global top line results. Fourth quarter revenue accelerated to $608 million, up 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We generated $2.23 billion of revenue in 2023, representing a growth rate of 17% year-over-year. We generated $1.38 billion in total U.S. revenue in 2023, representing a growth rate of 19% year-over-year.\nExcluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter revenue grew 20% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, and full year revenue grew 20% year-over-year. Customer count grew 35% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to 497 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. For trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 11% year-over-year to $55 million per customer. Now moving to our commercial segment. Fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 32% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to $284 million. Full year commercial revenue grew 20% year-over-year to over $1 billion, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 35% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, and full year commercial revenue grew 28% year-over-year. Fourth quarter commercial TCV book was $699 million, our highest commercial TCV quarter in the company's history, representing 156% growth year-over-year and 74% growth sequentially.\nLast quarter, our U.S. commercial business saw rapid acceleration in unprecedented demand. Fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 70% year-over-year and 12% sequentially to $131 million. Full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $457 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year-over-year and 8% sequentially and and full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 52% year-over-year. Our momentum in AIP is driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions. The transformation that AIP is having on our business is best highlighted in our U.S. commercial bookings and backlog. In the fourth quarter, we booked $343 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing 107% growth year-over-year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 32% year-over-year and 28% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 221 customers, reflecting 55% growth year-over-year and 20% growth sequentially. Fourth quarter international commercial revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $154 million as we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond.\nAs Ryan mentioned, we've been capturing value and footprint from AIP momentum, and two examples are from our work with Fujitsu and Sompo. These customers have been using AIP for months prior to the deal's closing, resulting in some revenue catch-up last quarter. Full year international commercial revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $546 million. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $20 million for the quarter. We anticipate first quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to between $14 million to $16 million compared to $33 million in the first quarter of 2023. We anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to approximately 2% of full year revenue compared to approximately 4% of revenue in 2023. Shifting to our Government segment. Fourth quarter government revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $324 million. Full year government revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $1.22 billion.\nFourth quarter U.S. government revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $237 million. Full year U.S. government revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $921 million. As Ryan mentioned, while our fourth quarter U.S. government results are muted due to the timing of larger contract awards, we expect our U.S. government business to reaccelerate in 2024. Fourth quarter international government revenue grew 27% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $87 million, bolstered by our work in health care and defense. This included the receipt of funding from a partner nation related to our ongoing efforts in Eastern Europe which resulted in a revenue catch-up for the quarter. Full year international government revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $301 million. We had an outstanding quarter of bookings. Fourth quarter TCV booked was $1.15 billion, up 192% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 108%, an increase of 100 basis points from last quarter. Net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that we acquired in the past 12 months and therefore, does not yet fully capture the acceleration in our U.S. commercial business. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.9 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 5% sequentially and $1.2 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 26% sequentially.\nAs a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience causes both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 84% for the quarter and 82% for the year. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $209 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 34% and and marking the fifth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Full year adjusted income from operations was $633 million, representing march of 28% and a 600 basis point increase compared to 2022. Q4 adjusted expense was $399 million, up 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Full year adjusted expense was $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Our bottom line outperformance in 2023 has positioned us to be able to escalate investment and resources to AIP.\nAs a result, we expect expenses to increase in Q1, but we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability and operating income. In the fourth quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $66 million, representing an 11% margin, our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income. Full year GAAP operating income was $120 million. We generated fourth quarter GAAP net income of $93 million, representing a 15% margin, our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Full year GAAP net income was $210 million. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.08 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.04. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $0.25 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.09. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 54% in the fourth quarter, an 800 basis point increase to our Rural 40 score from the prior quarter. We continue to strive to maintain its exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we generated $301 million in cash from operations and $305 million in adjusted free cash flow, both representing a margin of 50%. In 2023, we generated $712 million in cash flow from operations and $731 million in adjusted free cash flow. We ended Q4 with $3.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn. Now turning to our outlook. For Q1 2024, we expect revenue of between $612 million and $616 million, adjusted income from operations of between $196 million and $200 million for full year 2024, we expect revenue of between $2.652 billion and $2.668 billion, U.S. commercial revenue in excess of $640 million, representing a growth rate of at least 40% and adjusted income from operations of between $834 million and $850 million, adjusted free cash flow of between $800 million and $1 billion, GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our earnings. There's really so much to say. Obviously, our performance in U.S. commercial is extraordinary. Some would say bombastic. The numbers that just fly off the screen or year-on-year growth in Q4. The numbers that I almost had to turn the page when I saw them, were the over 100 contracts over $1 million, $37 million, over $5 million and $21 million, roughly over $10 million. There is -- it's almost inconceivable to do that many contracts given the way our product used to be. And so what you see is a convergence of our product being easier to use an augmentation of its [ charisma ], both driven by developments in AI, large language models, which make the product approachable foundry to the broader market. You also see just this enormous demand and our ability to meet that demand with a pilot -- new piloting approach that we call Boot Camp. So we went like 2 years ago, we did 92 pilots. And last year, really mostly the second half of the year, we did over 500 boot camps. I go around the country now, telling CEO, CTOs and whoever has a $1 million to buy our product and transform their enterprise take everything you've done in AI since you started, put your best people on it and we're going to show up at any time you want, and we're going to run your data at a boot camp for 10 hours. And then you compare your self pleasuring to our operationally relevant commercially valuable critical to your enterprise results. Our 10 hours your 10 months. Any products you want, any vendor you want, any hyperscaler you want, you pick them, we'll show up.\nThe reaction to this -- because what America is obviously realized is this is real. But if you took the total number of people -- total number of enterprises that are doing AI of any kind, including algebra and said it would be probably less than the 300. We have 300 customers that are creating operational results using our AIP pro operational, meaning defining how you want, I'm defining it as they'll pay $1 million or more for it. So it's real. And we're doing this at a scale and pace that is inconceivable for Palantir up until recently. And you just have a number after number after number interface after interfaces. This is -- there are some caveats Europe has decided that they are not going to engage in this revolution. There are other caveats for our society. I don't want to spend too much time on that, but the winners are going to win more. This is a revolution for incumbents that have distribution and already strong products, which is why we're massively outperforming. There are some caveats for us internally. We're having to rebuild the whole system, our whole company to deal with this demand. We have a latent nascent sales force that has put its tiny toe in the water and is noticed it can move around. We have to build that into a strong, aggressive machine.\nThere are some positive caveats. We're doing this our way. We are not -- we are proud of our work on the front. We are proud that we support the U.S. We are proud that we support the U.S. military. We are proud to have an operational crucial role in Ukraine, and I am exceedingly proud that after October 7, within weeks, we are on the ground, and we are involved in operationally crucial operations in Israel. I know of no other software company in the world that has been engaged by Ukraine and Israel or in general, I'm not sure they buy a bot software from any other company at our scale. These are momentous events built on the back of a 20-year assumption that software would define our reality. The winners would be those that understood software, rejecting linear, narrow sales-driven software, Frankenstein Monster infrastructures that have been so historically popular for investment in Silicon Valley, rejecting [ Sophism ] as not only approach to business, meaning I can only say what I believe if it doesn't matter or I never say what I believe, those assumptions have seeped into our products. Whether they're a military product or their foundry or ontology or AIP, they also, by the way, for those listening who think our strategy is crazy, many of your best people are applying to Palantir now. So while we may be crazy, we are being bombarded by people who want to work with this company, bombarded.\nI cannot -- a day does not go by where I'm not getting a call, an e-mail, 50 attempts to get into our company. We are razor, we are white hot in recruiting. We're a 20-year company with the strongest recruiting I've ever seen from a company that's historically had the strongest recruiting and the most competitive environment in the world, Silicon Valley, that is because we stand behind our values and because we intend to win with those values, which we're approving. So this was an extraordinary extraordinary last year. We also took care of making sure we're aligned internally on comp. We are streamlining our events the way we go to market. And I would also say from the perspective as the leader of our movement, nominally called the CEO of our company. We have never been this aligned internally. We are a company that engages the most talented, interesting and difficult people in the world. Some of them are at this table. And there has never been a time where we have been this motivated, this in unison and this proud of our company and our accomplishments. And so I'm proud to be proud with them, and it's -- we are going to keep on our efforts, and I foresee a very, very strong year, especially in U.S. commercial. I would also say the strength of our U.S. commercial and the strength of our products being used in the most difficult and most important war zones in the world is going to have a handoff function into USG. And I'm optimistic that handoff function will happen, and we will be as successful there as we are in U.S. comp.",

I'm Ana Soro from Palantir finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued before the market opened and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward looking in applicable in a tetrameric statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results. management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed before the market opened today, and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.\nOver the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Sean Singer, Chief Technology Officer; David Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe are pleased to report that our company achieved GAAP profitability for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we continue to drive strong results across our company. In Q3, we closed 80 deals of $1 million or more across 30 industries, 29 deals of $5 million or more across 16 industries, and 12 deals of $10 million or more across 11 industries. Our U.S. commercial business accelerated last quarter, growing 33% year-over-year. Excluding strategic commercial contracts, it grew 52% year-over-year and 19% sequentially, and 3/4 of our quarter-over-quarter growth is from customers that started with us in 2023.\nOur U.S. commercial customer count rose 12% quarter-over-quarter and is now tenfold what it was just 3 years ago. Deal count for our U.S. commercial business is 2.4x what it was in Q3 of last year and U.S. commercial TCV closed at $252 million, up 55% year-over-year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. We're also seeing the acceleration of larger deals and shorter times to conversion and expansion, including a multiyear deal in excess of $40 million with 1 of the largest home construction companies in the U.S. to start up pilot and converted all within Q3. This growth is in part due to AIP's continued transformation of the way we partner with and deliver value for our customers, and we expect AIP's impact to continue to intensify. The rapid expansion of AIP at both our existing and new customers, and the impact it is having on their operations is nothing short of remarkable.\nIn the last quarter, we reoriented our go-to-market approach around AIP boot camps, which has allowed us to deliver real workflows on actual customer data in 5 days or less versus our traditional pilots, which generally take 1 to 3 months. We're seeing different stakeholders at the table, including tangible engagement from IT, a quicker time to value for customers, a wider range of organizations partnering with us and the ability to have multi-organization boot camps. Early indications point to vast improvements on our unit economics from initial contact to customer conversion, all while accelerating new customer negotiations. Boot camps are also driving contract expansions. We're on track to conduct boot camps for more than 140 organizations by the end of November, nearly half of those are taking place this month alone, which is more than the number of U.S. commercial pilots we conducted all of last year.\nIn these boot camps, our customers attack problems that have immediate impact and learn how to deploy AI into their unique operating environment in a matter of days. Our customers' results speak for themselves. One attendee said that we achieved more in 1 day for them with AIP than 1 of the top 3 hyperscalers had accomplished over the last 4 months, and then presented their work with Palantir instead of the hyperscaler to the CEO the very next day. Another attendee said, we basically built 10x faster with 3x less resources, and yet another claimed, we have built in a day what they wouldn't be able to get internally in months, and then it probably still wouldn't meet the requirements.\nAIP is being used for a multitude of workflows at customers across the globe. Just a few examples include the following: our partners in the health care space, including Tampa General, HCA and Cleveland Clinic, are using AIP for dynamic scheduling, turning software from a place of data entry into a provider of operating leverage. Aramark is using AI to procure more efficiently, generating custom proactive negotiating strategies. Panasonic North America is using AIP to scale its workforce and accelerate how quickly new engineers can level up. Eaton is using AIP to more efficiently deploy fixes by identifying available materials across different plants or assembly patterns. Carrefour Brazil is increasing the fill rate of online grocery orders with higher accuracy. The energy and engagement around AIP is unlike anything we've ever seen.\nThe potential market for AIP and the trajectory of possible AIP growth for our business is massive. We almost tripled the number of AIP users last quarter and nearly 300 distinct organizations have used AIP since our launch just 5 months ago. We will continue investing meaningfully in boot camps as our go-to-market strategy for AIP.\nThrough all of this, we never forget that we are a company built on a foundation of counterterrorism. In response to recent world events, we continue to be dedicated to our founding principles of supporting the most important missions in the world, including providing intelligence and defense capabilities to global allies. In that vein, our impact has never been more compelling. We have the products now that the world needs. We expect our U.S. government business to reaccelerate beyond the current growth rate of 10% year-over-year, given increasing demand for those products to support our allies around the world. While we continue to expect near-term uncertainty given budgetary environments, we were encouraged by the pickup in activity at the end of the U.S. government fiscal year, and we feel well positioned for long-term growth through our evolving strategy, which Sean will speak to further. Just several weeks ago, it was announced that the Army awarded us a new contract worth up to $250 million over 3 years to provide additional capabilities in support of [indiscernible], armed services, intelligence community and special forces as they continue to test, utilize and scale AI and ML capabilities.\nAs we enter the final months of the year, we are steadfast in our focus on AI and unlocking the impact it can have for our customers. We look forward to continued business momentum through year-end and are excited for the opportunities to continue delivering unmatched impact for our customers into the new year.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. At AIPCom 2, this past September, I unpack some of the foundational engineering challenges that we've solved to deploy LLM that are anchored in your data on your private network and to safely orchestrate your enterprise with tools, actions and other AI models. The core concept of the KLLM kernel enables you to reliably harness LLMs for critical workflows to manage the risks in the underlying models changing out from underneath you and to create the shortest and safest path to put your own fine-tuned models into production.\nWhy use one LLM when you can use K? The art is in synthesizing the outputs from this committee of experts to create a rich topology of answers to the prompt. LLMs are statistics, not calculus. It's more like predicting the weather than predicting an eclipse. And that's why we're focused on proof, not proofs of concept. AIP gives our customers the infrastructure they actually need to ship production use cases quickly. This difference has been so profound that we shifted the entire commercial organization to focus on 1- to 5-day long customer boot camps, where organizations exit with a scalable use case on their actual data that they built for themselves. Customers leave so excited with this definite optimistic view of what can be accomplished, and how they'll drive transformation in their organizations.\nAnd these boot camps have created enormous tailwinds with IT attendees for 2 reasons. First, we're defining the most advanced and valuable reference architecture for GenAI in the enterprise. And second, with the release of virtual tables and foundry, IT's primary objection of data duplication is eliminated. We're running more boot camps per month than we had U.S. commercial pilots all last year. These boot camps really allow the customer to experience 3 magic moments for themselves. First, that you really can't use LLMs without tools. That elegant integration of algorithmic reasoning to unlock the full potential. Second, that the object, in other words, the rich representation of your enterprise and its state and not chat is the prompt, or said differently, the Boot Camp experience enables them to transcend chat.\nAnd finally, the power of live integration of expert feedback through the AIP infrastructure to efficiently generate adaptive models. At the end of the boot camp, customers say things like, once you see it, you can't unsee it. As Ryan mentioned, it's common to hear attendees express that they could do in days what they couldn't previously with other AI technologies and months.\nIn September, we also Palantir Government Web Services to expand Palantir's mission by supporting and growing today's nascent but inspiring defense tech ecosystem. Through Palantir GWS, we're providing emerging and existing companies in the defense industrial base with the enabling software to quickly operationalize their mission-critical capabilities at scale, all aimed at minimizing the value of death and bringing the best of America's greatest advantage software to the fight.\nFedStarts and Apollo are the first offerings in GWS. FedStarts platform accreditation as a service offering radically compresses the time line and cost of unlocking IL-5 markets and beyond. Apollo's autonomous software delivery platform is the most technically mature and sophisticated approach to continuously delivering complex modern software to the thousands of edge environments required to deter and defeat threats in the Pacific. Fedstart customers like Calypso AI and [indiscernible] and Apollo customers like Lockheed shared their acceleration journeys at our software for government conference hosted in our DC offices in September.\nThe reaction to Palantir GWS has been amazing. VCs, defense tech entrepreneurs and government PMs are responding to the investments in a big tent ecosystem and the efficiency and scale that we're providing. We also launched our mixed reality service and immersive C2, an application that was built on the mixed reality service at the Army's AUSA Conference in October. It was met with rave reviews. Our immersive C2 application showed how command and control could be done on the move in the back of a vehicle, leveraging mixed-reality headsets built on GWS infrastructure. And our mixed reality service will mean that any application that builds on or integrates with GWS can instantly enable their own mixed reality offering.\nFinally, our products could not be playing a more central role for real-world events. It's incredibly rewarding to see the products that we've built over the last 20 years meet their moments, often in new and impactful ways. From MetaConstellation, which is enabling tactical overhead imagery in the field, to guide for mission planning, to even foundry for complex video imagery and audio analysis and automation. From the mission data platform and its real-time cross-domain collaboration across allied nations to MAVERICK for target effect repairing and advanced fires execution. These real-world events validate the investments that we have made over the last 5 years, and strengthens our conviction in what we are building now for the future. And with that,\nI'll hand it over to Dave to talk us through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. We had an exceptional quarter. Revenue growth reaccelerated on the back of our U.S. commercial business, driven by our intense focus on AIP, while margins continue to expand, demonstrating the transforming unit economics of our business. We beat the high end of our guidance range on both top line and bottom line and increased our Rule of 40 score [ 800 ] basis points quarter-over-quarter to 46 while simultaneously delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, the first time ever that we are GAAP profitable on a trailing 12-month basis.\nWe also delivered our third consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit and over $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the last 4 quarters.\nTurning to our global top line results. Third quarter revenue reaccelerated to $558 million, up 17% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, exceeding the high end of the range of our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Trailing 12-month revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 13% year-over-year to $54 million per customer. Customer count grew 34% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 453 customers as we remain focused on landing new accounts.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. Third quarter commercial revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $251 million. I'd like to congratulate the entire commercial org for reaching a $1 billion annualized run rate milestone this quarter. It's quite an achievement. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue grew 34% year-over-year and 11% sequentially.\nIn the third quarter, U.S. commercial revenue reaccelerated to $116 million, up 33% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. We continue to see the impact of our intense focus on AIP on our commercial business, both through the adoption of new customers and the expansion of opportunities at existing customers. We booked $252 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing growth of 55% year-over-year on a dollar-weighted duration basis.\nOur U.S. commercial customer count grew to 181 customers, reflecting 37% growth year-over-year and 12% sequentially, benefiting from the increase in velocity of our AIP go-to-market motion. This represents a tenfold increase in U.S. commercial customer count from when we went public just 3 years ago.\nOur international commercial business was up 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $134 million as we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond, while conditions remain challenging in Continental Europe. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $15 million or 2.6% of quarterly revenue, down from $19 million in the prior quarter. We anticipate fourth quarter revenue from these customers to continue to decline to between $13 million to $15 million, representing 2.3% of expected fourth quarter revenue.\nShifting to our Government segment. Third quarter government revenue grew 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $308 million. U.S. government revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $229 million. While it's hard to predict exactly when our government revenue will reconverge at historically high CAGRs, as Shyam mentioned, our products, PG, GAIA, MetaConstellation and AIP are needed in battlefields across the world and even more so in the current geopolitical landscape. International government revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $78 million, bolstered by our continued work in health care and defense.\nMoving to bookings. TCV booked was $830 million, up 29% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 107%, impacted primarily by headwinds from our commercial business in Continental Europe. Net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that we acquired in the past 12 months and is, therefore, not reflective of the recent acceleration in our U.S. commercial business.\nWe ended the third quarter with $3.7 billion in total remaining [indiscernible] value and $988 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nOur U.S. commercial business saw total remaining deal value growth of 23% year-over-year and 27% sequentially when excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts highlighting the acceleration of our go-to-market motion.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 82% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $163 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 29%, 400 basis points ahead of the high end of our prior guidance, and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins.\nQ3 adjusted expense was $395 million, down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. In short, we've been able to flatline expenses for 4 consecutive quarters while investing significantly in our products, including AIP and reaccelerating our revenue. This drives home the efficiency and operating leverage of our software at scale.\nR&D adjusted expense was up 9% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, demonstrating our commitment to continuously drive forward product innovation and invest in technical talent.\nOver the past year, we have emphasized our unwavering dedication to sustain GAAP profitability and GAAP operating income. Our 4 consecutive quarters of improving GAAP operating income enable us to more aggressively invest in AIP. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth, even as we increase investment and resourcing to AIP and in specific geographies around the world.\nIn the third quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $40 million, our third consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income. We also generated GAAP net income of $72 million, representing a 13% margin, our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. This is the first time we've ever achieved both GAAP net income and GAAP operating profitability on a trailing 12-month basis.\nWhile we continue to manage our stock-based compensation expense, as I mentioned in previous quarters, we expect it to trend up in Q4 as we continue to invest in AIP. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.03. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 46%, an 800-basis-point increase to a Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. We will strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance.\nTurning to our cash flow. In the third quarter, we generated $141 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 25%, and $133 million in cash from operations, representing a margin of 24%. Over the past 4 quarters, we've generated $490 million in cash flow from operations and $502 million in adjusted free cash flow, marking the first time we've exceeded $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We ended Q3 with $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury bills.\nWe retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q4 2023, we expect revenue of between $599 million and $603 million, adjusted income from operations of between $184 million and $188 million and GAAP net income. For full year 2023, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.216 billion and $2.22 billion. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $607 million and $611 million. And we continue to expect GAAP net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome. I don't think the camera is working. Welcome to our earnings. Obviously, current events and the performance of our business are an absolute validation of our strategy of building the world's most aligned and powerful enterprise products years, sometimes decades before they're needed before you could imagine their power. AIP and U.S. commercial, not only is disrupting the market, it's setting a standard that I don't believe any other software company will be able to reach partly because they misunderstood the value of LLMs and their relative importance and lack of importance, partly because they don't have decades of experience on the frontline as we do in the military with managing the core ways in which you make these things precise, the way in which you provide governance.\nAlso because the playbook backed by venture capitalists and supported by analysts has always been make the thinnest technology possible that is misaligned with your enterprise and hire the most and best salespeople so the enterprise gets moderate value while having its high revenue exported in a parasitic manner the cheers of insiders and the pain of retail investors. And we obviously rejected that.\nAnd then on the mission side, we have been saying and building products for a world that is violent, disjointed, irrational, a world in which you have to show strength, a world in which, if you do not show strength, people who are biased, xenophobic, daresay [indiscernible], will rear their head. A world in which you really have to pick sides. Palantir is the first major company to in my view to have said from the beginning, I think that is obviously true. There is no such thing anymore of being on all sides. Palantir only supplies its products to Western allies. We've never supplied our products to enemies. We proudly support the U.S. government. I am proud that we are supporting Israel in everyway we can. And we also support plain English speaking. So when people are [indiscernible] to the equivalent of almost 50,000 people in Israel, we view it as a terror act. We call it terrorism. We supply our product to people who're fighting terrorism, and we have no problem with describing as it is or sticking up for our allies. And we don't provide false context. All of a sudden, you need a lot of context for describing what it means to kill Jews or persecute jews across the world. I believe, in context and we -- in places where you need to actually provide it.\nBut at Palantir, we have seen that our view of the world which is that there really are people that are violent and not in conformant with morality need to be fought. And we are supplying these products that we've built over the last 20 years to our allies, and we are proud of the results. And I would say -- also, even commercially, you are going to see that our alignment with our client, our alignment with our society pays major dividends. And for those of you who are along for the ride, we really celebrate you. And we are going to bring our warrior culture to our products, to our market fit and the results of which we are going to bring to our allies.",

I'm Ana Saro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2023 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations.\nThese statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Alex for opening remarks.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our earnings. We are at a unique period at Palantir. Through the course of the last 20 years, we -- what is in arguably one of the most interesting, impactful product offerings in the world, [ PG&E ], Foundry, our target selection platform, Apollo. Our goal at Palantir was to be the most impactful, important software company in the world, a company transforming Western institutions and the underlying goal there was to make the West stronger and to make Palantir the most important software company in the world.\nIn a weird way, in the last couple of months since we launched AIP since we had AIPCon, we have seen the way in which technologies we built that seem to be of moderate utility were built almost in anticipation of the AI revolution, both algorithmatic and large language models. And that convergence has remade Palantir, taking Palantir away from its terminal value being it made the world better by making our institutions in the West stronger, more productive, more efficient, in some cases, more deadly, to giving us the aspiration and realistic perspective of being the most valuable enterprise software company in the world. We see a market, especially in the U.S., which is hungry for an ability to apply AI, both large language models and algorithms to transform our businesses. I believe this transformation will change the GDP of America, and that Palantir will participate in that -- in the delta between where the GDP is now and where it will get to, powered by unique technologies that are almost exclusively being built in the United States and are being adopted more rapidly, more efficiently with more vigor.\nOf course, there are headwinds. Many of the people and companies who have no product offer and do not have the technical capabilities to build them, are trying to slow down this revolution for the obvious reason that they're not participating. And these tools are accelerating innovation so that if you're not participating in, you're literally standing still while everyone is accelerating. And there are no longer luxury products in the way people thought having world-class software was. So buying Foundry appeared to many institutions as well, of course, it's the best product, but it's -- it would require us to change how we function or change how we procure software.\nBy the way, the large language model revolution has changed Palantir's relationships institutions because we were misaligned for years and years with IT all globally. We were misaligned with the way in which we thought an enterprise should be run. But the way in which you actually can process large language models to get more exact, more precise, more operationally valuable insights, the way you can actually write them safely into your enterprise, meaning you can control your enterprise. The way you can turn them into logic that allows you to power your enterprise, both in the read-write function with governance that is mandated by law or by ethics. We provide those ways of working are exactly the ways we always thought one would have to work. But before the delta was insufficient.\nAnd then last not least, there's no road map. Palantir is the world's best at no road map, innovation products built for a world where things disintegrate and you actually need to do things in the way they would be done in the natural state. So in the natural state, you would have something like Foundry, you would have an ontology, would have AIP. Institutions in America are going back to their natural state, a state for which we've built products especially in the U.S. You see this in Palantir's numbers. So why is that? Because we built products for the natural state of how an enterprise should work. That state is apparent to people because of the enormous power, the power to accelerate time, to change your business using large language models. And therefore, it is something which people embrace.\nWe've now moved from being -- and that product our product, our culture fits both efficiently and in a way that's charismatic to especially U.S. commercial institutions and also government institutions that are realistically aware of the dangers of adversaries who are cutting and exceedingly competent especially at technology.\nSo this puts us in a remade transformed position where we can -- the aspiration of powering our most important institutions, which is clearly nowhere near done. So intelligence and defense has gotten us to the point where I think it's indisputable that Palantir's software in that space is the most important in the world. Now while continuing to focus on that, we can focus on, okay, but given that we've built these precursor technologies, given that our product has moved from being nascent to having thousands of users the AIP product, given that we believe that the reception to this is unlike anything we've seen in PG, Foundry, Apollo, target selection, and given the receptivity of the market, also not to mention that we have been profitable now, we expect to be eligible for the S&P for several quarters. We've been profitable that we have over $3 billion in the bank, that positions us to fulfill our new aspiration that allows us to see in the future how we would do that, which is to simply be the most valuable enterprise software company in the world. And we are joyous for this moment. And thank you for being with us today.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nFor the third consecutive quarter, our company achieved GAAP profitability and again maintained a GAAP operating income in Q2. This is a testament to our steadfast focus and commitment to delivering results and impact for our partners, all while innovating against the AI opportunities ahead.\nLast quarter, we hosted AIPCon which convened over 150 unique organizations as we formally launched our new AIP product offering and customers demonstrated how we're partnering with them to unlock the value of AI. For example, Jacobs Engineering highlighted how AIP is enabling them to monitor current system conditions and conduct future infrastructure planning in real time versus the months of analysis it would have taken previously. Similarly, J.D. Power's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, asserted that the advantage comes not from the AI models you can build, but rather how you apply them to the data you have and deploy it into applications. This is where true value is created for our customers and where we stand poised to help.\nThe CEO of Novartis was recently interviewed on CNBC discussing our partnership in which we created an integrated data lake that they are now leveraging to move AI forward quickly within the company, which the CEO calls Novartis' \"fundamental advantage\" over its peers. We launched AIP just 10 weeks ago, and already we're seeing unprecedented inbound interest. AIP is also opening expansion conversations with our largest, longest tenured customers as the new capabilities are causing them to reimagine how they can use our software. Looking at both existing and new customers, AIP is the solution for organizations who want to wheel the LLM securely in their enterprise. We remain focused on aggressively capitalizing on this momentum by driving compounding growth of AIP usage. As this fast-moving market evolves and expands, so too will we. And it's just the beginning. This increasing demand will be incremental to the results you see today.\nOur U.S. commercial business continues to deliver outsized results. With our rapidly growing customer count, we are seeing the beginning of the network effects in the segment, whether in events like AIPCon, through direct customer referrals to their network or by leaders working with us in 1 organization, taking us with them to their next one. We expect the expansion effect to be multiplicative.\nAt the same time, we're seeing success across many different industries. In Q2, we closed deals in U.S. commercial in roughly 30 different industries, including across pharmaceuticals, energy, consumer staples, utilities, health care, construction, automotive, transportation infrastructure, the list goes on and spans industries and institutions at the core of today's society. While we see the breadth of our software spanning industries, we still have immense opportunity for growth, both through expansion within these industries and growth in our existing customer relationships.\nFor example, we're beginning to see this growth come to fruition in both health care and transportation, which grew 93% and 129% year-over-year, respectively. Foundry is being used at numerous health care facilities to generate their schedules and forecast patient placements, among other applications. For example, with Foundry, HCA now generates nurse schedules in 1 hour each month instead of 10 to 20. Tampa General has seen a 28% reduction in patient hold times and has reduced the time spent managing patient placements by 83% and Cleveland Clinic has been able to accept an 8.5% increase in patient transfers from other hospitals in just 4 months since launch.\nWhile we continue to increase our breadth and expansion across industries, we also continue to grow at our existing customers. We had over 2 dozen U.S. commercial customers that brought in more than $1 million in revenue each during last quarter alone. And we're seeing outsized growth from our newest customers. 54% of the U.S. commercial revenue, excluding strategic commercial contracts, is from customers that have started since the beginning of 2021, with nearly all of the year-over-year growth coming from those same customers. We expect this trend to continue.\nWe are investing in pockets of momentum within our international commercial business, such as Japan, Korea, Canada and the Middle East, among other targeted opportunities across the world. For example, through our go-to-market partnership, Fujitsu has seen recent success onboarding 8 new large-cap household name Japanese customers. At the same time, we are seeing AIP lead to expansion conversations with our largest long-standing customers in Europe. All against the challenging backdrop of today's climate.\nOn the international government side, our U.K. government business was particularly strong in Q2 as a result of our work with organizations such as the NHS and U.K. Ministry of Defense, including the Royal Navy. Within our U.S. government business, while the revenue results in Q2 are disappointing, they belie the long-term strength of our business. We remain focused on converting significant deals in the pipeline and growing existing contracts through which we are core to the government mission. In Q2, we secured a multiyear contract award from the U.S. Special Operations Command worth up to $463 million, new contract awards for the [ Aaron ] Space forces of $110 million. and conversion of Army Research Lab R&D funding to longer-term work with COCOMs, starting with CENTCOM. We believe in the criticality and meaningful impact our work is having in today's world events and its eventual monetization as well as the exceptional user impact we deliver. At the same time, our U.S. government business can be lumpy, and we continue to expect there to be near-term uncertainty around timing of contract awards.\nTurning back to the overall business, we are excited about our vast opportunities in the quarters ahead. We're already seeing that AIP will be transformational for our customers and for our business. We look forward to continuing innovating at the forefront through this revolution.\nLastly, on the back of our inaugural AIPCon in Q2, we're excited to share that we're hosting 2 additional events, the next AIPCon on September 14 and a new event, the software for government [ SFG ] Summit on September 21, and which is specifically designed for our government customers. We look forward to sharing a recap of the events with you at future calls. I'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. At AIPCon this past June, we introduced Palantir's AI platform, a core set of technologies designed to bring LLMs to your enterprise to supercharge and accelerate your experiences. From integrating data and hydrating our oncology to building AI-enabled applications and human agent teams with copilots. AIP enables you to deploy LLMs anchored in your data on your private network and to safely orchestrate your enterprise with tools, actions and other AI models. All of this in a controlled, governed and trusted AI operating system.\nThe accelerating pace of AI developments continues to be all inspiring. The key to capturing value is a fundamental recognition that we are dealing with something new and different that demand solving new integration and engineering challenges. It is, in many ways, easier to define an LLM by what it is not. It is not algorithmic reasoning. It is not human thought. Algorithmic reasoning operates as a process so well specified that there is no ambiguity in its execution like traditional code. Human thought is inherently creative and its previously most defining form natural language, is inextrictably [ rot ] with ambiguity.\nLarge language models occupy a middle ground between algorithmic reasoning and human thought. They are fluent in natural language, yet they don't really understand what they say. They are not good at executing algorithms yet, they can be instructed in ordinary pros. They are something else, non-algorithmic compute.\nLLMS are statistics, not calculus. And the introduction of even on stochastic variable into a deterministic system makes the entire system now stochastic at AIPCon 2 in September. I'm going to unpack some of the foundational engineering challenges that we've solved to manage and harness the stochasticity of these models and to enable the acceleration in our products. We are focused on driving compounding usage across industries, the problems that matter haven't changed. AIP and LLM radically accelerate the solutions. We are building on nearly 20 years of our products and experience solving these problems across more than 50 industries and every function in the value chain, only now doing it substantially faster. To name a few, a nurse shift handoff copilot for HCA, our pharmacokinetics translation assistant for Novartis, an inventory balancer copilot or a plant-based protein company, a supply chain copilot for a major beverage company. Our warranty claims copilot for U.S. auto manufacturer has made analysts twice as productive, saving them 3 to 4 hours a day.\nAs J.D. Power's CTO Bernardo said at AIPCon, the beauty of having Foundry and AIP is that you can build this really, really quickly. So we built this in a matter of days and iterate in a couple of weeks. To get the precision of calculus in the power of statistics, LLMs need to be paired with algorithmic and software tools. For example, models of forward inventory or an action registry to execute enterprise functions, a rich semantic layer to define the proper grounding and crucial [ remedies ] like scenarios that allow LLM to stage changes on branches. AIP is not only the best tool bench in this context. It is a tool factory that enables enterprises to quickly forge new bespoke tools in hours.\nLLMs can't, for example, calculate profitability or expected lead times but they don't have to. They need to have access to the software tools that can. This is why AIP is positioned to deliver outcomes so quickly. It elegantly integrates LLMs into the calculus of your enterprise to accelerate the workflows that matter. Every week, we are releasing more features and expanding the AIP productivity suite of applications, which provide Wiziwig, what you say is what you get experiences. AIP builder allows you to build your data pipelines with natural semantics. AIP terminal is the command line for your AI operating system, enabling you to dynamically wheel your ontology tools and applications for ad hoc exploration and problem solving. AIP Logic enables you to build LLM backed functions with rich tool composition in its developer tool chain. And AIP automate, lets you turn those logic functions into agents, copilots and automations.\nOne more item in this suite I want to highlight, AIP assist which accelerates all of today's uses and users of AIP Gotham and Foundry by providing help and helpers dynamically. AIP Assist is configured to be tool aware. So it knows not only everything from the product documentation, it also knows what actions it can take to manipulate the application state to actually resolve and advance the user's workflow. This supercharges our users. And as a technology, it should be available for any software to incorporate to supercharge their users. In the second half of this year, we anticipate accepting beta customers who want to use AIP Assist as a service offering in their own software.\nTurning to Gotham, the latest investments in Gotham performed excellently at CENTCOM's digital Falcon Oasis and other exercise across combatant commands, including Global Information Dominance experiment Series 6. We continue to invest in capabilities, delivering the next level of deterrents through the AI-enabled kill chain, inclusive of an integrated coalition deterrent. There's a lot more to say here, but I'd rather hide our strength and bide our time against the adversaries.\nWe continue to be very excited about Apollo. It continues to be a massive lever for Palantir internally as well as a big market opportunity. Over the last few years, Apollo has allowed us to scale up internally for managing 15 high-side stacks to 82 without scaling our team. In the market, as more defense startups are born with the surge of VC investment in the space, we believe Apollo stands as the fastest and cheapest path to delivering new capabilities to regulated and a credit environments. And in Q2, we started seeing demand from the government itself as a customer. USG customers want to move existing services they manage into Fed start to reduce their own operating risk and compliance burden.\nIn closing, we just wrapped up our annual Hack Week. Right after this call, I'll be binge watching all the submissions from the teams internally. I'm very much looking forward to further acceleration of our road maps from compelling new ideas. I'll turn it over to Dave to walk through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. The second quarter of 2023 was exceptionally strong. We're proud to report our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability and second consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profitability, generating $28 million of net income and $10 million of operating income. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins, highlighting the operating leverage in our business. We surpassed the high end of our guidance for both revenue and adjusted income from operations yet again. We also achieved a significant revenue milestone, surpassing $2 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, and we reaffirm our expectation of GAAP profitability in each quarter of this year which would make us eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 following our Q3 results.\nTurning to our global top line results. We generated $533 million in revenue, up 13% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, exceeding the high end of the range of our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, total revenue grew 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Trailing 12-month revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 15% year-over-year to $53 million per customer. Customer account grew 38% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 421 customers, demonstrating the momentum in our ability to onboard and convert new customers.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. Second quarter commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially to $232 million, a challenging sequential compare as anticipated due to the $14 million decline in revenue from strategic commercial contracts. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue grew 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. U.S. commercial revenue in the second quarter grew 20% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially to $203 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 37% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, a result that is even more impressive when compounded with the 24% sequential growth we saw last quarter. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. This highlights the velocity we are seeing in our U.S. commercial business, where we're driving significant new customer wins and expansions. Our international commercial business grew 4% year-over-year to $229 million and remained flat sequentially. Relative to the U.S., we continue to see more immediate growth with European commercial enterprises, although there remain targeted opportunities of growth internationally.\nRevenue from strategic commercial contracts was $19 million compared to $33 million in the prior quarter. We expect third quarter revenue to decline to between $14 million to $16 million, and we anticipate fourth quarter revenue from these customers to continue to trend down. For the full year, we expect revenue from these customers to be approximately 3% of total full year revenue.\nTurning to our Government segment. Government revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $302 million. U.S. government revenue grew 10% year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially to $225 million. While we acknowledge that there are uncertainties associated with the timing of contract expansions and renewals, we maintain a strong pipeline of opportunities and remain confident in the growth of our U.S. government business, particularly as USG TCV bookings grew 111% sequentially. International government revenue grew 31% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to $76 million. The reacceleration in our international government business was driven by our U.K. government work. While our government business generally sees fluctuations due to the nature of funding and contract cycles, we remain confident that our work with the U.K. government will continue to expand over the long term.\nTurning to bookings. TCV booked was $642 million, up 62% sequentially. Billings was $603 million, up 52% year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with $3.4 billion in total remaining deal value and $968 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO's primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 81% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $135 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 25% and 200 basis points ahead of the high end of our prior guidance and marking the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. These results demonstrate our ability to drive revenue growth while efficiently managing costs with second quarter adjusted expense of $398 million, up only 9% year-over-year and down sequentially. We continue to manage expense growth primarily by driving leverage in G&A, capitalizing on cloud efficiencies and calibrating our headcount investments in key strategic areas of growth. Consistent with prior years, we expect to see an increase in expenses in the third quarter as we onboard our new grad cohort of world-class technical talent.\nAs we have stated over the past few quarters, we are fiercely committed to sustained GAAP profitability. On the back of 3 consecutive quarters of GAAP net income and expanding operating margins, we are increasing investments and resources dedicated to our new product, AIP, while at the same time, increasing our full year adjusted income from operations guidance to an excess of $576 million, an increase of $45 million above the midpoint of our prior range.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth, even as we increase investment and resourcing to AIP and invest in specific geographies around the world. We generated income from operations of $10 million, our second consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income. We continue to manage our stock-based compensation. As mentioned last quarter, we expect it to trend up through the back half of the year. However, we remain laser-focused on GAAP net income and operating profitability. As we think about equity compensation and aligning it to shareholder value, we are in the process of linking future employee equity compensation to the success of AIP.\nTurning to net income. GAAP net income was $28 million, our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.01. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin was 38%. We expect to return to executing in access of the Rule of 40 for the second half of the year.\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated $96 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 18% and $90 million in cash from operations, representing a margin of 17%. Through the first half of the year, we generated $285 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 27%. We ended the second quarter with $3.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury bills. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q3 2023, we expect revenue of between $553 million and $557 million, adjusted income from operations of between $135 million and $139 million and GAAP income. For full year 2023, we are raising our revenue guidance to an excess of $2.212 billion. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to an excess of $576 million, and we continue to expect GAAP net income in each quarter.\nOn the back of our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, $285 million in adjusted free cash flow in the first half of the year and over $3.1 billion on our balance sheet, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion. This program reflects our conviction in the trajectory of our business and the value we see in our stock. With that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A.",

I'm Ana Saro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call.\nWe'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2023 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results.\nInformation concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today.\nOur press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer.\nI'll now turn it over to Alex for opening remarks.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nOn any normal earnings call, where we have just been profitable and where we're going to be profitable for the next couple of quarters, which opens up the possibility to be on the S&P, where the U.S. market grew by 28% and where we made $187 million in free cash flow, that would be the thing that was the most exciting. But in fact, what's most exciting about Palantir is we have our ability to launch products that are literally the only products on the market and that will, in fact, change your life and will determine who succeeds and who fails across enterprise, both government and commercial.\nThe large language model revolution is one that will raise ships and sink ships. Of course, the profitability is important. Of course, the fact that we make free cash flow is important, but it's not nearly as exciting as our ability to invest our resources and our founder-led energy in using our things we have built to supply enterprises with, and otherwise not available and in crazy high-demand, product.\nThis is just one of the most exciting times to be at Palantir because you have the resources of a large profitable enterprise company. So there is an issue with nonprofitable tech if you're powering the most important enterprises in the world. They want to know, can you provide the resources, the product we need tomorrow purely on a financial basis.\nBut more importantly, to us and to them long term is, can you help us disrupt our adversaries? Can you just help us disrupt our competitors? And for me, personally, can you have a product that will help the West win, especially our government, but also our commercial clients, so that we, in fact, are stronger than our adversaries.\nAnd in the last 20 years, there's never been a development like this. You have a technology that will allow you to outproduce, change the margin of your company, understand your business, react on the battlefield quicker, predict things on the battlefield in a way, collapse your enterprise so that the top and the bottom actually work together, preempt attacks, create software that is so obviously dominant that adversaries quiver and scurry away instead of attacking us or our allies.\nAnd there's 1 company in the world that is positioned. The issue of how do you have security, a data model or knowledge and wisdom that's proprietary, interact with an external large language model or with generative AI is not new to Palantir, and that's why we're able to launch our platform AIP so quickly, the demand for of which is nothing I've ever seen in 20 years of being involved in Palantir.\nAnd the reason the demand is high is people suspect that this will -- if you wheel these technologies correctly, safely and securely, meaning extract the value in the context of your own enterprise, whether that's sensitive or nonsensitive or regulated or moderately regulated, you have a weapon that will allow you to win, that will scare your competitors and your adversaries. And we are in a unique position to supply that platform, and we have the resources, both because of our profitability, our $2.9 billion in the bank, our lack of debt and quite frankly, our entrepreneurial founder-led spirit at this company. Welcome to our earnings day.\nThank you.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nAs Alex highlighted, our company once again achieved GAAP profitability last quarter, including GAAP operating income for the first time. This marks another milestone in our company's sustained growth, ensuring that we will continue delivering results and impact for our partners for years to come, while also investing deeply in the transformational AI opportunities before us. We have been taking steps across the company in recent months to refocus our efforts and optimize on the parts of our business that will drive even further growth alongside sustained profitability. .\nIn Q1 2023, we generated $525 million in revenue. Due to the seasonality of our business, Q1 tends to be our slowest quarter. But despite that headwind and the difficult macroeconomic environment that the technology industry continues to face, our commercial business generated $236 million of revenue last quarter and achieved $176 million in TCV, a 70% year-over-year TCV increase. These strong results were driven primarily by the reacceleration of our U.S. commercial business, which surpassed the $100 million revenue threshold for the first time, with 26% year-over-year growth.\nWe continue to see robust pilot starts and promising conversions and we're also beginning to see the realization of our expansion strategy, meaning we're beginning to see meaningful growth and upsell opportunities with our newer customer base. Some notable examples include the expansion of our work with Hertz, who is using foundry to more efficiently manage and operate its fleet of nearly 500,000 vehicles; and Jacobs Engineering, who is doubling down on our partnership to reduce and improve performance across plants.\nWe also signed significant expansion agreements with the largest health system in the country for continued acceleration of our hospital operations efforts and with one of the world's largest paper and packaging companies. Our U.S. commercial customer base, which stood at 155 at the end of Q1 2023, a sevenfold increase in customer count over just 2 years, presents an immense opportunity for continued expansion.\nWhile aspects of our international commercial business have been challenging in today's climate, we continue to focus on delivering transformational results to long-term customers. For example, BP, our customer of over a decade, recently shared that foundry helped them reduce production costs by approximately 60%, from $14 a barrel to less than $6 a barrel. We're also investing for growth in targeted industries and geographies, such as Korea, where I recently met with customers and saw our momentum there firsthand. This includes several strong pilot starts and the expansion of our work with Korea shipbuilding and offshore engineering focused on using foundry to enhance safety and operational efficiency.\nOur government business generated $289 million in revenue, driven in large part by our U.S. government business, which grew 22% year-over-year. With strong conviction in our work on the ground and the critical missions we're delivering against, we continue to focus on building our U.S. government business for the long term while acknowledging timing uncertainty in the short term.\nWe're investing in delivering digital deterrence and AI-driven efforts around the world from the Middle Eastern Pacific and European theaters. And with pressing global events, we continue to lean into our support for the U.S. and its allies across Eastern Europe.\nMore broadly, as we look at opportunities across our company, we are strongly investing in AI efforts, with a focus on delivering the foundational systems and software architecture that will enable enterprises to leverage the power of the latest large language models and other machine learning technologies. We're already seeing unprecedented demand for AIP, and we are reorganizing our efforts aggressively to capitalize on the interest. We anticipate that these technologies will be transformational, both for ourselves and for our customers, and we are positioned to meet the moment.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP\n\nThanks, Ryan. This past February, overlapping with our last earnings call, I had the opportunity to visit Ukraine and witness the incredible speed with which the Ukrainian forces were able to employ AI on the battlefield. It was clear that the future has already arrived, and that future requires us broadly to rewrite road maps. It changes everything to some degree and some things completely. We can either choose to join the disruptors driving this change or we can be disruptive.\nFrom diffusion to large language models, the accelerating pace of AI development is awe-inspiring and exhilarating. But there are many challenges customers will encounter as they attempt to leverage this technology operationally at any scale, from managing the mismatch between the ever-growing big data scale of the enterprise and the bottlenecks and choke points of smaller context windows of LLMs, to product design challenges of constructively embedding these models and workflows and safety and trust challenges in governing the AI in an operational and decision-making context.\nWe are well ahead of the curve because we've built the frameworks, the infrastructure and the software needed. We have already had to solve so many of the hard problems, including the development of deep expertise with the necessary intermediary scale data challenges required to effectively spin the gap from big data to small LLM context windows. And there will be many surprises and who ultimately comes up as the winners and losers of all of this disruption.\nThe AI models themselves within months have gone from cutting edge to quickly being commoditized, developing GPT-2 and GPT-3 class models at this point, table stakes. Anyone can build them in a few days with a few [ haulers ]. As the memo purportedly leaked from Google titled, \"We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI\" makes clear. Things that big tech companies have considered major open areas of development have actually been solved by a handful of people in the open source community.\nWhile some of the proprietary models hold a slight quality edge, the lead is vanishing quickly. The speed of iteration on these models, biasing to a goldilocks size of power iteration pace ratio will dominate. We believe larger, enduring value is more likely to emerge from the application and workflow layer by the players who know how to navigate the challenges of data scale mismatch that LLMs present, and we are uniquely positioned to continue to be a leader here.\nAnd because that future is already here, we must act with speed and conviction. Customers must completely rethink what they are building and how they build it. We are moving fast to ensure existing customers can quickly deploy AIP beside Gotham and Foundry to transform their operations with intelligent, contextual, decision-making and sophisticated automation and coordination from the battlefield to the boardroom.\nAIP enables customers to operate not only Foundry and Gotham, but also their businesses from a greater strategic vantage point. We provide powerful interfaces to rapidly integrate your data, build your ontology, forge AI-driven applications and workflows and build agents to orchestrate and automate enterprise actions, all in an environment with guardrails, safe handoff functions and military-grade security. AIP not only knows how to speak to you, but more importantly, it knows how to speak to GAIA, MetaConstellation, every foundry service, your ontology and your enterprise.\nAt a major insurance company, we deployed a prerelease version of AIP and, in a few days, built a collaborative AI agent to automate claims processing. The Chief Data Officer told us that AIP was years ahead of anything they had seen. The pace of innovation around AI and LLMs presents a unique opportunity for leveraging our Apollo and FedStart infrastructure. There is tremendous demand for these models in FedRAMP, IL5 and IL6. Via our FedStart offering, we can bring these start-ups to U.S. government markets in weeks.\nIn Q1, we also closed our first $1 million deal for Apollo with a major tech company. Our Foundry Ontology SDK has met the market to a great reception. These SDKs make it easy for customers to build new enterprise applications and integrate ontology into their existing ones. We plan to support AIP directly from these SDKs, extending the AI application forge deep into your enterprise ecosystem.\nThe Gotham ecosystem continues to expand with enhanced capabilities across the AI-enabled kill chain. Our most recent developments include substantial new capabilities called Maverick and fires in the broader air battle management process. This capability enables efficient translation of approved targets to weapon systems\nOn a final note, we will be sharing our insights on the latest cutting-edge AI, who will be the victors and the vanquished and, of course, showing the latest across AIP and foundry as well as hearing from our customers on how our products are powering their transformations at our June 1 customer event in Palo Alto.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. The first quarter of 2023 was a record-setting quarter for us. We achieved our second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability and also achieved GAAP operating income for the first time. This accomplishment was the result of a strong top line growth, driven by the reacceleration of our U.S. commercial business, coupled with continued disciplined spend management.\nThese achievements demonstrate our commitment to driving profitable growth, and we continue to expect 2023 to be our first full year of GAAP profitability. On the back of these exceptional results and this trajectory, we now expect to be GAAP profitable in each quarter this year.\nTurning to our global top line results. We generated $525 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2023, up 18% year-over-year, $20 million ahead of the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our U.S. business generated $337 million in total revenue in the first quarter, up 23% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, demonstrating our continued momentum in the U.S.\nRevenue from our largest customers continues to expand. First quarter trailing 12-month revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 14% year-over-year to $51 million per customer. New customer acquisition also remained strong as we saw customer count grow 41% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.\nNow moving to our commercial segment. In the first quarter of 2023, commercial revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to $236 million. Our first quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 26% year-over-year and 39% sequentially to $107 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 46% year-over-year and 24% sequentially.\nIn addition to the strength of our U.S. commercial revenue growth, our U.S. commercial customer count grew 50% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Commercial revenue from our strategic commercial contracts surpassed first quarter expectations at $33 million due to the unanticipated acceleration of revenue from certain of these contracts. We expect second quarter revenue from these customers to be between $17 million and $19 million and to drop off significantly in the third and fourth quarter. Our expectations of full year revenue from these customers remains unchanged at approximately 3% of total full year revenue.\nIn the first quarter, our international commercial business grew 8% year-over-year and declined 7% sequentially. The results were impacted in part due to a tough comparison to the prior quarter as a result of the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts in the fourth quarter and the seasonal headwinds we often see in the first quarter with some of our largest international enterprise customers.\nTurning to our government segment. First quarter government revenue grew 20% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially to $289 million. First quarter U.S. government revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $230 million. While we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in our U.S. government business, we acknowledge that there are uncertainties associated with the timing of these contract expansions and renewals. Nonetheless, we remain confident in the growth of our U.S. government business.\nFirst quarter international government revenue grew 11% year-over-year and declined 13% sequentially to $59 million. The sequential decline was driven by nonrecurring revenue catch-up we saw in the fourth quarter as well as some challenges with the timing of contract awards in the first quarter.\nTurning to bookings. TCV booked in the first quarter was $397 million, up 60% year-over-year. U.S. commercial TCV grew 170% year-over-year to $124 million, again demonstrating the strength of our U.S. commercial business. We ended the first quarter with $3.4 billion in total remaining deal value and $936 million in remaining performance obligations.\nAs a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with the initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Both remaining deal value and remaining performance obligations have continued to face headwinds from the macroeconomic impact on customers from the strategic investment program. As a result, the total remaining deal value and the total value of our commercial contracts from our strategic investment program decreased by $102 million since last quarter as we continue to review and assess the financial condition of these businesses.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 81% for the quarter. First quarter adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was $125 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 24%, 600 basis points ahead of our prior guidance and marking the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. These results demonstrate our ability to drive strong revenue growth while managing costs effectively, with first quarter adjusted expense up only 1% sequentially to $400 million.\nWe continue to manage expense growth by optimizing operations and G&A, capturing cloud efficiencies and focusing our headcount investments in key strategic areas. We remain committed to sustained GAAP profitability while, at the same time, increasing investment in both the U.S. to capture the momentum we are seeing and in the development of advanced software capabilities, particularly our AI-driven offerings.\nWe believe that artificial intelligence, including large language models will prove transformational for our business and for enterprises in the government and commercial context. To that end, we are rebalancing our efforts and investments to capitalize on these developments.\nIn the first quarter, we generated income from operations of $4 million, our first ever quarter of GAAP operating income. This reflects our laser focus on profitable growth and continued management of our stock-based compensation. While we expect to see stock-based compensation expense trend up through the remainder of the year, we remain focused on GAAP net income and operating profitability.\nTurning to net income. First quarter GAAP net income was $17 million, our second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. This was the result of our strong GAAP operating income as well as interest income from our balance sheet and the narrowing of losses from investments. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.01, our second consecutive quarter of positive GAAP EPS.\nWe are extremely proud that we were able to continue to deliver GAAP profitability on a consistent basis. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin was 42% in the first quarter. We will continue to strive to achieve the Rule of 40 throughout 2023 and beyond.\nTurning to our strong cash flow in the first quarter. we generated $189 million and $187 million in adjusted free cash flow and cash from operations, respectively, each representing a margin of 36%. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury bills. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $950 million through our $500 million revolving credit facility and $450 million delayed draw term loan facility, both of which remain entirely undrawn.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q2 2023, we expect revenue of between $528 million and $532 million, adjusted income from operations of between $118 million and $122 million and GAAP net income. For full year 2023, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.185 billion and $2.235 billion. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $506 million and $556 million, and we now expect GAAP net income in each quarter of this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nI'm John Thornhill from the Financial Times, and I'm delighted, first, to be at this conference, and second, to be interviewing Dr. Alex Karp, their Founder -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Executive of Palantir Technologies.\nNow Alex, I think it's fair to say is a somewhat unusual chief executive of a very unusual company. There are not many chief executives I can think of who have a philosophy PhD and who trained under Jurgen Habermas and who have gone on to run a software company that was launched to apply data and AI to help track down terrorists after 9/11.\nOne of his friends was quoted in the FT as saying that Alex is allergic to simplicity. And you're also quoted in that piece as saying, \"The country that wins the AI battles of the future will set the international order.\" So you're in the right place today to discuss all this.\nI wondered if we could start by you telling us what role AI is playing in the war in Ukraine. And to the extent you can, what role is Palantir playing?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWell, first of all, very happy to be here. Thank you for that kind introduction forwarded to my relatives to be happy to know I'm so accomplished. That quote, just as a reference, I think, was from 3 years ago, something like that. And when we -- when I was saying this, when we got involved in what's now called AI in parts of the DoD on named parts because Silicon Valley's view of technology was please send it to the adversaries and send the carcinogens to America and the allies. If you're getting really rich, why should everyone have a good life, too?\nAnd we took a different path, which was -- and so when they abandoned the U.S. government's efforts to build AI in the war context, we had a lot of trepidation about getting involved because this was like 5, 6 years ago, and AI, as it was until a couple of years ago, was really a bumper sticker for fraudsters, half fraudsters and people selling snake oil. And when you're in software, you have to be very, very careful to not be proximate to that because it all looks like a PowerPoint.\nI could hand out unnamed companies where I know the software doesn't exist, and they would have a PowerPoint largely copied. They would figure out what we're doing and print it up, we look better. The people pitching it to you will look nicer or better in the American context, they have whiter teeth. -- in this context, they have a better swim style or something that's very appealing. And so we got involved in the -- what digitalization of warfare a number of years ago.\nAt the same time, we were already still maintaining products that we have built largely for the West, but particularly useful in Europe because you have an environment where data protection and anti-terror work has to go hand in hand. And that gave us an architecture for understanding how an enterprise would work with segmented data.\nSo -- you just have a huge -- the typically every -- now everyone is excited about AI because it's, a, not a joke, it's clearly transformative and you're seeing the results of open AI in the consumer Internet context. I would maintain that the history of technology from -- certainly in the last 100 years is things coming from the military, going to consumer. And that's also what I think primarily actually has happened in AI where -- and again, we're not -- our role in Ukraine has been widely discussed. I won't say that much about it.\nBut as a matter of theory, the old way of targeting where you don't use where algorithms aren't used is clearly a failure. And if you go into battle with old school technology, even if you're spending $65 billion a year and you're highly accomplished war fighters like Russia, and you have an adversary that you know how to install and implement digitalized targeting and AI, you obviously have a massive disadvantage. But which the world heard, and that's why there's a lot of interest in AI.\nBut what's very interesting is the way we discuss AI and public networks, consumer Internet doesn't actually translate to private networks. So if you're doing digitalization or AI on health care records or in the context of war, you have issues of welding work finding context you have well, who makes the decision under what condition who takes responsibility, who does the after action report if the AI makes a decision, who's responsible for that before were you have the ethics of war, who starts the war under what conditions during the war, what targets are taking out, what kind of targets can be taking out.\nWhat is -- every country has an idea of safe harbor, i.e., targets you can't take out, targets and need special authorization, targets that need different kinds of action, action reports. You have different kinds of segmentation inside data sources. So without going to any details in the Ukraine or other countries, you have very different data sources. They're structured in a different way. You have security issues.\nIf you're working at war as you as everyone in the room would know, you can't supply all your data sources, i.e., your asset sources, your human insignia to everyone on the war field, even by proxy through an algorithm because that can be deciphered. So how do you run algorithms and run targeting packages, where these things are paramount, so the adversary doesn't immediately know what you're doing, how you're doing it and can replicate it.\nAnd then in the civilian context, this is a heavily regulated environment, for example, in Europe. You can't just run interjurisdictional AI on data sets in health care, legal, pharmaceuticals, in any of the inter-jurisdictional, AI is, for lots of good reasons, would not be allowed legally or, in my view, ethically.\nSo how do you make the AI or digitalization work in that context? That's something we've spent the last 5 years building. And what's super interesting now is it was a joke. And when I was giving you this quote, I largely just got ridiculed by my academic friends. But like I don't think -- I think it's pretty obvious to people in this room, not as obvious maybe to people outside this room, but the ability to dominate the battlefield on our ethical terms, meaning where we can control who does what and under what circumstances, will define who writes the law and how it's interpreted.\nNow this maybe is less controversial in Europe. It is particularly controversial, I think, in academic circles within which I lingered. But I view it as a banality in effect. And certainly, the fact that AI is not an incrementally better technology like maybe mortars and tanks where 1 country has a slight advantage, it is completely arithmetic and nonlinear.\nAnd so yes, that's a lot.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nSo just to drill down in that, if I -- with my journalistic supervisors will summarize that as saying what you're saying is that when we talk about was we talk about kind of mortars and tanks, but in fact, it's data processing is now the new super how that is enabling the Ukrainians to more than match the Russians.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWell, yes, you -- it used to be that something like an analytic package plus -- yes. But -- and what I'm saying on top of it is that the differential lift by advanced augmented or digitalized or AI is so great that powers that know how to implement this build upon it can defeat powers that have been spending $6 billion a year over decades, more recent credit views power of advanced algorithms is now so great that it equates to having tactical nuclear weapons against an adversary with only conventional weapons.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nNow is that really true? We were hearing from Professor Lawrence Freeman this morning that when the war started, everyone thought that the Russian cyber offensive would overwhelm the Ukrainians, take out all of their civilian infrastructure. That has largely failed. What they're doing is this very kinetic attack on the Ukrainians.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nLook, there's so much about this war that can't be discussed in public. I don't think that's exactly how this went down. But people in the room will know more than that about that than I -- and so I don't think that is actually a fair assessment. I -- and were that true, then I would -- then you're assuming that the capacity -- first of all, there's offensive cyber and there's offensive targeting. I'm in the offensive targeting. What we build, MetaConstellation, is in the offensive targeting business. It's a different business.\nBut I would -- so what I think is we are at the very, very, very early days of AI. But in the last 6 months, we went from a world where AI was, and digitalized targeting and, in general, like ability to take out targets, you could call it a digitalized kill chain, whatever you want to call it, it was a either something for a highly erudite ethics discussion, which I find fascinating, or something that someone was pitching you to buy where the results were going to be a steak dinner.\nAnd this has now shifted to your ability to identify the right technology and implement it will determine what happens on the battlefield. And I don't think there's any dispute about that. In fact, one of the major things we need to do in the West is realize this lesson is completely understood by China and Russia. And we still spend a very small amount of our budgets on this kind of technology.\nSo if you -- obviously very in favor of the general budget staying, even growing inflation, going more inflation. But if you look at budgets in the West, what are we spending that's differentiated from our adversaries? In business, you have a venality, where you try to invest where people don't compete well against you. What we do very well in the West is figure out distributed systems that are powered by software that will allow you to fight.\nAnd this is a very specialized way of building things. This is why our software companies have done very well, quite frankly, most of them from the West Coast of the U.S. But this is why readiness that works this way. But what we need to learn is wait a minute, what are we focused on? Who is making the decisions about acquiring advanced AI digitalization and what part of the budget goes? Have they ever implemented something that works.\nBy the way, very basic things. You're going to get bombarded by various software products. Has the software ever been used in the battlefield, should be the first question. Software is not a theoretical thing. I spent the first part of my life as an academic. There are a lot of theoretically relevant questions.\nThe first question in the software context is Hugh used it, howdy used it, what are the results? You can't -- these things take 5, 6 years to build if you're very good at it, and you need access to the battlefield. Like you can't build these things in the lab.\nSo one of the advantages, quite frankly, we've had is we've been on the battlefield. Why have we had that advantage? It's one of these bug feature things because everyone in the Silicon Valley was bereft of common sense. They are busy exporting things to adversaries and corroding our system with carcinogens in the context of the consumer Internet, so we got access to the battlefield.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nSo how -- for the people in the room who are actually trying to buy this software, how do they know what software works given it's all shrouded in secrecy and no one will really know?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nAnybody in this room, I presume, who's buying software can get on the phone and talk to the people who are using the software. That's not their problem. The problem is what happens after you find out when it works. Is there -- is anyone at the top who's making these decisions, talking to the people who are proxy on the battlefield?\nIs anyone -- what portion of your budget goes to it? Probably 99% of your budget is going to very valuable things and not this kind of thing. So you need to have a wider swath -- by the way, you also need a wider swath because you're going to do new things that aren't going to work.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nOkay. This theme of this conference is responsible AI, so I'd like to get on to kind of ethics and values, which you have mentioned. I mean, I guess, to massively oversimplify in America, particularly after 9/11, there was a theory that the ends justified the means, that the national security...\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nNot our theory.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nI know, we'll come to that. In Europe, I think there's clearly an argument that individual rights, in some respects, more important than national security. So which is the bigger problem, Big Terra or [ big brother ]? Can you reconcile these two?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nIt's always interesting to tell people the things that they don't believe, probably justify we will never believe but are true. A lot of the reason why my company succeeded was, in the beginning, post 9/11, everyone was like, \"Oh, Bill, find terrorists. We don't care how.\" Most of our investors are like, \"Find terrorists. We don't care how.\"\nAnd one of -- you make lots of mistakes when you do things, and I may have made a lot of mistakes. One of the best decisions I ever made was reflecting upon Hagel. We can have a dialectic. We're going to find terrorists and protect data protection. And why is that important?\nAnd by the way, we haven't even bothered selling our product to Europe, which is -- you may not know it, but almost every European country, in some form or another, uses our CT product, counterterrorist product. And why do they use it? Because if you just find the terrorists and you abandon civil liberties, you lose half the society.\nIn my view, correctly, do you want everyone knowing what you do in your personal life? I don't. And I think it's our God-given right to have parts of our personal lives that are protected. You can't -- but if you don't find the terrorists, and this is where I disagree with a lot of my academic friends, you're going to have goose stepping in the streets.\nAnd I got yelled at all over the world for saying, our product, Palantir, has played an enormous role in Europe in stopping the far right. Not there's always conspiracy theories, not because we're in any way involved in targeting far right. But because if you protect data and stop terrorism, you get mainstream parties. If you don't protect the terrorism, you get far right people. If you own -- so you have to do both.\nNow getting to the ethics -- and what we found, by the way, is in doing both, you end up with something better because, in fact, you only need access to the data that you have access to, and you can do an incredible amount on that data. Now you get to the AI context, where it is a winner-take-all thing. And you have, again, the debate. Well, we should just throw out our ethics. Of course, our adversaries have, by Western standards, they do have ethics. They just have ethics that are very different than ours.\nAnd those ethics do not include segmenting data so that you can see how the decision-making was done, doing before and after action reports so you can decide what can be targeted, what deciding what drives the -- what areas AI can be involved in and what areas they can't be. And I would tell you the same thing that sounds academic but has made my company very successful, when you actually reach for the higher standard, you end up with a much more powerful system, and you bring everybody in the society with you.\nWhereas if you just say we're going to throw out ethics -- first of all, even if you wanted to, that is not implementable in any country in this room. It's not implementable, by the way, in America. It's like there's a slight myth that in America, it's like, we're cowboys. We were like, yes, we just -- and it is true, we're more ready for action than, say, some other countries.\nBut you do have very strong codes of ethics about what you're allowed to do, what can be targeted, what are the option. What happens if something went wrong? Who's responsible? In every Western society, you have a chain of authority that goes from civilian to military. There has to be an ability to map that chain on to digitize targeting. So it takes...\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nYou need -- and this is where you need an architecture, it takes 5, 6 years to behold, which allows you to segment the data and allows you to expose parts. First of all, AI doesn't work in private networks as well as it does in consumer for very simple technical reasons. You need to have a certain kind of tagging algorithm on the data.\nSo when you're doing that tagging algorithm, you can also create an architecture, impose an architecture that can't be changed by the user on what kinds of data sets they can have. And those data sets can be made transparent as inputs into the algorithm. And you need to have that as a separate product that works with the algorithm. And every Western society is going to have to do it.\nAnd by the way, so that's the politically kind of progressive version. Let me give you the right wing, battlefield position, I don't care about this. The reason you care about this, if you don't care about civil liberties is because that's the only way to know that you are controlling your human and Signet data, and it's not being exported to adversaries in your own organization.\nSo if you want to say, as a purely a matter of theory, your intel services want to do a special operation with your special services, you want to make sure that every bit of that data is tagged and the algorithms that are feeding into it are not exposed. You will need the same architecture that civil libertarians want, exactly the same.\nAnd one of the most interesting things about running this business for 20 years is civil libertarians don't understand that they want the same architecture that spies and special operators want for a very different reason. They want to come home alive. That's how you come home alive.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nOkay. I want to open it up to the audience very soon. I have 1 final question that I want to put in before that, which is the role of private corporations in this debate. A lot of the discussion today has been the fact that we're now, in effect, outsourcing a lot of critical national security decisions to private companies, whether it's kind of StarLink in Ukraine, whether it's the Palantir Technologies in Ukraine and elsewhere, whether it's Microsoft and what they were doing to protect Ukraine against cyber attacks and so on. So how can we ensure that private corporations are acting in the public good and what governance mechanisms are there in this area?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWell, there is a strong consensus among people in government that government should decide and we should provide infrastructure. There's just a question of, does the company actually believe that or not? So obviously, almost no company in Silicon Valley actually believes that. That's why there's all these lawsuits between the European Union and Silicon Valley. And -- but we very much deeply believe that Western institutions to decide and we should implement.\nSo the implementation infrastructure comes down to who controls what happens here. I believe that should be 100% to democratic-elected officials and the representatives in the military and other organizations. That is a controversial view in Silicon Valley. It is -- and that has to be verified. Does the company believe that or not? I 100% believe in our products are built to make sure that you -- the mandate of power is controlled by democratic, legitimately democratically elected officials and the representatives in military and intel.\nThere is another more difficult question, which is, should we build the software ourselves? I would just say, of course, there are lots of things you should build. And what you see in Ukraine are lots and lots of technical people building on products, including ours. And that's something that I also support. The idea you're going to build the whole infrastructure yourself that I think is unlikely because the cultures that build these products are where cultures of mad men and women and others. And managing that crazy group of people, it's going to be very, very hard in a government context.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nBut there are also big divisions within those companies themselves, aren't there? I mean, Google famously did not participate in Project Maven because its employees were against. Palantir, yourself, I mean, your co-founder, Peter Thiel, is a big funder of Donald Trump when he was President. You yourself...\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nYes, and I called him an ass**** in public, yes.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nI think you said I respect nothing about the dude.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThat was vulgar, but yes.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nBut -- so how -- you talked about companies as though they are a single entity, but in fact, they...\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nBut you're doing something which is very fair. You're imposing your -- our political beliefs on the decision-making. And that is a case. But at Palantir, we have a line. And we tell everybody, if you do not feel comfortable supporting the legitimate efforts of America and its allies in the context of work, don't join Palantir.\nAnd so that, by the way, we are discussing recruiting. There are a lot of people who don't want to join Palantir because of that. I respect them. but then this is the wrong company for you. And we have -- we also won't work -- we've never worked in China. We've never sent our products to Russia. There are people who are like, \"Are you working, sending your products to Russia?\" No.\nWell -- so it's just a different beast. And we do have huge political divisions around other issues inside Palantir. We are a free discourse kind of place. Lots of people -- most people at Palantir disagree with me on most issues. But -- and that's completely fine. You just -- but if you want to be a Palantir, you -- and you should know.\nBy the way, you don't have to work on the military and defense. Our U.S. commercial is the fastest-growing part of Palantir, it's growing like a weed or an oak. However -- but it's -- but you can -- but you can't then come and say, \"I didn't know.\" And I do this, by the way, for example, a German speaker, I tell -- yes, I respect the post-war German passivism, and then I've told this to right-wing people. We had people joining Palantir like, \"I just want to kill terrorists.\" Go somewhere else.\nIt's like that's not -- I really do believe in this dialectic and the people we recruit and retain internalize that so that you are both protecting data and finding terrorists. But if you're not okay with either as a matter of ideology, you just have the wrong company, and there are lots of other companies.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nYou're talking about the software. Is it a desirable or even possible to regulate lethal autonomous weapon systems?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThese things should be regulated. And you have 2 parts, the regulation and the enforcement of the regulation. Both are going to be tough. And that's why there's got to be an immediate and concerted effort to look at how that works and that should be very much part of the funding. Like one of the things that worked very, very well in Europe, we always have to sign these contracts, we can't talk up in Europe about uses our product, which is slightly annoying because we're constantly getting yelled at by people who are protected in our products.\nBut one of the things I really respect about European countries is you had to show that the product could protect data before you could get paid. And this exactly is what should happen in autonomous, semi-autonomous governance targeting perspective. You should have to show the product to work in these counterterrorism context, cellular product in the counterterrorism product context in Europe, you have to show the product works.\nAnd what does it mean that it works? That you can actually find sophisticated actors that are hidden while protecting data. Otherwise, you cannot get the contract. It's not a PowerPoint, you have to show it working. We had one unnamed country where we powered internal, external police in Europe. And by the time the tender was done, no one else competed because they didn't want to show the product working. But this is exactly what has to happen in this context.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nOkay. Questions, please, can you keep your questions [ pithy ] and don't read out your own doctoral thesis. Who has a question?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe have a bearded guy here at the front.\n\nUnknown Attendee\n\nMy name is Janet Holder from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. How do you see the AI competition between the U.S. and China play out in the next 5 years?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.",
    "content2": "There's different parts of the AI competition. People usually focus on AI in general terms and are putting 2 categories together, internal and external defense. I don't think we are going to win, nor do I want to win on internal surveillance. China owns that. And I really hope we don't try to do anything similar to that.\nYou have actually -- the closest thing you have to that is your device. We don't need more of that. We don't need to put that in the government monopoly of power. And so I assume that none of us want to go down that path, and I'm certainly not involved. I think that's the wrong path. Then you have targeting and other areas that involve finding targets, all the things we've just discussed, I think it's proven that we have an advantage.\nBut then our central disadvantage is what are we going to do with our advantage? Because right now, everyone knows we have an advantage. And we are just still operating in a world where most of our efforts are focused on hardware. I'm not against hardware development, and we should have more hardware development and some very large portion of budgets should go to hardware. But -- what needs to happen in the West now is focus, like why aren't 10% of budgets on the things we're actually better on that are winning on the battlefield? That is -- we are so far away from that.\nI would say at maximally 1%, I would be more realistic. If you said software products that are useful in the battlefield, useful as defined by our adversary, not by a PowerPoint written by a consulting company, but what does China and Russia what makes them -- what gives them trepidation? It's like 1% of global defense budgets in the West or less.\nAnd if you define it as something they're afraid of and has been used actually used, not your cousins', nephews', local product that -- it's under 10%. That has to change yesterday. And then people like in this room have to stay involved. We have a lot of customers and very different kinds of industries.\nLeaders have to sit on this. This is not the thing you can afford to outsource to the deputy you don't really like, which is like one of the reasons we do so well in tech in America in the West Coast is we make tech a business problem. Too many institutions make it the problem of the unlikable person I'm not going to talk to. If that's going to be your approach to this, your country is going to have a huge problem. Learned -- it's like -- that's not what the Ukrainians do.\nIt's like this has to be a central and personal focus of the most senior people all the way down to the bottom, backed by some -- it doesn't have to be a huge part of your budget, but it can't be 1%. It's got to be like 5%, 6% because there's got to be some room for failure. And it's like if it's 1/10 of 1%, you can only actually -- it's not going to work. And there has to be some ruthlessness.\nLook, I'm very pro sovereignty. Our product is built to support your sovereignty, that's why we have deployments all over Europe. People are waiting on top and the bottom below our product. I believe sovereignty is a crucial issue for every country in this room, especially the large countries in Europe, and I support that.\nBut like there also has to be a realistic assessment of what can I get now and what can I get tomorrow? And by the way, companies like mine are very happy to teach you how to build this stuff, but you've got to actually buy stuff that's off the shelf as well that exists now.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nRight. I can't see any other questions. So actually, there's 1 right here in the front.\n\nUnknown Attendee\n\nGood. My name is Hans Kors. I have a question on the sovereignty part where you talked about and about this technology. It looks that this technology, the company who is in front and has the real experience has a major advantage for everybody who has to -- wants to follow. And in Europe, we talk about strategic sovereignty, and we see that all the technology of this kind is coming from America. What should we do?\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThis is a very important and good question. First of all, it gets serious. Up until now, the efforts in Europe have been like -- obviously, now I mentioned names, but I met someone I very, very much respect from one of the largest company -- countries years ago, and he was like, \"Okay. Yes, it comes from America. Most of us have deep roots in Europe. Have you ever talked to any of the people there?\" Why is it so hard to come here and work? Why is it that like discourse here between people who are, like, I'm pretty Europe affiliate. I left most of my life, adult life in Europe. I wrote my PhD in German. I'm very pro-friendship in my own way. I'll leave it at that. It's like, in America, if I want a meeting with somebody, they, by and large, want to meet -- I mean, I'm not saying everybody, and I'm offensive to some people, but like, it's like pushing a closed door here. .\nAnd like also, if you want people, entrepreneurs to come here, there has to be a special program. In Singapore, I can get off a plane, and I have permanent residency. You got to have something like that in Europe. Like there has to be a serious effort to partner with people, like my company and others, where we have a cultural affiliation, where we believe in the European values, but we have different skills with local things. And we have, on our -- for our part, have to build platforms that you can build on top of, be willing to show people how to do it.\nAnd like this is much more like a learned art. And like that learned art exists in mostly on the West Coast. And by the way, it's not all of America, it's like certain parts, but there's like a performative seriousness. Now I realize it's hard in Europe because one of the things I admire about Europe is that it's radically egalitarian. Tech is not radically egalitarian. That's just a fact. And that's a very hard thing for Europe to digest.\nI like that about Europe. I view myself as a classic European progressive, meaning, I still get to say what I think, I still have a personal life, and I want poor people to have health care and teeth. Probably would be -- so that like makes me like far left in America, and I think probably right wing in Holland.\nBut it's very hard culturally because this is not an egalitarian practice. But if you want your industries to be able to compete effectively for tomorrow and provide all the egalitarian benefits that I think most people in Europe cherish and that have been a light to the world. You got to get serious about this. And serious means like what is it, who does this, who can we learn from? How can we -- who's in our local culture, very good at this?\nI think France has done some really significant efforts on this. You see efforts that are successful in Sweden. There are little offshoots. But it's -- you often have the impression when you talk to political leaders here. Yes, but I could never say that -- I could never do that in public because it would look unfair.\nTech is unfair. But if you want a fair society, you're going to need some modicum of a better software culture and Europe is so far behind. And like everyone knows us in private, but we have to somehow do better in public because like the whole European experiment, which is economic progressivism, is crucial. And something, by the way, that I very much personally support, but it will be completely called into question if everyone with a high-value revenue is sitting in America.\nAnd it's not good, by the way, for our Western alliance. Like having an alliance where America is providing all the high-value revenue, and Europe is providing the dollars, that's not an alliance that's going to be as strong as what I think we will need to do well against our adversaries.\n\nJohn Thornhill\n\nGet serious, Europe. I think we have to finish it there. But thank you very much, Dr. Karp, for a great talk.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThank you."

I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2023 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today.\nOur press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. You'll also be hearing from Shyam Sankar, our Chief Technology Officer, who prepared a few remarks, who could not join today's call as he's on the front lines with one of our customers.\nI'll now turn it over to Alex for opening remarks.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nAt Palantir, we have a tradition of talking about macro events philosophy. There would be a lot to talk about this year. I think for the first time, people have seen the impact of digitization of warfare and Palantir's central role in the world.\nLeaving aside this, and I would love to talk more about it in the context of our earnings call, in the context of our interactions with the broader world, the transformations on the outside of the world brought to you by Palantir seem to be equally big on the inside. Palantir, for the first time, is GAAP profitable.\nI, in most of my discussions, talk about product, talk about product market fit, occasionally talk about revenue. And I'm often asked, well, if it's so good, why aren't you GAAP profitable? We promised you GAAP profitability in 2025, which you thought would be in 2027 perhaps. We are now, in the last quarter, GAAP profitable, and we plan to be GAAP profitable in this year.\nObviously, there's a lot of questions around that, like how did we become GAAP profitable several years before anyone expected? What does it mean for our business? What does it mean that seemingly no tech company ever becomes GAAP profitable? Why is our company profitable? What sectors of the company made it profitable? But for those of you who have been long-term supporters or even watchers of Palantir, the move from a company that was producing the most important products in the world to a company that is doing that in a profitable context is enormous, perhaps as big as our DPO. And we're proud of this because it gives us the strength and power to continue our march to support the world's most institutions -- support institutions. Thank you.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Revenue Officer & Chief Legal Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nAs Alex highlighted, our company, after nearly 2 decades, achieved GAAP profitability for the first time last quarter. Our focus has been on building one of the most significant and durable software companies in the world. And our first profitable quarter after years of investment in our business represents the beginning of a new chapter in our company's history.\nIn Q4 2022, we generated $509 million in revenue, and we generated $79 million in cash from operations, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of positive cash from operations. While the technology industry as a whole has been facing one of the most challenging operating environments in years, we continue to deliver on our top line and bottom line results, in particular, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin.\nOur commercial business generated $215 million of revenue last quarter, while our U.S. commercial business slowed in the fourth quarter as a result of catch-up revenue in the prior quarter and contracting revenue from customers in our strategic investment program, we remain confident about our momentum and the opportunities ahead. We ended the quarter with 143 U.S. commercial customers, an increase of 79% year-over-year, and converted 13 pilots, the most in quarter-to-date setting up our U.S. commercial business to reaccelerate in 2023.\nWe are deploying increasingly focused go-to-market strategies, including in the health care, supply chain, manufacturing, energy, automotive and utility sectors. The number of deals closed in health care more than doubled in the last year. We recently signed with several of the nation's largest hospital systems, including Cleveland Clinic, Tampa General and one of the oldest teaching hospitals. Our momentum continues this year, having recently signed a deal with an American for-profit operator of over 2,400 health care sites. Together, these 4 hospital systems represent nearly 10% of the entire hospital system in the United States.\nIn the supply chain sector, we began work at 2 of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers and distributors in both the U.S. and the EMEA region. And we were called into Toyota Material Handling, a forklift manufacturer and distributor, after executives learned of our comparable supply chain work at Komatsu. Cardinal Health also recently began using Foundry to deploy AI and ML to combine diagnosis and clinical data with real-time customer purchasing and consumption data for pharmaceutical products.\nOur international commercial business grew 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, including a multimillion dollar long-term strategic partnership with Crisis24, a GardaWorld Company, to deliver data-driven security and risk management and a $50 million 5-year expansion of our work with Sompo Holdings, where Foundry is helping to improve security, health and well-being through digital transformation.\nOur government business overall saw growth across the board as well as we generated $293 million in revenue this past quarter, an increase of 23% year-over-year. Our U.S. government business saw continued growth in Q4, up 22% year-over-year, which reflects the strong contract activity in Q3. Likewise, our international government business was up 26% year-over-year, including the expansion of our work supporting pressing global events as well as the signing of Palantir's enterprise agreement with Defence Digital, a consolidated effort on the part of the British military to modernize its software systems. With the value of up to GBP 75 million, we expect this agreement to further accelerate the growth of partnerships with defense and intelligence customers across the United Kingdom as well as our U.K. government business overall.\nThis quarter's GAAP profitability illustrates our commitment to fiscal responsibility through management and margins while expanding our business. We acknowledge the challenges ahead and remain strongly poised for long-term growth.\nI'll now turn it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCTO & Executive VP, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nIn 2022, our software foiled a plot to overthrow the German government, delivered $200 million of return to Tyson Foods, empowered companies through the energy crisis. Our momentum stems from the fact that we have built software that actually works, not software that's easier to sell.\nWe publicly announced Foundry 23 at FoundryCon 2 weeks ago. The cornerstone of our product vision is that your business is computable. But just because it's computable, it doesn't mean you know how to compute it. This requires an ontology.\nOntology is link human insight with programmable controls, enabling your people to compute the parts of your business that really matter. For example, Tyson Foods implemented a model that determines the optimal allocation of inventories to trucks and distribution centers and automatically decisions that by calling back into their ERP systems, the ontology's Webhooks. This work among the 20 use cases Tysons delivers in Foundry, delivered $200 million of value for them.\nUpgrading to S4 doesn't do this. It doesn't make your business better. Your planning tools and pricing platforms don't talk to each other. ERP and MES systems don't talk to each other. So employees escape to Excel sheets, and business logic is scattered across systems. That makes your business hard to understand and harder yet to change or improve.\nOur customers need software to connect and orchestrate their existing systems. Your business is computable. You need Foundry to compute it. This view and a focus on our ontology is driving our product developments through 2023.\nTurning to Apollo. Just because you know how to compute parts of your business, it doesn't mean it's valuable. You need to complete the cycle of development, deployment and learning. Not only do you have to be able to push your logic out to the edge to the factory floor, to every connected node in your business. You need to be able to do it repeatedly. As technology companies seek to aggressively reduce cloud costs and eliminate DevOps head count, Apollo provides the critical technology enabler that solves not only the CTO's problem, but also the CFO's problem.\nWe're also continuing to see traction with [Fed Start], our Apollo-based offering, which enables customers to achieve FedRAMP authorization in record time and at a fraction of the cost while still reducing DevOps cost.\nFor Middle Eastern, the Pacific and European theaters, Gotham is today the AI-driven operating system for defense. Recent events have already proven the superiority of Gotham, and AI-driven target detection and development. In 2023, we are focused on the continued development of Gotham against both targeting and fires across all domains from space to [mud].\n[A 4 deployed O3] recently wrote a Python model using Gotham software development kit or (inaudible) in 3 hours to upgrade his units targeting and fires operation, a step change versus what was possible before. We're proud of and thankful for the privilege of supporting this mission set.\nI'll pass it to Dave to take us through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 was a milestone quarter for us. For the first time in the company's history, we've achieved GAAP profitability. This was driven by our top line and bottom line outperformance, our continued management of stock-based compensation and fiscal discipline, the narrowing of losses from marketable securities and a gain from the acquisition of our Palantir Japan joint venture. On the back of that strength, we expect full year 2023 to be our first full year of GAAP profitability several years ahead of our original goal of GAAP profitability in 2025.\nTurning to our global top line results. We generated $1.91 billion in revenue in 2022, representing a growth rate of 24% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated $509 million in revenue, up 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. We generated $1.16 billion in total U.S. revenue in 2022, representing a growth rate of 32% over the year ago period. In the fourth quarter of 2022, U.S. revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $302 million. Overall, net dollar retention was 115%.\nCustomer count grew 55% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue from our existing customers continues to expand. Fourth quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 13% year-over-year to $49 million per customer.\nNow moving on to our commercial segment. In 2022, our overall commercial revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $834 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our commercial revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Commercial revenue from strategic investment contracts was $20 million in the fourth quarter. We anticipate commercial revenue from these customers to be between $15 million to $17 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 67% year-over-year to $335 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, U.S. commercial revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $77 million but was down sequentially as we saw headwinds from catch-up revenue in the prior quarter as well as a decline of revenue from customers in our strategic investment program given the outsized impact of the macro environment on these customers. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew 79% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our international commercial business grew 11% year-over-year and 19% sequentially driven by new deals in APAC, Canada and Europe.\nTurning to our government segment. In 2022, our government business grew 19% year-over-year to $1.07 billion. And in the fourth quarter of 2022, our government business grew 23% year-over-year to $293 million. We generated $826 million in U.S. government revenue in 2022, representing a growth rate of 22% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated $225 million in U.S. government revenue, representing a growth rate of 22% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The sequential growth was driven by the commencement of certain U.S. government deals we announced last quarter.\nFourth quarter billings were $387 million. Full year billings were $1.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. TCV booked in the fourth quarter was $392 million. Full year TCV bookings was $2.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year.\nWe ended 2022 with $3.7 billion in total remaining deal value and $973 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business. Both remaining deal value and remaining performance obligations faced headwinds from the macroeconomic impact on customers from the strategic investment program. As a result, the total remaining deal value and the total value of our commercial contracts from our strategic investment program was down $262 million since last quarter as we continue to review the financial condition of these businesses. We'll continue to monitor the impact as the year progresses.\nTurning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 81% for the year and 82% for the quarter. Full year 2022 adjusted expenses, when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, were $1.5 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted expenses were $394 million, down roughly 1% sequentially, reflecting measures we took in quarter to manage discretionary spending and our focus on efficiencies.\nFull year 2022 adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was $421 million. Fourth quarter adjusted income from operations was $114 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 22%, 600 basis points ahead of our prior guidance. The significant beat on our adjusted income from operations guidance was driven by cost savings from our R&D efforts and disciplined spend management as well as moderated net head count additions in the fourth quarter.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 was our strongest GAAP operating income quarter ever as we move closer to breakeven with an operating loss of $18 million. This is a testament to our disciplined spending amid the macro uncertainty as well as the normalization of our stock-based compensation expense overhang since becoming a public company. Stock-based compensation expense was down $38 million in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago period and down $213 million compared to the year ago period.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to exercise spend discipline across the company, pace hiring while continuing to invest in high priority areas, including in our product offerings, building out our go-to-market strategy and technical roles.\nIn addition to GAAP profitability for full year 2023, we anticipate improvement in our GAAP operating income margins over the course of the year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $31 million. This was a result of a strong GAAP operating quarter in addition to $13 million of investment income from our balance sheet, narrowing of losses on marketable securities to $11 million and a $44 million gain from the acquisition of our Palantir Japan joint venture.\nBut it's not just our GAAP profitability and operating performance that I'm excited about. Our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin was 40% in the fourth quarter and 46% in full year 2022, our third consecutive full year in excess of the Rule of 40 and a score that we will continue to strive to achieve throughout 2023.\nFull year adjusted earnings per share was $0.06, and GAAP earnings per share was negative $0.18. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.04, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.01, marking our first quarter of positive GAAP EPS.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated $79 million in cash from operations, representing a margin of 15% and our eighth consecutive quarter of positive cash from operations. For the full year 2022, we generated $224 million in cash flow from operations, representing a 12% margin.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt. We retain access to additional equity up to $950 million through our $500 million revolving credit facility and $450 million delayed draw term loan facility, both of which remain entirely undrawn.\nNow turning to our outlook. For Q1 2023, we expect revenue of between $503 million and $507 million and adjusted income from operations of $91 million to $95 million. For full year 2023, we expect revenue of between $2.18 billion and $2.23 billion, adjusted income from operations of between $481 million to $531 million and GAAP net income.\nBefore opening the call up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank Jeff Buckley, our outgoing Chief Accounting Officer, for his contributions to Palantir. Jeff has been an incredible leader and a member of our team on the journey from a private company to public company. We announced a few weeks ago that he'd be stepping down after the filing of our 10-K, and we're grateful that he will be staying on with us after to help with a seamless transition. We're excited to promote Heather Planishek to the role and look forward to continuing to build on both Jeff's and the team's successes.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A.",

Welcome to Palantir's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.\nOver the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; Ryan Taylor, Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. To begin today's call, we'll open with a few highlights from FoundryCon, where you'll hear from Alex as well as representatives from Jacobs, Tyson Foods, Lilium, Apache, Swiss Re and Space Systems Command.\n(presentation)\nI'll now turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe generated $478 million in revenue this past quarter and $37 million in adjusted free cash flow, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted free cash flow. Despite significant geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, our government business surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark on a trailing 12-month basis, and our U.S. commercial business grew for the ninth quarter in a row, rising 53% year-over-year.\nThe number of customers using our software, including leading commercial and government enterprises in the U.S. and overseas, also increased substantially this past quarter, rising 66% from this time last year. We increased our U.S. commercial customer count to 132 at the end of Q3, a 124% increase year-over-year.\nOur expanded footprint within the market is a reflection of our ability to both reach additional customers and grow existing relationships. In particular, we closed 273 deals this past quarter, representing an increase of 63% year-over-year. 19 of those deals were at least $10 million in total contract value, 32 were at least $5 million and 78 were at least $1 million.\nWe have come as far as we have by consistently engaging with some of the hardest problems that the world and our customers have faced since our founding. For example, our work in supply chains which is increasingly scaling into ecosystems, is powered by Foundry's data integration capabilities. This year alone, we have started 25 supply chain projects. This includes the expansion of our work in shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy Industries, bringing the partnership to over $45 million and the expansion of our work with the FDA to modernize food supply resilience to preclude shortages like the one we experienced with infant formula earlier this year.\nThe total value of contracts that we have closed in the third quarter reached $1.3 billion, a new milestone for us, which includes nearly $1 billion of contract awards from the U.S. government alone such as our most recent contract worth up to $229 million with the U.S. Army Research Lab to deliver AI ML capabilities across the DoD. We recognize that our path to growth is not always linear, but with the opportunity that lies ahead, we continue to recruit and retain the top talent at a time when other companies in the technology sector are slashing their plans and cutting workforces.\nI'll hand it over to Shyam for further discussion regarding our business and product strategy moving forward.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCOO & Executive VP, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We have spent the last 2 decades building our products for the world in which we actually live. The disruption and uncertainty that we're seeing around us from Ukraine, the pandemic and inflation, it's driving customers towards us and to our software.\nAs the world continues to struggle with concurrent supply chain and energy crises, Palantir customers have been able to use Foundry to connect and integrate decision-making within their value chain, from their suppliers to their customers to instantly trade off possible courses of action. You just saw highlights from 2 flagship events we held in Palo Alto and London for our customers to share their experiences with each other. Customers underscored the significant impact our software is having across industries. Executives at Tyson Foods shared how they generated $200 million of annualized savings in 24 months. Jacobs Engineering shared how our software has reduced energy consumption by 1/5 at its first wastewater plant running on Foundry, with the potential to generate $90 million of annualized savings across their 300 plants. Swiss Re shared that they saved more than $100 million in the first year of use alone. More than 35% of employees at Swiss Re use our software on a regular basis. Our moment of macroeconomic uncertainty, that differentiation has never been more valuable to the market than today.\nThese customers consistently focus on our ontology as the decisive factor in delivering results quickly. Our strength, particularly in the U.S. commercial market, has also received increasing recognition across the industry. Gartner ranked us as a visionary in data integration. IDC ranked Palantir as the #1 AI software platform worldwide by 2021 market share and sales, beating Microsoft, IBM, Amazon and Google. Forrester named Palantir as the leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms. And there is no place where time-to-kinetic impact is more important than on the battlefield. In the government sector, Gotham has become the choice for U.S. and allied defense organizations around the world. We have now officially received DoD IL6 accreditation, a critical milestone for our broader government business, further enabling our SaaS offering on Secret networks. And our new Fed-start offering builds on Apollo to enable software companies to achieve FedRAMP authorization in record time and at a fraction of the cost.\nIn addition, we had our TITAN vehicle on display at the annual AUSA conference, where it was met with positive reactions from the U.S. government, partner nations and the industrial base. From the kill chain to the supply chain, our products ensure that there are no missing links.\nI'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financial results from this quarter.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nOur U.S. business continues to be the most significant driver of our growth. U.S. revenue grew 31% year-over-year to 297 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, U.S. revenue grew to $1.11 billion. Our commercial revenue in the United States grew 53% year-over-year to $88 million. And our core U.S. commercial revenue, which excludes our strategic investment program, grew 47% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.\nU.S. government revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $209 million. On customer count, our net new U.S. commercial customers grew 124% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter, marking 7 consecutive quarters of sequential growth greater than 10%.\nTurning to our global top line results. Third quarter total revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $478 million, ahead of our prior guidance even when factoring in an additional $1.4 million currency headwind since we issued guidance. Overall net dollar retention was 119%, remaining constant quarter-over-quarter.\nCommercial revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $204 million. Our international commercial business was roughly flat year-over-year and continues to be affected by both macroeconomic conditions and the strengthening dollar. A number of our customers in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia enter into contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. And as a result, the strong dollar has been a significant headwind for them.\nGovernment revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $274 million. We saw our government business cross another major milestone this quarter as we generated $1.02 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Our customer count continues to increase at a significant rate. We added 33 net new customers in the third quarter, bringing our Q3 2022 customer count to 337, a 66% increase year-over-year and an 11% sequential increase. We added 25 net new commercial customers, which represents 98% growth year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Our revenue within our existing customers also continues to expand. Trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 15% year-over-year to $48 million per customer.\nThird quarter billings were $509 million, up 47% year-over-year. In the third quarter, total contract value, or TCV, was $1.3 billion. U.S. TCV booked was $1.1 billion, 90% of which was attributable to our U.S. government business. The third quarter TCV figure was driven significantly by renewals and expansions of existing U.S. government contracts, a portion of which have already been funded to date.\nFor total remaining deal value, we ended the third quarter with $4.1 billion a 17% increase quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter growth in total remaining deal value was driven by our unusually strong performance in TCV.\nAs I previously mentioned, the TCV of our U.S. government contracts accounts for both funded and unfunded contract value, and we're seeing this pass-through to our total remaining deal value. We saw headwinds to remaining deal value as a result of executing on our previously announced plan to cancel all remaining unfunded strategic investment commitments.\nWe ended the third quarter with $1.3 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 43% year-over-year. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business.\nTurning to margins and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 80%. Third quarter adjusted expenses were $397 million, up 9% sequentially. The sequential increase was driven primarily by headcount-related expense as we had 450 net headcount additions in the quarter, our largest hiring quarter of the year, and including 141 new graduates who joined in quarter.\nThird quarter adjusted income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was $81 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 17%, 600 basis points ahead of our prior guidance. Our adjusted operating margin significantly exceeded our guidance as a result of several factors, but primarily driven by cloud and deployment efficiencies representing around $9 million of outperformance and the elimination of certain discretionary spend across the business, particularly in G&A, representing approximately $14 million of outperformance.\nWe expect to continue to see efficiencies in the fourth quarter, and we'll remain disciplined in our approach to the discretionary spend in this macroeconomic environment.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.01, which includes a negative $0.02 impact driven by losses on marketable securities. We generated $47 million in cash from operations and our adjusted free cash flow was $37 million, representing a margin of 10% and 8%, respectively. This marks our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $231 million in adjusted free cash flow and $238 million in cash flow from operations.\nWe ended the third quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $950 million through our $500 million revolving credit facility and $450 million delayed draw term loan facility, both of which remain entirely undrawn. Our balance sheet leaves us well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that may arise in the current macro environment.\nNow turning to our outlook. For the full year 2022, despite a negative $6 million currency impact since our prior quarter's guidance, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of between $1.9 billion and $1.902 billion. Excluding such impact, we would expect full year 2022 revenue of between $1.906 billion and $1.908 billion. We are raising our outlook for adjusted income from operations for the full year. We now expect adjusted income from operations of between $384 million and $386 million.\nFor the fourth quarter, after factoring in a negative $5 million currency impact since our prior quarter's guidance, we expect revenue of between $503 million and $505 million. Excluding such impact, we would expect fourth quarter revenue of between $508 million and $510 million. We expect adjusted income from operations of $78 million to $80 million.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A.",

Welcome to Palantir's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today.\nOur press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated.\nJoining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; Ryan Taylor, Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nIn the last 3 years, we have grown Palantir from a $743 million revenue business with hundreds of millions of dollars in actual loss to, in the last 12 months, a $1.74 billion business with $300 million in free cash flow, which represents a 41% CAGR. 41% CAGR on a business that is now in its 18th year is very unusual. There are many reasons for this strong growth, but you live by the same sword that you pay the price for. And we deal with very, very large contracts. And the USG has some of the large -- our largest contracts, and they have been pushed out. But because of uncertainty toward the end of the year, we're revisioning guidance down to $1.9 billion.\nI personally remain very optimistic that the next 3 years will look a lot like the last 3 years, again, where we took a money-losing business and made a business that throws off free cash flow; where we ended up as of today with $2.4 billion in the bank and no debt, and that the large and chunky nature of our contracts will continue to be, in large part, an advantage because these contracts do not disappear.\nSometimes, they are put off. Sometimes, they take too long for us to get them. But at the $1 billion range of the contracts that we are working on, they have the bug of sometimes taking too long and the feature of a highly difficult, tumultuous and politically uncertain world that you actually get paid and you actually make free cash flow.\nMoreover, we have 5 of the most interesting, important and crazy, baller, impactful products in the world: PG, Foundry, Nexus Peering, MetaConstellation and Apollo, all of which were built before their time, all of which have made a 41% CAGR possible. These products should be measured not just in their ability to throw off free cash flow, to generate outsized revenue, but most importantly, in their quintessential attribute that large companies, which essentially control distribution, cannot easily copy them, or if at all, they are too intricate, difficult and thick to be replaced by larger incumbents and then distributed through their distribution chain.\nIn the end, all software products actually have to be measured by is this replaceable, how easy could it be replaced, is the underlying platform durable or fleeting, and could a third party highly technical with massive distribution disrupt these products? If you look closely at PG, Foundry, Nexus Peering, MetaConstellation and Apollo, as different as they are, they have one thing in common: it would take many, many years of the world's best engineers to build them and it would take -- you would be building them as we've improved them and as we capture the market. Thank you.\n\nRyan D. Taylor\n\nChief Legal & Business Affairs Officer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThank you, Alex. We have the great privilege of being on the forefront of the problems that matter most in the world, from the war in Ukraine to fighting famine and monkeypox. Across government and commercial, the opportunity in front of us is enormous, which makes the revised near-term outlook all the more disappointing. It doesn't come close to representing our ambition and the opportunity before us.\nWhile the timing of large contracts in government can be frustrating, the underlying requirements and needs are enduring. It's worth noting that our revised guidance excludes any new major U.S. government awards.\nAt the same time, we have seen the opportunity presented by this environment before. As organizations around the world face more pressure and experience more pain, there will be a slowdown in the rate of spending and lengthening of sales cycles, but it will also reveal gaps in enterprises operations, gaps our software can solve.\nIn the short term, this means less revenue now. But on longer time horizons, it accelerates our business. The global financial crisis, ISIS attacks in Europe, the COVID pandemic, through each upheaval, we emerge substantially stronger by investing in our customers ahead of revenue and delivering results in days, not months.\nIt is exactly in times like these that we build our most important and most impactful partnerships. Each of these periods has been an inflection point for Palantir, a time during which we develop pathbreaking software platforms and expanded our footprint.\nTo our results. We generated $473 million in revenue in Q2 2022, representing a growth rate of 26% year-over-year and 6% sequential. Our customer count increased to 304, up from 169 a year ago. Our business in the United States alone generated more than $1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 42% growth.\nI'll now hand it over to Shyam.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCOO & Executive VP, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Our revenue growth in the U.S. commercial market continues to be our focus and is gathering momentum. Our U.S. commercial business grew 120%, rising from $39 million in Q2 2021 to $86 million this quarter. Our core U.S. commercial business, which excludes strategic investments, grew 10% quarter-over-quarter or greater for the past 4 quarters, most recently reaching $67.4 million, 14% sequential growth. Our core U.S. commercial ACV grew 2.4x, our best quarter ever.\nOur U.S. commercial customer count grew from 34 to 119 customers year-over-year. Our overall commercial revenue grew 46% and continued to increase for the ninth quarter in a row on a quarter-over-quarter basis, reaching $210 million in Q2. We are seeing former customers, particularly those in the U.S., including some of the world's largest transportation, banking and retail enterprises return to our platforms in increasing numbers after periods of experimentation with other platforms and approaches. These customers, they're not returning to our software platforms merely because of the expansion of our sales operations, which does continue, they are often returning because they have tried other options, and those options have failed to deliver needed results.\nOur commercial business in Europe and elsewhere outside the United States continues to expand as well, although the exceptional strength of the U.S. dollar has been a factor given the significantly increased effective cost of goods. Our government work remains at the center of everything that we have built and everything that motivates us. The expansion of our reach with agencies working on the front lines and conflicts around the world, including in Eastern Europe and the South China Sea, continues.\nThe contracts we have in our pipeline are key to facing the challenges in front of the West. Our government business grew to $263 million in revenue in Q2, rising 9% quarter-over-quarter. More broadly, across the commercial and government sectors, health care has become a substantial and rapidly growing business, generating approximately $153 million in revenue in the first half of 2022, up from $42 million in the first half of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. That represents a 91% compounded annual growth rate.\nWe see substantial opportunities for Palantir as a health care technology company, driving transformation across major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, insurers, providers, regulatory agencies and research organizations, building on our work with organizations such as the U.K.'s NHS, U.S. HHS, the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, Sanofi, Merck and Sompo's health care business in Japan.\nOur software products and platforms continue to operate behind the scenes in connection with some of the most significant events around the world, including the distribution of vaccines to millions and an ongoing war in Eastern Europe. One of our most recent offerings within Foundry, a no-code application development environment known as Workshop that allows users with little or no coding experience to build operational applications on top of data warehouses within minutes, is showing particularly strong growth with more than 10,000 developers now building applications within the platform.\nAnd our most recent offering, Pipeline Builder, brings this same no-code approach to authoring data pipelines, turning every business analyst into a production data engineer in Foundry. We just launched an experimental feature that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 to turn natural human language into pipeline logic. [Ascent] is like find me all the hospitals that have limited ICU bed availability in the next 3 weeks is transformed into a pipeline in seconds, a new standard in no code.\nForrester named Foundry the leader in AI platforms as part of the Forrester Wave AI/ML Platforms Q3 report. Palantir's Foundry operating system received the highest possible scores in the product vision, performance, market approach and applications criteria.\nTurning to Gotham. Urgent operational needs are driving innovation in our integrated hardware software offerings, building on products like TITAN. Skykit will combine Palantir's MetaConstellation software on a small human portable form factor with Starlink comms to enable heroes in the field to test low-latency, AI-driven satellite collection. Our focus in the short term remains on making our 3 principal software platforms: Gotham, Foundry and Apollo, available to broader segments of the market with unbeatable time to value.\nI'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Shyam. As we've highlighted, our U.S. business is remarkably strong. U.S. revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $290 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, U.S. revenue grew to $1.04 billion. U.S. commercial revenue grew 120% year-over-year to $86 million.\nOur core U.S. commercial revenue, which excludes our strategic investment program, grew 14% sequentially. On the customer side, our net new U.S. commercial customers grew 16% sequentially. U.S. government revenue increased 27% versus the year ago period to $205 million, up from a 16% year-over-year increase in the first quarter.\nTurning to our global top line results. Second quarter total revenue grew 26% year-over-year, ahead of our prior guidance to $473 million. Our overall net dollar retention was 119%. Commercial revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $210 million. Government revenue increased 13% versus the year ago period to $263 million.\nOur global customer acquisition remains strong. We added 27 net new customers in the second quarter, bringing our Q2 2022 customer count to 304, an 80% increase year-over-year. We added 19 net new commercial customers, which represents 157% growth year-over-year. Our growth with existing customers also continues to remain strong. Trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 17% year-over-year to $46 million. Second quarter billings were $396 million, up 5% year-over-year.\nIn the second quarter, TCV booked was $792 million. U.S. TCV booked was $588 million. As Alex mentioned, we saw that large, new USG contract awards have been pushed out. While government bookings grew quarter-over-quarter, increasing 128% sequentially, this was primarily driven by renewals. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion in total remaining deal value, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter.\nDespite the excellent TCV quarter, total remaining deal value was impacted primarily by 2 things: one, we voluntarily terminated several contracts related to investment commitments that we decided to not move forward with; two, our TCV number included the successful conversion of option years from a U.S. commercial customer contract that, while resulting in lower overall deal value, secured commitment for additional years. We ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 79% year-over-year.\nAs a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business.\nTurning to our margins and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 81%. Second quarter adjusted income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was $108 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 23%, ahead of our prior guidance of 20%.\nSecond quarter adjusted expenses were $365 million, up 11% sequentially. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was negative $0.01, which includes a negative $0.05 impact driven primarily by losses on marketable securities. We generated $62 million in cash from operations, and our adjusted free cash flow was $61 million, representing a margin of 13% and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow on an adjusted basis.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, we have generated $314 million in adjusted free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. In July, we expanded our revolving credit facility by adding a $450 million new incremental delayed draw term loan facility, which provides for additional liquidity up to $950 million and remains entirely undrawn. As we highlighted last quarter, our balance sheet leaves us uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that may arise from the larger macroeconomic environment.\nNow turning to our outlook. We are presently guiding to the third quarter and full year 2022. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of between $474 million and $475 million and adjusted operating income of $54 million to $55 million. For full year 2022, we now expect revenue of between $1.9 billion and $1.902 billion, and adjusted operating income of $341 million to $343 million. This revised guidance excludes any new major U.S. government awards, and we believe this to be the base case.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A.",

Welcome to Palantir's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nFurther, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.\nJoining me today on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated.\nI'll turn the call over to Alex.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our earnings. We are in London. In past earnings calls and over the course of 2 decades, we've been involved in many of the most important things that have affected Western society. But what makes these times special is the trends that we believed would happen are happening at an accelerating rate. And what's super interesting is why is the broader world so late in recognizing how these things are accelerating. What's happening? What is the genesis of the escapism that our broader institutions, financial, cultural, legal, technical, why are they escaping to the metaverse or faculty lounge jargon or political structures that are clearly not solving problems where inputs and outputs are totally anti, if at all, correlated?\nWhy is it that we are unable to see the violence that is occurring as truly something that it will be part of our ongoing future and not as episodic? Why do we describe these things as uncertainty when they are certain and are happening? Why is it that our institutions are not even pretending that they will be able to hold the center while simultaneously pretending the center will coagulate to a center independent of new structures, new ways of doing things, of new products, new institutions, new ideas?\nPart of that is we have theological structures around how we build, for example, in our space, products. And that theology presupposes that the world will be stable. So specialized things we build for both commercial and, for example, special forces, things that are powering current events now were built over the last 2 decades precisely because if you are in the periphery doing the most sensitive and important work in the world as you need to be able to interact with your software in a way where it's disconnected and reconnects simple problem, normal software sucks at it, you need a very specialized product. We've been supplying this to the world's most important elite soldiers for nearly a decade under the context of what we call Nexus Peering.\nYou need an ability to interact with space where you solve certain problems involving compute and involving the reduction of data using colloquially defined AI tuned by Foundry getting that to the soldier. You need to be able to, in the context of commercial entities, rebuild the supply chain because there's war. Obviously, there's going to be food shortages. There's disruptions. You can no longer get certain resources from countries. You have to get them from others overnight. The systems literally presupposed that will never happen, and therefore, fall completely apart when it does happen.\nThere is no plan for when it doesn't happen. This is why -- even though we've been a completely focused product company that is only focused on building these building products and we have new products coming and not as focused on actually convincing people that we're right. They still sell because the other products are not built for this world. You have a financial context. It's like we have raging inflation. We are very likely to see this will increase. The risk of a nuclear event is so much higher than it's being presented in the public world that it's almost surreal to watch the coverage. And yet, there's really no idea of what you would do with evaluating the quality of revenue.\nSo that Palantir, for example, we're a company to thrive in good times and we thrive in bad times. We are not built in the way the theologians of our financial institutions would love us to be built. So that you're built exactly like if we had listened to them, we would only be growth and no free cash flow. We're a company that throws off free cash flow. We're a company that expected inflation. We're obviously super committed to the mission. But it was obvious to us even at inception in bad times, the quality of government revenues would be crucial because other revenues would be -- would suffer from inflation.\nThey would have a lower quality. They'd be less sticky. We built these products for the right reasons. And we're not ashamed to say that we're winning maybe because we were right. We didn't want to be right. But some of this stuff was so obvious. It was obvious that these institutions, the theology of how we model these things in every context is just corrosive. So you end up with the wrong products, the wrong quality of revenue. So you have growth without free cash flow or free cash flow without growth. You have products that work now that can be hyped up with sales, but clearly are not going to work the day after tomorrow. No ability to build new products. Why would you build new products? You're going to have this perfectly tinkered model, get the institutions to invest in you and acquire all these companies that actually build product. Yes, but it's neatly impossible to build products for tomorrow.\nThere aren't companies to acquire. You actually have to do it yourself. Sure, here and there, you can look for things to accelerate. Palantir has done that. So we -- you have to -- we at Palantir are not fleeing to a different world, whether it's the metaworld or a theological world or a financial version of theological world or a grad school version of theological world, which isn't even actually academic because academic presupposes interacting with the object from a theoretical perspective, differentiate from the object, not importing a theological, preconceived version of the object onto the theory and reimporting that onto the object.\nProducts don't work like that. Reality doesn't work like that. Palantir, we are playing a critical, crucial and much bigger role than we're allowed to mention or would ever discuss in public in current events, obviously, commercially, because our partners and other future partners are being disrupted. Their supply chains are disrupted. There's a threat of a disruption in the broader economy. And we are -- and many realize that the reality of a truly monumental, epic and horrific disruption in the form of a nuclear attack is much higher than is being reported. But also in the government context where we are playing an outsized role, and we're very proud of that and we're proud of the people we're able to support. And we're also eager to continue to help to support them.\nI must also say the people who've -- watching this, many of whom share our belief that the future is to be won by people who accept the reality of what it is and not what it ought to be. That you can only change the ought by accepting what is. That you've stuck with us and I hope will stick with us, and we are going to continue supplying the world's most important products to the most interesting, creative and effectual people in the world and continue to thrive as this hybrid company that is both bull and baron comes into full stride in both environments, but in absolutely anomalous stride when times are rough and people are hiding.\nPalantir's products are on the absolute front line and you see them in the news every day. And we would love someday to discuss exactly what we're doing. But we are playing a good role in your support and buying into the world as it is, is enormously important to us. Thank you.\n\nShyam Sankar\n\nCOO & Executive VP, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nIn Q1, revenue grew 31%. Commercial revenue grew 54%, accelerating for the fifth quarter in a row. U.S. commercial revenue grew 136%, also accelerating for the fifth quarter in a row. We added 40 new customers, growing customer count 86% year-over-year.\nWe had GAAP operating margins of negative 9% versus negative 33% a year ago, reflecting our continued march to GAAP profitability. And we had adjusted operating margins of 26%. We have been building our company and our products for this world. The stability on which so many models that purported to explain the world rely, it's vanished, if it ever existed at all. We have built a company for the world that is not the world that ought to be. And it is instability not its absence that makes our software all the more essential. As our customers confront an extraordinarily significant and rapidly escalating conflict in Eastern Europe, runaway inflation-disrupted supply chains and a new wave of refugees, our products have become more essential than ever.\nAt our last earnings call, the invasion of Ukraine had not yet occurred. From the moment those tanks rolled into Ukraine, we have been delivering our capabilities to the front. We have been continuously shipping innovation over the course of the conflict to provide western militaries the software that they need to fulfill their missions. Every product and capability has been employed by our customers from Gaia, Gotham, Edge AI, Foundry, Nexus Peering and more. And the newest of them, MetaConstellation, continues to deliver value in making space-based collection truly operational, delivering significant mission outcomes.\nAnd we have been working across Poland, Lithuania, the U.K. and other nations to power refugee relief operations. Our software is powering the World Food Programme's Ukraine response, getting aid as Far East as possible. And across our commercial customers, we are powering resilience to a whole new set of supply chain shocks.\nReal-world events are driving enormous and long-term opportunities for growth. We are on the front lines, seeing what needs to exist, hearing from commanders and users and building now what is needed and what will power the next decade of U.S. and allied defense programs. We did this a decade ago in Afghanistan with Nexus Peering. We did this a year ago with MetaConstellation whose impact writes headlines in The New York Times. And we will continue building this offer of the future, ramping our investment heavily across the business in the face of these Palantir-shaped macro conditions.\nThis focus has delivered tremendous depth in our R&D and our full stack IP. We now have this opportunity, in addition to releasing new products at pace to bring an increasing amount of that innovation to market. And that's what you're seeing with Apollo. We believe Apollo will fundamentally change how software is deployed, anticipating a future where multi-tenant SaaS is dead and is clearly dying in the present, a trend that is accelerated by geopolitical events.\nEvery software company will need to be able to deploy their software into their customers' environments, requiring them to manage fleets of heterogeneous environments across public clouds, on-premises, sovereign clouds and growing data jurisdictional boundaries and to do all of that seamlessly. Apollo will take customers from a world of continuous deployment to autonomous deployment. And we have been pleased with the market reception to Apollo in our Demo Day event, really being received by a completely new buying audience.\nWe are also now offering Nexus Peering as a stand-alone capability for customers to build their own data fabrics on top of. Over a decade ago, we pioneered a technology that enabled Gotham to reason about the causality of a distributed system of many, many different Gotham nodes. These nodes could all have independent concurrent edits to the same objects and Nexus Peering meant that we could synchronize these edits across the network, either in real time with consistent comps as well as across unreliable, intermittent and disconnected environments.\nNexus Peering means that you have a distributed data fabric that is survivable and resilient. The loss of any number of nodes or facilities won't impact the whole. This is a core and fundamental hard technology breakthrough that has powered Gotham's unique success across coalition information sharing for defense and intelligence agencies. And by enabling Nexus Peering to be sold as a separate capability, we can enable every program in the Department of Defense to leverage this distributed data synchronization and data fabric as we further demonstrate our own commitment to DoD's modular open systems approach.\nThe greatest opportunity for Foundry continues to be the application development infrastructure platform. We believe that Foundry will become the place that you go to build the applications of the future. With AWS or Azure, with their highly unopinionated collection of services, most of the work remains in front of you to get to value. And all of that onus is on you, the customer, to get to that value.\nWith Foundry, you're 90% of the way there on day 1. Software-defined data integration, native multi-tenancy for your applications, the OPIs, version pipelines, applications, artifacts, to just name some of the components that make Foundry work from the start.\nThat's why U.S. Space Force's Kobayashi Maru software factory realized their ambition, building 13 operationally accepted applications on top of Foundry in months while sunsetting legacy $100 million-plus programs. That's why Airbus rolled out an internally developed supply chain network control tower, a suite built on top of Foundry's application development infrastructure. And this set of applications, it mitigates supply chain issues and is working towards saving hundreds of millions of euros annually by speeding up production against existing fixed capacity and reducing inventory across all parts. What AWS was in the last decade, Foundry will be in the next.\nTurning to the highlights in our commercial business. We added 37 net new customers in Q1. We saw continued growth in automotive, in financial services, in energy, including a new super major customer and in life sciences. In April, we closed a renewal with a major U.S. Fortune 100 company for over $150 million. This customer hosted a hackathon with over 600 participants featuring applications built in under 4 days across finance, build planning, network resiliency and customer experience. This was a good and telling example of how scaled customers built better on Palantir as application development infrastructure. Last quarter, we saw continued interest in our modular offerings.\nHospitals need to improve operational efficiencies surrounding patient flow and staffing processes in order to decrease the length of stay and ensure patients have access to proper care. Palantir's hospital operation suite has proven a unique ability to solve these problems through collaborative decision-making based on real-time data with targeted, event-driven notifications and actionable AI. Palantir's hospital operations suite is now used by hospitals covering over 37,000 beds across the U.S., up from just over 1,000 on January 1.\nTurning to government. As instability in the world increases, we continue to double down on our support of the missions of the West's most critical foundational institutions. Our ambition is to be the sixth prime contractor for the U.S. federal government, a trusted partner to deliver complex, end-to-end, integrated hardware and software solutions, building on the legacy of programs that we prime today. But we seek to be the first company to do this as a software prime, using software innovation and our unmatched expertise to deliver new, integrated hardware software capabilities faster than the pace of conflict.\nIn Q1, we launched our U.S. Federal Advisory Board, an important milestone in this journey. The war is not just happening on the ground in Ukraine, but also in space. And accordingly, our opportunities in the space universe continue to expand. U.S. Space Force continues to deliver new operational capabilities to America's space guardians who have set the gold standard for allies. This is leading to substantial interest in U.S. Space Force's Warp Core platform, which was built on Foundry amongst allied nations.\nAt Space Symposium in Colorado Springs to an audience of U.S. and allied governments, Peter Marquez, the former Head of Space Policy at the National Security Council and the Head of Space Policy at AWS, presented Project Argus, a new space situational awareness platform built on Foundry. We closed a GBP 10 million enterprise expansion with the U.K. Royal Navy. Palantir's software is used by the Royal Navy across a broad spectrum of areas from strategic workforce planning to supply chain management.\nAnd world events have accelerated our opportunity in Western and Northern Europe. In Germany, we were awarded a framework agreement for state and federal government organizations to purchase Gotham and Foundry with an initial order coming from the Bavarian Police, adding to our existing German security customers in North-Rhine Westphalia and Hesse. Our government health care business grew with an expansion with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The growth of the work is reflected in the doubling of the run rate. Over the past year, while continuing to deliver on the CDC's food-borne pathogen program, which we have been powering since 2009, the CDC expanded Foundry's pathogen surveillance and response work and deployed generalized modules built on top of a common Foundry ontology against new pathogens, including measles, mumps, Legionella and novel flu. The CDC is also using Foundry to process genetic sequence data derived from wastewater samples.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, our continued investments in software-defined data integration with our newest pipeline builder product continues to pay off at the NHS where they were able to roll out Foundry to 38 hospitals, integrating hundreds of data sets in March alone to enable them to work through the national care backlog.\nI'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financials.\n\nDavid A. Glazer\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nAs Alex and Shyam highlighted, we're uniquely positioned for unstable times. We work with some of the most crucial and important institutions in the world. The U.S. government was 42% of our first quarter revenue and has been a leading driver of growth for 8 years, with a 30% CAGR from 2013 to 2021, which we view as a long-term trend.\nMore fundamentally, we believe supplying our products to the U.S. government and her allies is a core pillar of our business. As Alex mentioned, in the face of substantial macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and uncertainty, the quality of our revenue as viewed through growth, margin performance and durability and especially resilience is unique to Palantir.\nAs Alex wrote in his letter, we combine the resilience of the defense industrial sector with the growth of a software company. In the face of our customers' challenges, we have and will continue to incur expenses prior to having contracts in the delivery of mission-critical capabilities. Following these investments, we expect acceleration of our U.S. government revenue into the second half of the year. In Q2 to date, we've already seen the reacceleration of U.S. government revenue and expect acceleration of the overall government segment to follow in the next quarter or shortly thereafter.\nI'll now review our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook. First quarter revenue grew 31% year-over-year ahead of our prior guidance to $446 million. Overall net dollar retention was 124%. Commercial revenue growth accelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter. First quarter commercial revenue increased 54% year-over-year to $205 million, up from a 47% increase in the fourth quarter. Commercial growth continues to be driven by our U.S. business as U.S. commercial revenue growth accelerated to 136% in the first quarter, up from 132% in Q4.\nInternational commercial revenue growth accelerated in Q1 to 24% year-over-year, up from 22% in Q4 and 7% a year ago. Our U.S. business revenue grew 38% versus the year ago period. Government revenue increased 16% versus the year ago period to $242 million. Adjusted operating margin was 26%, ahead of our prior guidance by roughly 300 basis points.\nOur customer acquisition continues to accelerate. We added 40 net new customers in the first quarter, up from 34 in the fourth quarter. We had our strongest quarter of net commercial customer adds, adding 37 commercial net adds, which equals 25% sequential growth and 207% year-over-year growth. We expect continued growth in commercial customer acquisition throughout the year. Our growth with existing customers remains strong. Trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 24% year-over-year to nearly $45 million.\nFirst quarter billings were $490 million, up 35% year-over-year. First quarter ACV closed increased 35% year-over-year on the back of 208 deals versus 81 deals in the year ago period. First quarter TCV closed was $248 million. The U.S. government's businesses TCV has been impacted by the continuing resolution. But now that a new budget has been passed, we're already seeing Q2 U.S. government revenue reaccelerate.\nAdditionally, with the geopolitical landscape outlined by Alex, we expect government bookings activity to increase for the remainder of the year, resulting in stronger government revenue growth in the second half of 2022. We ended the first quarter with $3.5 billion in total remaining deal value, up 26% year-over-year, while duration shortened 4% over the same period. We ended the first quarter with $1.2 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 86% year-over-year.\nAs a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business.\nMargins and expenses are on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin was 81%. Contribution margin was 57%. First quarter adjusted income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was $117 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 26%, ahead of our prior guidance of 23%.\nFirst quarter adjusted expenses were $329 million, up 7% sequentially. We are spending to position the company and our customers to win in the current geopolitical environment. These investments in product and our customers will continue over the balance of 2022.\nFirst quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.02, which includes a negative $0.02 impact driven primarily by unrealized losses on marketable securities. We generated $35 million in cash from operations and $30 million in adjusted free cash flow. Cash flows vary quarter-to-quarter, but it's worth noting the $66 million increase in our accounts receivable balance.\nAt the end of Q1, we had a very strong war chest, $2.3 billion in cash and no debt. In march, we expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million, up from $400 million previously. And our credit facility remains entirely undrawn. Our balance sheet leaves us ideally positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that may arise from further deterioration of global conditions.\nTurning to our outlook. We are guiding to a base case of $407 million in revenue for Q2. There's a wide range of potential upside above our guidance, including those driven by our role in responding to developing geopolitical events. We expect second quarter adjusted operating margin of 20% in the base case as we accelerate investments to support our customers' mission in advance of anticipated contract awards and continue to expect full year adjusted operating margin of 27%. We expect and are already seeing an acceleration of our U.S. government revenue resulting from these investments.\nContinuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO, Alex Karp, in our year-end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide guidance of 30% or greater revenue growth for this year and the next 3 years at each earnings call.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rodney to open up Q&A.\n\nRodney Nelson\n\nHead of IR, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. Joining me for Q&A are Shyam Sankar, Dave Glazer and Kevin Kawasaki.",

Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.\n\nAlexander C. Karp\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWelcome to our earnings call from Denver. It's my maiden voyage. And obviously, just a couple of opening remarks, and then we'll jump into questions from the audience as it were. The -- just a 5-minute, 2-minute -- when Palantir began, people believed that data was worthless, that software was a luxury item, and that we would fail. And one of the very interesting things that's happened to Palantir is we've been able to see how the world has changed dramatically in its perception of software and, of course, of us from a world where software was something that you might want, might be in your car, but de facto would not determine your business to a world where really the laws of finance are going to be rewritten to deal with a world where the only real moat is software.\nHow do you measure it? What does it look like? How does it -- how do you understand when it's creating value? How do you understand when it's declining in value? How do you understand when it's compounding? To what extent is it compounding? What devices do we use to measure that? Are the devices we use to measure it the ones that we used in the past? Clearly, this industry is in its infancy. What's also very special about this industry is it really is, by and large, geographically located in a small section of America, which is odd, and there's lots of interesting reasons for that. but enterprise software is something that America is by far the best at.\nWhat we see currently at Palantir is not just the best at building it. It seems to also be the best at understanding what software developments are relevant for the world today and adapting even when it's being offered by a company that in every way looks nonstandard, run by people that are very different, look different, feel different, talk differently and with a CEO that many of you is batch crazy.\nAnd so, just as an interesting preview, I don't want to take a ton of time with remarks because I think when I'm watching these things, if someone talks too long or there's like a lot of canned remarks, I wonder why honestly gets a little boring. And of course, our legal apartment and IR department, which are wonderful departments are -- have a cane ready to pull me out if I'm not like a caged animal in the 1950 zoo. As I've mentioned to them, if you went caged animals in 1950 zoo, you can watch any other earnings update.\nSo here, you see an interesting chart. We sent this out. Some of you have probably looked at it. Some have maybe even studied it. Some of you haven't seen it. What's interesting here, what I thought would be very interesting for people who are investors, potential investors, also Palantirians, both current and ex, is our journey and what I actually believe this is a metaphor for the journey of all software companies. We had -- we were very early into whatever you want to call data exploration, building things that would now be understand as useful software for building analytic tools. Some of them were -- and are very, very important for national security and other areas. But then we're not -- obviously, because they were built and conceived in 2004, delivered in 2008, we're not actually able to migrate across the chain into what people need tomorrow, where people are already seeing that they need today, which is essentially not having software as a raw material exploration.\nYou take the data, like it's oil, you pump it out, you churn it, and then you save churned the data and you move on, but actually operationally determinative for your business. What you see here is cohort analysis. This is the -- and what you see is from inception of Foundry, the decline of older software products and just the massive exponential growth, obviously, use rough math. It's 100% growth year-on-year. And then starting last year, not off of a small integral, which is obviously very important because small numbers can go quickly even if the software is not strong. Big numbers don't go quickly if the software doesn't exist, especially given that our sales force is super nascent. We're building it quickly, but we only have 25 fully accredited software fully accredited meaning they've been here for 9 months or more. And what you see here, obviously, the CAGR here is just unbelievable and in like the 150 plus range, which is a super interesting and I wanted to drop the F-bomb here, but I was told that was probably inappropriate, but you could definitely -- we've agreed that this is something like the Phoenix rises. You don't get this.\nAnd the other thing that's kind of anti-gravitational about this, that it's easy to forget. This is a company, this is like we've been at this for over 15 years. There are certain laws of nature in business that we are defined, which is that a software company, software usually decays for lots of reasons, decays radically. And so when you see a decline or a software product, it's also basically not part of the law of nature for a software company to build new software. Really, as far as I know, we are the only software company in the world building transformational software this far in. And that's particularly important because most software companies have distribution or they have a product, but they don't have distribution product and the ability to build new products. There's just not a critique. These are great companies. They acquire companies. They are not that many companies to acquire, which is why even relatively weak acquired at a very high price.\nLet's just look at the next chart, which is USG. USG, you have a very similar phenomenon where you see the inception of Foundry into the USG. This is -- there's a lot here. There's a lot of qualitative stuff here that we can explain, but one of the qualitative things that you kind of get a sense of is Palantir, the newer Foundry version not only grows dramatically with like -- this is like 65% growth just without looking at it more precisely, but it's over -- it's like over 200% CAGR here, which is also like Phoenix rises kind of thing. But what's qualitatively, particularly important and very protective is these graphs pretty neatly on to what are the programs that are going to grow tomorrow. Where is the future of USG? What do we need in a world where people are recognizing it's very dangerous? And what would the products be that you would need to power that. And so any case with that, I think we should head into questions.",

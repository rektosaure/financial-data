Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nick Arens, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nJennifer Mary Bush\n\nVP & President of Power Systems\n\nThank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the third quarter of 2025. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of the most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter accomplishments and financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. Finally, I'll provide an update on how we are navigating the evolving trade and policy landscapes, along with our market outlook for the remainder of the year. Mark will then take you through more details of our third quarter financial performance.\nBefore getting into the details of our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the third quarter. In September, we announced a collaboration with Komatsu to develop hybrid powertrains for surface haulage heavy mining equipment. This joint development effort will leverage the breadth and scale of Komatsu and Cummins' global capabilities to enable the acceleration of optimized hybrid solutions for mining. Retrofit hybrid solutions hold the potential to help mining customers accelerate their decarbonization journey today while lowering the cost of operations of their installed fleet assets. We are excited about this opportunity to bridge current operational needs with future low-carbon goals to support our customers' sustainability efforts.\nAdditionally, our latest 15-liter engine delivered standout results during this quarter's Run on less: Messy Middle event hosted by the North America Council for Freight efficiency. 3 of the 13 participating fleets ran the new X15N natural gas engine through some of the most demanding duty cycles of the demonstration, showcasing its ability to deliver true heavy-duty performance while unlocking the cost and emissions benefits of natural gas. At the same event, our X15 diesel led in fuel economy and operational efficiency, reinforcing its position as a benchmark for dependable high-performance power. These results highlight the growing adoption of Cummins' technologies and the tangible value customers are experiencing from our advanced powertrain solutions, all produced here in the U.S.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2025 and cover some of our key markets. Sales for the third quarter were $8.3 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Lower sales were primarily driven by weaker North America heavy and medium-duty truck demand with unit volumes declining 40% from a year ago, which was largely offset by continued strength in our global power generation markets, higher light-duty truck volumes and favorable pricing.\nEBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.3% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.4% a year ago. Third quarter 2025 results included $240 million of noncash charges related to our electrolyzer business within the Accelera segment, reflecting lower demand expectations due to reduced U.S. government incentives and slower market development internationally. Excluding those charges, EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 17.2% of sales, an increase of 80 basis points from a year ago as the benefits of higher power generation and light-duty truck volumes pricing, operational efficiencies and lower compensation expenses more than offset declines in North American truck volumes and the unfavorable impact from tariffs.\nWe did increase the proportion of tariff costs recovered through pricing and other mitigation actions in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. However, the magnitude of total tariff costs increased from Q2 as expected, and the net impact to Cummins was negative year-over-year.\nOur third quarter revenues in North America decreased 4% compared to 2024. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 46,000 units, down 34% from 2024 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 16,000, down 38% from a year ago. Industry production in the medium duty trucks was 20,000 units in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of 51%, while our unit sales were 17,000, down 55% from 2024. We shipped 40,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2025, up 44% from 2024 levels, driven by a ramp-up of model year '25 product, which was launched earlier this year.\nRevenues for North America power generation equipment increased 27%, driven by continued strength in data center demand. Our international revenues increased by 2% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, up 16% from a very weak quarter last year as stronger unit demand was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and weaker part sales.\nIndustry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 311,000 units, an increase of 50% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 35%. The increase in the China market size was primarily due to higher-than-expected domestic demand driven by NS4 scrapping incentives. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter was 54,000 units, an increase of 22% from 2024 levels. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 9,000, an increase of 18%. The increase in the China market size is primarily driven by domestic rural development and small infrastructure projects as well as strong export demand. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 26% in the third quarter due to accelerating data center demand.\nThird quarter revenues in India, including joint venture, were $713 million, an increase of 3% from a year ago, as stronger demand across markets was partially offset by depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. Industry truck production increased 6% from 2024 while our shipments increased 8%, driven primarily by domestic demand recovery as well as a pre-buy in advance of the potential goods and service tax rate changes. Power Generation revenues increased 41% in the third quarter, driven by strong data center demand.\nTo summarize, we achieved strong results led by record performance in our Power Systems and Distribution segments which were offset by sharp declines in the North America heavy and medium-duty truck demand, which negatively impacted our engine and components businesses. We expect the near-term weakness in North America on-highway truck markets to persist at least through the end of this year. Across all North America on-highway applications, we anticipate unit shipments declining approximately 15% from third quarter levels with most of the reduction expected in light and heavy-duty trucks. This reflects some normalization in light-duty trucks after strong Q3 ramp-up in the new model production along with fewer production days in the quarter and continued weakness in heavy-duty trucks. While we believe Q4 on-highway engine production could mark the bottom of this cycle, the pace of recovery in these markets will depend on broader economic sentiment and the clarity of trade and regulatory policies. While near-term challenges remain in our shorter cycle markets, we continue to see strong demand for power generation equipment beyond this year.\nThe global trade and policy landscapes remain dynamic, presenting ongoing challenges across our industry. As anticipated, tariff costs increased in the third quarter. We are nearing full recovery for those tariffs announced prior to the third quarter and are currently assessing any incremental impacts from the more recent announcements, including the medium and heavy-duty vehicle Section 232 proclamation. We believe, overall, we are well positioned to support our customers and keep the U.S. economy moving with our long-established strategy of making products in the U.S. for the U.S. market.\nRising geopolitical tensions could also pose risks to semiconductor supply and other products that utilize rare earth minerals, potentially impacting our supply chain and broader industry production. So far this year, we have not experienced significant disruptions to our production, and we are actively monitoring this evolving situation and taking steps to mitigate risk where we can.\nThe reduction of government incentives in the U.S. to support the adoption of green hydrogen, along with slower-than-expected market development in some international markets has contributed to significantly lower demand for our electrolyzer products. As a result, we are undergoing a strategic review of our electrolyzer business to assess the best path forward, and there may be further charges as we respond to a very weak demand outlook.\n2025 has presented significant challenges for our industry, as I've outlined, requiring us to focus even more on cost containment and risk mitigation than we had anticipated at the start of the year. Our experienced leadership team and dedicated employees have worked tirelessly to navigate these dynamics and also capitalize on the growing demand for power generation equipment and significantly improve company performance cycle over cycle. Looking ahead, we are hopeful that global trade policy will stabilize and that the administration's review of the 2027 EPA regulations will conclude in the coming months. This clarity will be critical for our industry and will support our plan to reinstate guidance for 2026 in February.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in what can be best described as a tale of two economies, certainly here in the U.S.\nKey takeaways today are: number one, business trends in the third quarter played out as we communicated at a high level three months ago. Demand for our Power Systems and Distribution businesses remains very strong, driven in part by rising demand for backup power for data centers. U.S. truck production, on the other hand, slowed sharply with our shipments in heavy- and medium-duty truck engines down 27% from the second quarter, right in the middle of our uninspiring projection of a decline of between 25% and 30%.\nOur margins were strong with sales growth in Power Systems and Distribution, converted into EBITDA margin expansion and cost containment efforts across the company helped mitigate the impact of declining truck volumes in the U.S.\nAnd thirdly, also as we projected, the negative impact of tariffs continued to grow in the third quarter. However, we managed the net hit to our profitability through price recovery and other actions and the proportion of cost recovery in the third quarter increased sequentially.\nFourth, our operating cash flow was strong at $1.3 billion in the quarter. Amongst those highlights, it's worth reinforcing that we're extending our track record of meaningfully improving our performance cycle over cycle.\nNow let's take a little closer look at our results. Our revenues were $8.3 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Sales in North America decreased 4%, while international revenues increased 2%. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.4% of sales a year ago. Third quarter 2025 results included $240 million of noncash charges related to our electrolyzer business within the Accelera segment. Excluding those charges, EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 17.2% of sales. The higher EBITDA percent, excluding the noncash charges, was driven by higher power generation demand and light-duty truck volumes, pricing, strong operational efficiencies and lower compensation expenses all of which was partially offset by lower North American truck demand and the unfavorable impact of tariffs.\nNow I will go into a little bit more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 25.6% of sales compared to $2.2 billion or 25.7% of sales last year. 2025 margins included a $30 million noncash charge for inventory write-downs for our electrolyzer business, which were part of the previously mentioned noncash charges for Accelera. Excluding those charges, gross margin percent was 26%, improved from the prior year as a result of higher power generation demand and light-duty truck volumes, pricing, operational improvements, all offsetting negative truck and tariff impacts.\nSelling, admin and research expenses were $1.1 billion or 13.6% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales and reflected strong cost control across the company.\nJoint venture income of $104 million increased $5 million from the prior year. This increase was driven by higher China volumes within our engine and Power Systems segments. That was the primary driver.\nOther income decreased to a negative $186 million compared to $22 million of income from the prior year, which was primarily a result of the $200 million noncash goodwill impairment to the electrolyzer segment. Interest expense was $83 million flat with the prior year.\nThe all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 32.7%, which included $36 million per diluted share of increased tax expense related to The One Big beautiful Bill Act as a result of reduced foreign income deduction and research and development credits. We do anticipate cash benefits from our elections under this recent U.S. tax legislation, but the current period income statement impact was negative.\nAll-in net earnings for the quarter were $536 million or $3.86 per diluted share compared to $809 million or $5.86 per diluted share a year ago. Accelera noncash charges were $240 million or $1.73 per diluted share. Excluding the Accelera charges and the impact of adopting the recent U.S. tax legislation changes, our net earnings were $812 million or $5.85 per diluted share, down just $0.01 on the 40% decline in U.S. truck volumes.\nOperating cash flow was $1.3 billion compared to $640 million a year ago. We have significantly improved our credit metrics since absorbing the Meritor acquisition and are now in a position of greater flexibility for capital allocation.\nNow let me comment a little bit more on segment performance and the remainder of 2025. Tariff costs impacted all of our operating segments in the interest of time, I'm not going to call that out five times as I discuss each individual segment performance.\nFor the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.6 billion, a decrease of 11% from a year ago. EBITDA was 10%, a decrease from 14.7% as weaker North American and heavy-duty truck volumes, the costs and additional overhead of investing and deploying new engine platforms ahead of the 2027 emissions regulations, some weaker aftermarket sales were partially offset by higher volumes and pricing related to the launch of updated products in light-duty markets and overall disciplined cost management.\nComponents segment revenue was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 15% from a year ago. EBITDA was 12.5% compared to 12.9% of sales a year ago as weaker on-highway demand in North America was partially offset by operational efficiencies, take cost management and lower product coverage costs.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 7% from a year ago to a record $3.2 billion and EBITDA was also a record 15.5% compared to 12.5% of sales a year ago, driven by higher power generation demand and higher aftermarket earnings.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $2 billion, an increase of 18% from a year ago. EBITDA dollars were also a record at $457 million, increasing as a percent of sales from 19.4% to 22.9%, driven by strong volume, particularly in data center applications positive pricing and effective capacity expansions in a cost-effective way.\nAccelera revenues increased 10% to a record $121 million as increased e-mobility sales, partially offset lower electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss, excluding noncash charges $96 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $115 million a year ago, reflecting a lower cost base resulting from the actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn summary, we delivered strong profitability for the third quarter as a result of improved operational execution, strong demand in power generation markets and pricing that more than offset the sharp declines in North American truck markets and unfavorable impacts from tariffs, although it has to be noted that all of these factors were not uniform across each individual segment. While we saw an increased impact from tariffs in the third quarter, we've worked hard to mitigate the impact and expect to enter the fourth quarter close to a price cost neutral position for tariffs or for those tariffs that were announced prior to the third quarter. The ongoing addition and adjustment of tariffs continues to present challenges.\nIn summary, our third quarter results underscored Cummins' strong financial position and ability to navigate ongoing uncertainty. Our diversified portfolio and global network [ leaders ] well positioned to support our customers and continue to drive improvement in performance cycle over cycle. As we've discussed, we expect demand for power systems and distribution remained strong through the fourth quarter and going into 2026. At the risk of sounding cautiously optimistic, I hope that demand in North American on-highway markets is close to bottoming in the fourth quarter in what has been a protracted and difficult slow down. We do anticipate a further 15% decline in our engine shipments to on-highway markets in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.\nWe are hopeful of reinstating our guidance in February as we have -- we hope to have more clarity on trade and regulatory policies that hopefully will provide stability for the North American truck industry and the broader industrial economy. As these markets recover, we are confident in our ability to build on this year's strong performance and continue delivering value to shareholders.\nNow let me turn it back over to Nick.\n\nNicholas J. Arens\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.",

Thank you you may begin.\n\nThank you.\n\nGood morning, everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the second quarter of 2025.\n\nParticipating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Smith, Our Chief Financial Officer will be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start. Please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward looking statements within the meaning of the security and exchange.\n\nAct of $19 34, such statements express our forecasts expectations hopes beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.\n\nMore information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the risk factors section of our most recently fired filed annual report on Form 10-K, and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\n\nDuring the course of this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we will refer you to our website for a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at Dot.\n\nCalm.\n\nWith that out of the way I will turn you over to our chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\n\nThank you Nick good morning, everyone.\n\nDelivered impressive results in the second quarter led by record performance in our distribution and power system segment that more than offset continued softening in the North America truck market.\n\nThe record financial performance from these two segments, along with strong operational execution across our entire company led to EBITDA, increasing 310 basis points year over year, Despite North America, heavy and medium duty truck volumes declining 30% from a year ago.\n\nI am incredibly proud of our employees' continued focus on meeting customer commitments and delivering on our priorities.\n\nAnd I'm confident that our efforts will allow us to continue to operate from a position of strength.\n\nNow I'll move on to some highlights from our second quarter, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. Finally, I will provide an update on how uncertainties in our current environment may impact our end markets for the remainder of the year.\n\nMark will then take you through more details of our second quarter financial performance.\n\nIn the second quarter, we continued to make progress in the execution of our destination zero strategy with the introduction of a new product and our power systems segment.\n\nExpanding on the success of our acclaimed serious generator set we launched a new 17 liter engine platform generator that produces up to one megawatt of power.\n\nThe F 17 centers Gen set was developed to produce a larger power output within a compact footprint to meet the growing power demands an urban environment.\n\nWe're compact design and high performance is critical.\n\nA new Gen set is designed to support a wide range of critical market segments, such as commercial properties health care facilities and water treatment plant.\n\nIn July we also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $1 82 to $2 per share the 16th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend.\n\nDuring the quarter, we returned $251 million to shareholders in the form of dividends consistent with our long term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.\n\nNow ill comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2025 and cover some of our key markets.\n\nRevenues for the second quarter were $8 6 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to the second quarter of 2024.\n\nEBITDA was $1 6 billion or 18, 4% compared to $1 3 billion or 15, 3% a year ago and.\n\nGross margin improved 150 basis points from a year ago.\n\nThis improvement in profitability was driven by the benefits of higher power generation demand operational efficiencies pricing and lower compensation expenses.\n\nWhich more than offset lower North America truck volumes and the unfavorable net impact from tariffs.\n\nWe see a marked contrast in demand between longer cycle sectors, such as power generation, which also continues to benefit from some well established secular themes and.\n\nAnd declining confidence in some of our more economically sensitive shorter cycle markets in North America.\n\nParticularly traffic pickup in consumer related markets.\n\nWe anticipate this contrast will become more pronounced in the second half of the year.\n\nOur second quarter revenues in North America decreased 6% compared to 2024.\n\nIndustry production of heavy duty trucks in the second quarter was 57000 units down 27% from 2024 levels.\n\nWhile our heavy duty unit sales were 22000 down 29% from a year ago.\n\nIndustry production of medium duty trucks was 28000 units in the second quarter of 2025, a decrease of 36%.\n\nWhile our unit sales were 25000 down 35% from 2024.\n\nWe shipped 34000 engine Atlantis for use in the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2025 down 18% from 2024 level.\n\nRevenues for North America power generation equipment increased by 25% driven primarily by continued strong demand in data centers and mission critical applications.\n\nOur international revenues increased by 5% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago.\n\nSecond quarter revenues in China, including joint Ventures were $1 8 billion, an increase of 9% as accelerating data center demand and higher domestic truck demand driven by government stimulus more than offset lower export demand.\n\nIndustry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China with 304000 units an increase of 13% from last year.\n\nOur sales and units, including joint ventures were 43000, an increase of 31%.\n\nThe increase in China market size is primarily due to higher than expected domestic demand driven by NSS for scrapping incentives.\n\nIndustry demand for excavators in China in the second quarter was 59000 units an increase of 11% from 2024 level.\n\nOur units sold were 11000, an increase of 13%.\n\nAn increase in the China market size is primarily due to domestic cyclical replacement demand rural development and farmland renovation demand.\n\nSales of power generation equipment in China increased 32% in the second quarter due to accelerating data center demand.\n\nSecond quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $699 million, a decrease of 1% from the second quarter a year ago.\n\nIndustry truck production increased 1% from 2020 for.\n\nPower generation revenues increased 31% in the second quarter, driven by increases in GE drive and data center demand.\n\nTo summarize we achieved impressive results in the second quarter with record financial performance in our power system systems and distribution segments.\n\nAs we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect North America, heavy and medium duty truck volumes to decline, 25% to 30% from second quarter levels as.\n\nAs we are seeing truck orders recently reached multiyear lows and Oems have initiated reduced work weeks through the next three months.\n\nThe duration of this reduced demand in North America truck markets will largely depend on the trajectory of the broader economy, the evolution of trade and tariff policies and.\n\nAnd the pace at which regulatory clarity emerges.\n\nDespite the challenges in the North America truck market, we have the benefit of operating a diversified global business.\n\nAnd expect continued strength in our power generation market. In addition to stability in our aftermarket and industrial businesses.\n\nTariffs are undoubtedly having an impact on comments, our suppliers customers and end users, creating uncertainty over freight activity linked to the movement of goods and increasing costs.\n\nWe did experience increasing tariff costs in the second quarter. However, as anticipated we did not see the full impact of the current policies and supply chain work through existing inventory we.\n\nBeen active in our efforts to mitigate tariff exposures and negotiate agreements with customers that position us to in our fourth quarter near full recovery.\n\nAdditionally, although we primarily produce engines and gen sets in the markets, where we sell them. We are further mitigating our efforts by continuing to evaluate and implement dual sourcing where possible and economically viable for our supply base and component manufacturing.\n\nAs we navigate these uncertainties, we will continue to maintain disciplined by managing our costs, while continuing to invest to meet our critical priorities. So that we are well positioned as markets recover.\n\nIn summary, we had a strong second quarter performance that demonstrates the earnings potential of common at a time when demand in North America, and China truck market since the week level.\n\nWhile we expect demand in North America truck markets to decline significantly in the third quarter from second quarter levels, we remain well positioned with an experienced leadership team that has demonstrated capability in managing through periods of uncertainty.\n\nAnd we will maintain our focus on our customers employees and shareholders.\n\nI am confident that we will further raise our performance when markets recover and look forward to reinstating guidance with some of the uncertainty has subsided.\n\nNow, let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nThank you Jim and good morning, everyone.\n\nHighlights of the second quarter was our strong profitability delivered in the face of global uncertainty our revenues were $8 6 billion down.\n\nDown 2% from a year ago.\n\nSales in North America decreased 6%, while international revenues increased 5%.\n\nEBITDA was $1 $6 billion or 18, 4% sales for the quarter compared to $1 $3 billion or 15, 3% of sales a year ago.\n\nThe higher EBIT.\n\nwas driven by higher power generation demand strong operational efficiencies positive pricing and lower compensation expenses, which were partially offset by lower North America truck volumes and the unfavorable impact of tariffs on all of our operating segments now.\n\nNow I will go into more detail by line item.\n\nGross margin for the quarter was $2 $3 billion or 26, 4% of sales compared to $2 $2 billion or 24, 9% last year.\n\nProved margins were driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in power systems and distribution.\n\nSelling administrative and research expenses were $1 $1 billion of .\n\n, 1% of sales compared to $1 $2 billion or 13, 7% of sales.\n\nLower compensation costs, primarily variable compensation.\n\nBoth gross margin and operating expenses and the financial performance of all operating segments year over year.\n\nJoint venture income of a $118 million increased $15 million from the previous year, primarily driven by higher China volumes within our engine business as demand improved compared to a weak 2024.\n\nOther income increased to $49 million positive compared to a negative $3 million from the prior year driven by the positive impact of foreign currency valuation.\n\nJames on investments related to company owned life insurance.\n\nInterest expense was $87 million, a decrease of $22 million from prior year, primarily driven by lower weighted average interest rates, partially offset by higher debt balances.\n\nThe all in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 24, 2%, including $3 million or two cents per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items.\n\nAll in net earnings for the quarter were $890 million or $6 43.\n\nThe diluted share compared to $726 million or $5 26 per diluted share a year ago.\n\nOperating cash flow was an inflow of $785 million.\n\nCompared to an outflow of $851 million a year ago with the difference mainly driven by the $1 9 billion.\n\nQuiet by the previously disclosed settlement agreements with the REIT regulatory agencies, which flowed out in Q2 last year.\n\nExcluding the settlement operating cash flow was an inflow of $1 $1 billion a year ago.\n\nI will now comment on segment performance.\n\nI'll provide some comments for the remainder of 2025.\n\nThe engine segment first quarter revenues were $2 9 billion, a decrease of 8% from a year ago.\n\nEBITDA was 13, 8% a decrease from 14, 1% a year ago, because we couldnt North American volumes were partially offset by pricing related to the launch data products in light duty markets operational efficiencies and higher joint venture income.\n\nChina.\n\nComponents revenue was $2 7 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago.\n\nEBITDA was 14, 7% compared to 13, 6% of sales a year ago as lower product coverage costs operational efficiencies and pricing more than offset lower on highway demand in North America.\n\nIn the distribution segment revenues increased 7% from a year ago to $3 billion.\n\nEBITDA was a record $445 million and improved as a percentage of sales to $14 six compared to 11, 1% of sales a year ago, driven by higher power generation strong parts demand and overall improvements in gross margin.\n\nIn the power systems segment revenues were $1 $9 billion, an increase of 19% from a year ago.\n\nEBIT dollars were also a record at $443 million.\n\nRising from 810, 9% to 22, 8% of sales driven by strong volume, particularly in data center applications.\n\nAnd the mission critical applications.\n\npricing and our continued focus on productivity and other operational improvements.\n\nAccelerated revenues decreased 5%.\n\n$105 million is increased E mobility sales, mainly to bus customers, partially offset lower electrolyze installations.\n\nOur EBITDA loss was $100 million.\n\nCompared to an EBITDA loss of $117 million, a year ago, reflecting a lower cost base, resulting from the actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nIn summary, we delivered strong profitability to the second quarter.\n\nResult of improved operational execution across our business.\n\nBut more than offset weaker demand in North America truck markets.\n\nFor the first for the third quarter, we expect North America truck demand.\n\nTo sharply declined from second quarter levels as our recent truck orders are at multiyear lows driven by uncertainty due to trade tariffs regulation and caution about the prospects for freight.\n\nSince our last earnings call, we've seen a steady stream of updates from our OEM customers extending the number of production down days through the third quarter.\n\nWe view current order levels is unsustainably low, but immediate catalysts for recovery are not yet clear.\n\nWe have not yet felt.\n\nThe full impact from tariffs and there is still uncertainty about duration and ongoing levels, which was highlighted again last week with the flurry of new announcements.\n\nRemains to be seen what this will impact this will have on business confidence on the demand for capital goods beyond trucks.\n\nWe've worked hard to mitigate the impact of tariffs and while negative to profitability in the second quarter, we should enter the fourth quarter close to our price cost neutral position.\n\nWith regard to tariffs.\n\nAs you saw in our second quarter results come into us in a strong position to navigate through this uncertainty with our industry, leading portfolio of products and our global network, we will place to support our customers.\n\nWhile we expect the coming months to be much more challenging primarily for the engine and components segment. We are staying focused on our strategic priorities. While also taking actions in the short term to reduce costs and lower inventory well.\n\nWe look forward to reinstating our outlook when the economic.\n\nThe picture becomes clearer.\n\nConfident as markets recover we will continue to raise our performance as we are clearly down in the first half of this year. Thanks for joining US today now let me turn it back over to Nick.\n\nThank you Mark out of consideration to others on the call I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow up if you have an additional question. Please rejoin the queue operator, we're ready for our first question.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question. Please press star one on your telephone keypad, a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You May Press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment that may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys as a reminder.\n\nWe do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question.\n\nOur first questions come from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. It seems like you have a little bit of season, a little bit of famine here. So I'll focus on the , yes, that's all right.\n\nPower systems.\n\nLet's talk about power systems.\n\nBig margin there, obviously much higher than I think we expected I know you've been doing a lot of work on this over the past few years John but.\n\nAt the end of the day.\n\nI'm curious if you think that is sort of the right margin level that we should be thinking about as we start modeling forward is that sustainable or was there anything in there that we should be aware of.\n\nYes, Thanks, Steve for the question and really pleased with the performance of the power systems business. As you noted we started a couple years ago on a journey to really improve.\n\nOperational performance.\n\nAnd really coupled with a strong and growing demand in the power generation market has really benefited that business. So we've made many of the steps and really better leveraging the capacity that we have in trying to improve throughput and operational performance and frankly the team has outperformed.\n\nTerms of the efforts for that and that has led to.\n\nReally strong margin improvement that you've seen over the last couple of years.\n\nWe're continuing to focus on.\n\nAreas, where we can improve operational efficiency and performance, we're continuing our investment in doubling the capacity.\n\nIn that business, which we expect to be fully online by the beginning of next year.\n\nSo I think the pace of improvement has probably stabilized, but we will certainly continue to work on operational efficiencies and delivering value to our customers and being able to price for that.\n\nDrive that that mentality across all of our businesses.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd maybe with it.\n\nJust to say there is nothing nothing unique in there other than demand was strong for both generate as I am parts, but theres no one timers in there or anything like that.\n\nOkay understood and then I assume you must have pretty good backlog in that segment. Maybe you can comment on that but do you have pricing flexibility in that backlog. If you need to continue to reprice this stuff if necessary before delivery.\n\nYes, we have.\n\nBacklog out about two years in that business and so you'll continue to see strong demand strong backlog log and we've been working with customers, where we have backlog on the tariff.\n\nRecovery.\n\nAnd made some progress there so.\n\nTypically we're not reprice data beyond that and existing orders that we've taken with pricing and aftermarket as the market moves and as I said working on tariff recovery across all of our businesses.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nHi, there good morning, Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another strong quarter here.\n\nWanted to ask a little bit of a bigger picture sticking to the kind of power systems dynamic back at your Investor Day last year, you cant quantify that total data center I think business was $1 4 billion I think in sales.\n\nAnd then you were kind of 23% of six.\n\n$6 billion global market for data centers.\n\nI think at the time, you also kind of noted that that would be a $2 billion sale.\n\nSales for you in 2026, and maybe a $9 billion market I know.\n\nDifficult to quantify.\n\nIt's a 2020.\n\n630 next year, but I guess could you just comment on that how are you seeing your business growth and demand and market share.\n\nUltimately evolve towards that kind of $2 billion.\n\nTop line and kind of where are we in terms of the size of your business within data centers.\n\nYes. Thanks for the question. So we are continuing to be very well positioned and we think the combination of our products.\n\nWe've launched the central theories has continued to add some products, but the larger larger ones of those are quite popular in data centers, coupled with our distribution.\n\nBusiness provides cummins and advantage of our strong player and a growing backup power provider to data centers.\n\nWe feel like we continue to maintain that position and take advantage of new products and capacity investment.\n\nExpect this year to.\n\nBe pretty stable in the second half with typical seasonality, but as I said, we will have some additional capacity coming on line as we go into 2026.\n\nThat's helpful and I guess is it fair to assume then $2 billion is still kind of the way to think about 'twenty 'twenty six.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay Spring no change in.\n\nInfused he hasnt for demand.\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook with Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nHi, Good morning, I guess, what struck me about the quarter is your margin performance, even with North America truck going through a correction. So I guess the two areas that.\n\nStuck out to me Besides power systems was new distribution margins, which I'm, assuming is getting the benefit of power.\n\nOur margins moving structurally higher there just because of the benefit that you get through from the power system business and then also on the component side, you were able to improve your margins. Despite despite sales declines I think you noted lower product coverage is there any way you could quantify that just trying to think about the implications for margins in the back half and then I.\n\nYes, My second question.\n\nJan just relates to sort of you know what I mean, the cycle like in North America, Obviously, we're seeing a big correction.\n\nIn 2025 lack of pre buy.\n\nBased on what you're hearing from your customers. How are you thinking about North America in 2026 and 2027.\n\nOkay.\n\nJamie I'll start on the margin question. So on distribution, yes, the benefits of power.\n\nBenefits.\n\nYeah strong parts business and then we've got positive pricing in the distribution business as well so all of those have combined.\n\nTo make for very positive results in distribution overall, yes and component it is not reasonable to expect on .\n\nSignificant continuing declines in truck volumes.\n\nWe can maintain margins in the short run we expect obviously margins to improve over the long run and engines and components, but you are right we called out the.\n\nCoverage numbers.\n\nBecause that was a tougher quarter.\n\nA year ago, and a much cleaner quarter just within the components for the company overall, there really wasn't much difference in the product coverage numbers.\n\nWe're in the components segment that was probably worth something like half a point.\n\nSo that was not a one time it was more the absence of a problem from a year ago than something that's special special that happened in this quarter, but just to be clear given the rates of decline in the third quarter from second quarter and engines and components.\n\nWe should expect that theres going to be a negative impact on the profitability of those two segments.\n\nOkay. Thank you and then John just on the cycle.\n\nYeah on the cycle, Jamie it's it's.\n\nThere's a number of typical factors and then some atypical factors that we see influencing the truck cycle. So.\n\nSpot rates continue to be low.\n\nEconomic demand isn't really grown for customers' interest rates are still higher.\n\nAnd while the age of the fleet on average has gone up some.\n\nWe still are seeing that kind of cyclical normal cyclical down in the truck market, which then had it.\n\nOn top of that this uncertainty around tariff.\n\nTariff policy the impact thats going to have on price of truck and regulatory uncertainty, which means customers are really just holding.\n\nWaiting to see what happens get more stability and clarity on orders.\n\nAnd in Q2 build rates held up okay. We saw some softening that as Mark noted, we're seeing a lot more down days and our customers and us restructuring.\n\nAnd our plant in anticipation of a much weaker.\n\nQ3, how long will last.\n\nIs a little bit hard to predict the optimists the optimistic.\n\nJen would say, we get more tariff clarity and stability in Q3 and.\n\nMore certainty on regulation, we still believe today that we will have 27, Nox regulation and if we do then that will likely drive.\n\nback up.\n\nBut it's uncertain right now we're working closely with EPA is to try to push for clarity.\n\nI'll help them understand levers that they may have to reduce the total cost impact of that in particular longer emissions warranty, but it's really hard for me to predict so the pessimist says it drags out longer and Thats part of why we're not giving guidance as it's just really difficult to predict and the pessimist next door.\n\nPointed out.\n\nMore use the not Q4 is not particularly strong into Q3, so we hoping for that.\n\nThat would definitely help all industry participants, but we need to see a significant change in the momentum the momentum for orders tools.\n\nFor engine systems is down obviously clearly do.\n\nThank you our next questions come from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nWe lost Rob Rob.\n\nRob could you please check if yourself muted.\n\nBeg your pardon.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nYou guys just touched on the engine margins Mark I'd say.\n\nAnd your comments on where things have to go given given volumes, but this quarter was pretty good last quarter was great and I wondered if you might comment on price that might influence that or anything else given.\n\nShallow margin decline on lower revenues and engines and Jim just touched on hundred 27, I Wonder if you have any guess as to what we have at least clarity on what the resolution will be thank you.\n\nYes, so a couple of factors on the engine margin wed.\n\nCalled out in .\n\nNear quarters, because it's been a running theme.\n\nAs we've launched new models in the light duty segment, we have raised prices.\n\nProduct quality has been very.\n\nStable positive and then China I don't want to get people over excited on China.\n\nA little bit from.\n\nWeaker levels now the engine business.\n\nBenefits.\n\nNot from the joint venture earnings in China, which are a little bit higher so all those factors and then when we say strong parts that's flowing through the engine business in power systems generally so all of those were.\n\nFactors that the pricing primarily on new engines was around light duty.\n\nI'll just add we have not.\n\nThe focus the focus on operational efficiency come in through a couple of years, we have a lot of supply disruption in high demand we've had Ah.\n\nfocus on really just improving the fundamentals of how our business operates and how our plants operate and then we did do some targeted restructuring last year.\n\nTwo.\n\nOptimize how our business operates.\n\nTook advantage of.\n\nThe softening that we started to see last year to do that so you are seeing some benefit of that across the company as well.\n\nOkay. Thank you Jennifer I'm talking about.\n\nYoure welcome.\n\nThank you our next questions come from the line of Tim Thein with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThank you and good morning.\n\nFirst question was on the power Gen business and.\n\nAnd I guess more domestically this kind of speed the power theme is gaining a lot of.\n\nMomentum and traction in terms of the operators that want to get out.\n\nGood power.\n\nAccess quickly.\n\nJust given the long lead times.\n\nIndustrial gas turbines.\n\nIt seems like Youre, starting to see and hear a little bit more of operators that are looking to leverage research as a way to kind of gain off grid primary power and I'm. Just curious if that's something that Cummins has seen or expecting.\n\nExpecting to see maybe just a comment on that.\n\nYes, I mean, I think the trend certainly is need for more power challenges of getting that power today, we are still primarily positioned in backup.\n\nPower certainly strategically we're looking at where we want to position ourselves for the future is that that demand for power continues to exist, but it's not.\n\nAre they meaningfully impacting our business today.\n\nOr in the near future.\n\nOkay, Alright, understood and then just on distribution.\n\nI can remember years ago, when double digits was talked about as kind of the aspirational target there.\n\nI'm just curious as the power Gen business, obviously has been growing for some time.\n\nThey're more just as that as the power demands increase and maybe the data centers are.\n\nWe're consuming more and more power is that bringing along more services and more kind of.\n\nAncillary type revenues with those installations, such that that business carries higher margins or would that all be.\n\nCollected in power systems margins I'm just curious.\n\nThe.\n\nThe parts part of distribution as a percentage has continued to decline, which I would think would be.\n\nDilutive to the margin so maybe just to comment on that would be helpful. Thank you. So I think I think.\n\nYes, you are right any of those services and other things would show in distribution not in power systems.\n\nWhat lies beneath the surface a little bit Tim is just a more broad based improvement in our international.\n\nOperations I do also remember vividly those double digit margin targets when we set them.\n\nThere has been dramatic improvements in area like Africa, where we had high growth aspirations it quite frankly.\n\nAt some risk management issues and execution issues early on.\n\nThose are long behind us so I think we've really.\n\nMore broadly improve the operational effectiveness.\n\nability focus.\n\nOutside North America. In addition to improving North America. So I think it's a mall or a small broad based.\n\nPhenomena, that's really driven the results.\n\nBut typically in the power generation market if were doing backup power then there's minimal aftermarket parts demand, but the distribution business can do additional content on the installation of benefits from that work with the customer.\n\nThank you. Our next question is come from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nHi, Thank you I know you don't want to give guidance, but I am curious just directly to ask.\n\nThe EBITDA margin for engine and third quarter fourth quarter. How are you thinking about that relative to you know we've been above 13% now for a while havent been below $12 11.\n\nPercent since late 2021.\n\nAnd you mentioned the JV income, maybe a little bit better as an offset it is obviously more impactful to lower the consolidated revenues are just because people are going to look at sort of a thought process of a bottoming truck.\n\nIn the next few quarters when it comes to margins and then sort of go from there on how to think about 26 earnings can you give us any quantification.\n\nHow to think about the EBITDA margins in engines in the third quarter back half of 'twenty four 'twenty five thank you.\n\nYes, we spend a lot of times as you can imagine.\n\n.\n\nWhat I would say is I don't see a lot of momentum China's improved off a very.\n\nReport them, but we're going to come under pressure here in the second half what I'd say is whilst the margins are going to go down clearly there's nothing structural about that were just the volumes are going to go down significantly I think if we looked on a full year basis.\n\nMight see Theres no reason to see why the Decrementals.\n\nVery different on a full year basis from prior cycles, but clearly for engines and components, they're going to come under significant pressure and just.\n\nJust to give a bit more technical not to be negative just to give it back.\n\nWe already know how many engines, we produced in heavy and medium duty truck in July we can see the order build rate for August.\n\nIt's going to be very depressed as Jen said down 25% to 30%.\n\nNot surprising given how low the orders, but I think as we look forward.\n\nWe're confident.\n\nThat we.\n\nMargins will rebound quickly as the volume comes through.\n\nThe yoga complexity that we're dealing with is the lack of clarity on the emissions regulations means we've got to.\n\nRetain flexibility on the engineering side.\n\nAnd we said at our last analyst day over time, we expect engineering to come down as a percent of sales in engines and components.\n\nWe're not able to execute that.\n\nSide of it yet.\n\nBecause of.\n\nThis lingering uncertainty so clear reduction, but nothing structural no significant changes to market pricing, which up.\n\nAlways could have an impact structurally so we're going to go down and then we're going to rebound in those two businesses and hopefully quicker rather than later history says, we don't have that many quarters of down.\n\nA few quarters and already but we're waiting for a momentum on the order side, yes, we're going to be tough.\n\nUntil the second half.\n\nThe incremental margins. So again, I don't I know youre, avoiding quantifying, but just so we can frame this a little bit.\n\nThe idea of the decremental margins and the EBITDA for.\n\nengines.\n\nFor the third quarter, it's at 35 ish.\n\n40% kind of range, we're just trying to get some sense of how theyre going to be.\n\nWe're going to be pretty heavy.\n\nI'm not trying to hide from it they're going to be pretty heavy visa. These.\n\nThese are some of the largest declines we've seen if you look at the orders in the past three or four months.\n\nThey are amongst the weakest three or four month periods. We've had in the last 20 years, that's going to show up in our numbers.\n\nBut it is going to be.\n\nIt's a cyclical business and it will rebound.\n\nJust to reinforce.\n\nIt's going to be tough, but then when the volumes come back, which they inevitably will when we cant say, we'd expect performance to rebound as well.\n\nSo hopefully.\n\nJuly is the trough, we started with a spreadsheet imagine a spreadsheet in front of you still.\n\nStill old spreadsheets.\n\nWhere we've got customer down days bye.\n\nBrand by location and when we sat here.\n\nThree months ago it was modest.\n\nFor the third quarter and now it's kind of a sea of Red.\n\nBut we'll come through this period, but the margins will come under pressure, we're not going to hide from that but there is nothing structural change and that's what I want investors to leave if there was something structural we would tell you that it's going to be volume based.\n\nAnd it's going to be tough the good news is we've got two businesses that are performing at record levels, where demand is high and that's what we look for.\n\nAnd stronger than they have done in prior cycles.\n\nAnd we expect broadly demand for those businesses to remain stable for the remainder of the year. So I hope that helps a bit I know it's tough the reason why we haven't given guidance is.\n\nAs you can see we withdrew guidance it was nothing to do with our performance in the second quarter, but the number of variables out there.\n\nEssentially remain the same from three months ago, Yes, we've got more visibility into Q3, and it's much worse than we would have imagined at the start of the year. It's worse than we would have imagined three months ago, but we hope this is the bottoming period.\n\nWe're moving on and hopefully hopefully the industry set up for a better 2026, and we are well positioned with a strong position in the markets good relationships with excellent customers.\n\nSo we look forward to that but this is going to be one of those tougher periods.\n\nThank you our next questions come from the line of Kyle with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nThank you I was hoping mark if you could just touch on your thoughts on capital allocation quickly.\n\nHow are you thinking about leverage at current levels appetite for share buybacks.\n\nAnd then.\n\nThank you you guys should be beneficiaries from the big Beautiful Bill.\n\nFavorable cash taxes interest.\n\nHave you tried to quantify that impact and thoughts on where you might deploy that excess cash too.\n\nYes so.\n\nYeah.\n\nPretty long track record of returning capital to shareholders. We said kind of this long term benchmark at least 50% and we've been living up to that even during a period, where we made a major acquisition.\n\nYou saw we had a healthy increase in the dividend to you we've been working hard to improve our .\n\nOur leverage metrics and I feel good about where they are now.\n\nSo really.\n\nThe pace of capital allocation is really based on economy.\n\nProspects for the business.\n\nWhen we do capital allocation, we'll also looking at making sure we do in the most effective way that we can.\n\nSo yes incrementally we should be looking for more of that going forwards.\n\nBase case.\n\nYes, if the taxes are the beautiful part than the tariffs are definitely not right and the challenges that the tariff costs have created great uncertainty I'll, just say a little bit about tariffs since I haven't been asked about that yet.\n\nThe cost of the tariffs to Cummins and I'll quantify the tax benefits in a moment.\n\nMultiples.\n\nThe tax benefit.\n\nFull forward of tax benefits that are allowed under accelerated depreciation and whilst we've done a pretty good job in mitigating tariffs.\n\nIt's placing a significant burden on the industries and all the participants that we played on so all that weighs into all of this calculus of liquidity capital allocation.\n\nTo answer you specifically on the.\n\nTax Bill I mean, we've got some choices to make and what elections, we want to make.\n\nThrough the various dynamics of tax legislation, you could reasonably expect a $125 million to $250 million of.\n\nCash benefit, but we haven't we will finalize our choices.\n\nIn the third quarter in Texas inherently some strange tradeoffs were cash benefits today can be negative for long term tax rates and then we have quite a relatively complex scope globally.\n\nI think all of that through so I would say.\n\nOn the margin could that be like 5% to 8% of our operating cash flow for the year, yes.\n\nThe monthly change any of our business plans for this you know we've invested a lot in North America to meet the upcoming emissions regulations and quite frankly, we're looking for some clarity to be able to deploy that capital.\n\nwith our new products going forward. So we're not rushing to spend more capital here, we're hoping for clarity on it.\n\nUtilizing the Catholic weakness, so sorry for the long.\n\nLittle bit of wining, there, but just to reinforce the complexity.\n\nYes.\n\nThat's helpful. And then just as it sounds like you're you're only expecting to completely offset tariff impacts.\n\nAnd then pass through to the customer you commented a little bit on how the industry is handling it.\n\nBut maybe you could just expand on just what you're seeing and hearing from the customers and markets and how they're handling that pass through.\n\nOf the tariff costs and that is the plan still to rollout the EPA twenty-seven compliant engine in 2006.\n\nThat'll be additional pricing on that so just I guess would love to hear your thoughts on how youre thinking about that and the industry's ability to handle even more pricing. Thank you.\n\nSo tariffs with negative to profitability for Cummins in the second quarter. So we had.\n\nWe did not fully recover.\n\nWe are approximately.\n\n$22 million negative net in the quarter.\n\nWe've been working hard to mitigate the costs through.\n\nManaging when we're buying materials, where we're buying it from Resourcing, where we can.\n\nWe've done a lot as you can imagine making choices about supply chain is hard when the international tariff dynamic keeps changing so it's hard to make any.\n\nDecisions to shift when you're not sure that we've reached a period of stability so about $22 million negative as we said three months ago.\n\nWe did not expect the full impact until the second half of the year. That's the case.\n\nSo both the cost to Cummins and the degree of recoveries will be increasing in subsequent quarters, we expect to enter Q4.\n\nOn a much closer to .\n\ncost neutral on tariffs.\n\nStarting in the fourth quarter, but there is a gap in Q2 will be again in Q3 Q4, we'll get close but it's hard to underestimate the amount of resources and time that this is consumed amongst.\n\nAll industry participants.\n\nIt is I do believe we don't know exactly what we end user prices are but.\n\nBut we do know that everybody's suffering with this it doesn't help at a time when truck orders in particular had already been slowing.\n\nMaybe more than you wanted to move on quickly from a very.\n\nYes uncomfortable topic here.\n\nAnd on the product launches. So the regulations are still in place today, we are continuing to work towards launching and we have our new platforms of course, the harm engine platforms launching.\n\nAs a part of the 27 regulations, we no longer are launching the F 15 earlier in the year. So at the end of next year, we'll be launching those new platforms.\n\nTo comply with the 27 regulation and.\n\nContinuing to keep the team focused on that just as a reminder, those engines are all made in the U S and we're investing $1 billion.\n\nIn our engine plants.\n\nPrimarily because of the new platforms, which we believe will really position us with the most efficient highest power density.\n\nBest products in the market.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tami Zakaria with Jpmorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHey, good morning, Thank you so much.\n\nYet one more question on par system.\n\nShould we expect.\n\nBetter cost absorption and improved incremental margin versus what we are seeing now when the remaining capacity.\n\nJuly of next year.\n\nThe premise of the question is whether Youre currently seeing some inefficiencies that youre building capacity and firing on all cylinders against the robust demand and so whether incremental margin could get even better once the new capacity is live and running at full rate. So if you could comment on that.\n\nOkay perfectly reasonable question.\n\nIt makes the assumption that so many things are standing still right I mean this is all.\n\nIt was $1 million and one things going on but if you ask us do we have aspirations for the power systems margins over time to go yes.\n\nYes, we do right and yes, when capacities fully installed and the demand still usually that's better.\n\nThere's a lot of variation we don't just make one engine in one facility loaded differences by end market and region.\n\nBut just to be clear do we expect over time.\n\nWhats been nice to see this consistency now with higher performance quarter on quarter, Yes, We're still we still think there's plenty of things to work on to.\n\nTo take it we don't expect.\n\nChanges for the remainder of this year revenue should be relatively range bound.\n\nBut as we go forward, yes, after absorbing investments, we'd hope to do better all other things being equal.\n\nGreat. Thank you that's all ahead.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question is come from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nThanks. Good morning, just wanted to start on power. Gen. You mentioned that you have backlog out two years I'm, assuming that's for the largest engine.\n\nJust curious what the what the lead times are on some of those.\n\nAnd obviously you have the capacity coming online fully next year.\n\nHow does that affect the lead times that you see there.\n\nYes. So obviously as we were taking orders were considering the incremental capacity that will have comment on online next year.\n\nSo we are taking orders out in the 2007 timeframe now from our customers. If we have any movement in terms of current order.\n\nBacklog in order demand, we reallocate those slots and we work with our customers to do that but.\n\nYou want and particularly the larger engine orders today.\n\nIm happy to put you in the queue and 27 for that.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd then sorry to two.\n\nI ask a follow up on the uncomfortable topic, but.\n\nIn terms of the Q4 tariffs.\n\nYou mentioned that you expect to kind of be price versus cost neutral there.\n\nCustomers is that sort of just contractually what you have embedded in these in these new agreements or is there a negotiation that has to happen there.\n\nJust curious how how that.\n\nShould play out.\n\nIt is not contractual in most cases, we have been actively negotiating with our customers on tariff.\n\nRecovery timeline.\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer Company. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nThanks wanted to tie together a couple of points you mentioned earlier I think mark you.\n\nHighlighted that.\n\nMaybe engineering spend intensity.\n\nIs is being negatively impacted by the uncertainty around the rigs and then.\n\nJohn You mentioned.\n\nSo some actual launch push outs.\n\nCan you help us understand.\n\nOperationally, how your engineering and technology strategy are being affected at this moment.\n\nAre you doing redundant or duplicative engineering development for a variety of outcomes.\n\nJust trying to get a better handle on how you are now.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo the majority of the work we're doing is focused on these new product launches.\n\nAnd so you've got a peak of investment in research and development as well as capital a lot of it going and ahead of that launch at the end of next year.\n\nAnd we did delay by six months one of the product launches because frankly, the uncertainty around regulation and Tara screening.\n\nIn an environment, where even though it was a more efficient product that we thought could bring some value to customers.\n\nDemand for the content.\n\nWe've delayed that that then extend some of the R&D for that program. We are of course doing some additional work on contingency plans at a much lower level, while keeping the team focused on that.\n\nLaunches that we have.\n\nWe get into 2017, and then we anticipate following that.\n\nLevel of R&D and capital investment engine business.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay. Great. So 2017 is really when we start to see some signs of some leverage there.\n\nAnd then quickly.\n\nQuickly shifting gears to two power.\n\nAs you mentioned in your content is primarily today.\n\nAround the backup Gen set with.\n\nWith the shift towards one side direct power you have an entire division.\n\nThat can do.\n\nBattery backup.\n\nAnd fuel cell power, you're obviously very familiar with natural gas generation.\n\nAnd you've talked in the past, including at Investor Day about micro grids.\n\nGive us any color on .\n\nTrends in wallet share expansion with the datacenter customers and if youre seeing that where it's coming from.\n\nSo we have launched.\n\nYear.\n\nHey, Sherri energy storage product in the market, we have some limited offerings I would say today in Nash.\n\nNatural gas and.\n\nEnergy storage and that's an area that we are continuing to evaluate our position in the products that we have in our portfolio and over time, how we might want to participate NFS an area, we want to expand so no no firm decisions or anything to give guidance on today, but that certainly is an area that could be interesting for comments and microgrid space.\n\nGiven the growing demand for power and the challenges for.\n\nOur customers.\n\nTo meet that.\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nHi, good morning, guys.\n\nSo you commented about tariff or the price cost being neutral five that's fourth quarter. I was just wondering whether that's true on a second by second basis or is the bias towards one versus the other.\n\nAnd then secondly.\n\nWhat was price cost in and if you can share any thoughts on what it should look like in this quarter that'd be helpful. Thank you.\n\nYes, I think.\n\nYes, it's a challenge in all segments of our business, what I would say for tariffs.\n\nWith the engine business and components probably.\n\nAbsorbing more than the rest of the company, but not not dramatically different.\n\nPrice cost overall.\n\nWhen we weigh in.\n\nThe actions that we've taken on past reactions that we've taken on light duty engines some of the improvements in power systems I ignore.\n\nIf I ignore tariffs than we were about.\n\n.\n\nWe were about one two.\n\n2% improvement overall across all the businesses remembering thats, a big step up in power systems and distribution in particular.\n\nGot it that's helpful.\n\nThe EBIT business in components margins.\n\nWere down or flat.\n\nOkay product coverage.\n\nGroup.\n\nAnd.\n\nSecondly, just on .\n\nJust recognizing that we're in I guess.\n\nRegime, when it comes to like alternative powertrains.\n\nI guess, how are you thinking about.\n\nGrowth trajectory.\n\nI'm thinking maybe more solid on the electrical side.\n\nAnd then like the path towards.\n\nFor long term profit targets that you've set out how has that changed.\n\nYes.\n\nIt's fair to say that trajectory of growth in that business as you have seen us growing in reducing losses, we did a reset.",
    "content2": "Construction at the end of last year to try to focus on the areas the technologies and products that we think.\n\nWe will grow.\n\nAnd I do think it positions comment as well because we're continuing to of course offer engine based solution startups are not surviving in many of our OEM customers.\n\nDon't really want to invest given the uncertainties that we're really trying to position ourselves to pace of investment.\n\nBeing able to.\n\nBe that provider as the market starts to develop we're continuing to move forward with our.\n\nOur partners in the amplify sell joint venture here in the U S commercial vehicle Sal and pacing investment does that take.\n\nGathering as well so it's slowing.\n\nBut we're committed to continue to reduce losses over time and grow as the.\n\nAs the market grows in the meantime, we'll sell some more engines, which will be positive for .\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you we have reached the end of our question and answer session I would now like to turn the floor back over to Nick for closing comments.\n\nThank you that concludes our teleconference for today.

[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2025.\nParticipating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation is available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from our press release and earnings material, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter, led by record performance in our Power Systems segment. We are entering unchartered territory as the trade tariffs start to have a more significant impact beginning in the second quarter. The breadth and changing nature of the tariffs have introduced a great degree of uncertainty and mean that at this time, we are unable to predict with confidence our expected performance for the year.\nIt is important to note that we serve many different end markets, some with long backlogs and clear secular themes in our Power Systems business, some less sensitive to short-term economic sentiment such as our Aftermarket business and other markets where customers tend to flex demand more quickly when business confidence weakens. The duration of uncertainty and extent of tariffs will influence how much and for how long demand is impacted.\nCummins is in a strong position, strategically and financially, with an experienced leadership team, well-versed in navigating through periods of uncertainty. We look forward to restoring our guidance when we have more stability in the outlook.\nNow I will move on to some of our highlights from our first quarter. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will then provide an update on how uncertainties in our current environment may impact our end markets. Mark will then take you through more details of our first quarter financial performance.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to make progress in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy. In our Engine segment, we introduced the much anticipated X10 as a part of our Cummins HELM platforms. This engine replaces both the L9 and X12 engine platforms and will deliver a new level of performance, durability and efficiency for heavy and medium-duty customers. Alongside the X15 and B Series, the X10 provides customers with the power solution to meet their unique operational requirements while maintaining the performance and reliability for which Cummins is known.\nIn addition, we unveiled the new Cummins B7.2 diesel engine that brings the latest technology and advancements to 1 our most proven platforms. The new engine will feature a slightly higher displacement and is designed to be a global platform, which creates flexibility for different applications and duty cycles. Both the B7.2 and X10 engines will be manufactured at Rocky Mount Engine Plant in North Carolina and will go into production in North America in 2027.\nIn our Power Systems segment, we announced the acquisition of assets of First Mode, a leader in retrofit hybrid solutions for mining and rail operations. This technology represents the first commercially available retrofit hybrid system for mining equipment, significantly reducing total cost of ownership while advancing decarbonization and operations. This acquisition reinforces Cummins' commitment to providing innovative and effective decarbonization solutions while meeting the needs of our customers on their transition to a lower carbon future.\nLastly, our Accelera by Cummins segment announced a supply of 100 megawatts proton exchange membrane or PEM electrolyzer system for bp's Lingen green hydrogen project in Germany. The hydrogen generation system will be the largest electrolyzer system assembled by Accelera to date and will be manufactured in Accelera new electrolyzer plant in Spain. Once fully commissioned in 2027, the 100-megawatt electrolyzer system will produce up to 11,000 tons of green hydrogen per year.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2025 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, offset by softening in the North America truck market. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.2 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2024. EBITDA was $1.5 billion or 17.9% compared with $2.6 billion or 30.6% a year ago.\nFirst quarter 2024 results included a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as restructuring expenses, EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2024. This improvement in profitability was driven by the benefit of higher power generation and aftermarket volumes, pricing and operational efficiency, which more than exceeded the impact of lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus.\nFor our Power Systems business, in particular, we had record performance in both EBITDA dollars and percentage in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from operational improvements and strong end markets.\nOur first quarter revenues in North America decreased by 1% compared to 2024. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks for the first quarter was 63,000 units, down 18% from 2024 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were down 21,000 or 21% from 2024.\nIndustry production of medium-duty trucks was 32,000 units in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 21%, while our unit sales were 31,000, down 14% from 2024. We shipped 29,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their [indiscernible] pickups in the first quarter of 2025, down 25% from 2024 level. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 12%, driven primarily by continued strong data center demand.\nOur international revenues decreased by 5% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.8 billion, an increase of 9% as accelerating data center demand and high domestic infrastructure demand more than offset lower export demand.\nIndustry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 294,000 units, a decrease of 4% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were $42,000, an increase of 6%.\nIndustry demand for excavators in China in the first quarter were 61,000 units, an increase of 23% from 2024 levels. Our units sold were 11,000, an increase of 19%. The increase in the China market size is primarily due to domestic cyclical replacement demand, world development and farmland renovation demand. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 68% in the first quarter due to accelerated data center demand.\nFirst quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $725 million, a decrease of 14% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production was flat with 2024. Power generation revenues decreased by 11% in the first quarter as the prior year included a prebuy ahead of emissions regulations change.\nTo summarize, we achieved impressive results in the first quarter with record financial performance in our Power Systems business. Looking ahead, there's heightened uncertainty about the pace of growth in the global economy due to tariffs, which could negatively impact demand for capital goods. Absent more clarity about the likely duration of elevated tariffs, we are not able to provide a reliable forecast for the remainder of this year.\nAs a large U.S. headquartered company with significant manufacturing in the U.S., we appreciate the administration support for American manufacturing. This support is crucial as we invest more than $1 billion in our Engine and Power Systems manufacturing operations in the U.S. over the next few years, employing people in nearly every state through our manufacturing plants and sales and service branches.\nAs we evaluate our current manufacturing footprint and our exposure to tariff regulations, we believe we are well positioned because we primarily produce engines and gensets in the markets where we sell them. For instance, our medium-duty, heavy-duty and high horsepower engines as well as power generation products for U.S. customers are manufactured in our plants located in Indiana, North Carolina, New York and Minnesota. However, like much of our industry, our component and supplier manufacturing will be affected by current tariff regulations, which could disrupt the global economy and ultimately lead to higher costs for consumers.\nIn addition to trade and economic uncertainty, there is also uncertainty in North America emissions regulations for 2027. We continue to expect new NOx regulation to go in place in 2027 and are focused on launching our products on schedule, while also working with the administration as they explore options to lower the cost of existing regulations.\nWhile we believe our product plan is well positioned, the uncertainty in regulations, along with economic uncertainties, have led to a weaker-than-anticipated recent order and also has made pre-buy for the second half of the year unlikely.\nIn summary, we had a strong first quarter and continued our progress in improving EBITDA margins as we shared in our Analyst Day almost a year ago, with tariffs not a significant factor in our results. The economic environment has changed significantly over the past 3 months. We have an experienced leadership team that has demonstrated capability and managing through periods of uncertainty. And we will maintain focus on our customers, our employees and shareholders. We enter this period of heightened uncertainty in a position of strength and look forward to reinstating our guidance when some of the uncertainty has subsided.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong revenue and profitability in the first quarter. First quarter revenues were $8.2 billion, down 3% from a year ago.\nSales in North America decreased 1%, while international revenues declined 5%.\nThe separation of Atmus in mid-March in the prior year resulted in year-over-year sales decline of around 4% to the total consolidated sales, meaning that we were close to flat on an underlying basis.\nEBITDA was $1.5 billion or 17.9% of sales for the quarter compared to $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales a year ago, which, of course, included a onetime gain on the divestiture of the Atmus business of $1.3 billion net of transaction costs. Also a year ago, we incurred $29 million of restructuring expenses.\nTo provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to the prior year, I'm excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses in my following comments.\nEBITDA was $1.5 billion or 17.9% of sales for the quarter compared to adjusted $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales a year ago. The higher EBITDA was driven by higher power generation and aftermarket volumes, positive price cost driven by operational improvements, partially offset by lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus.\nNow let's look at each line item a little more. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 26.4% of sales, up from $2.1 billion or 24.5% last year. The improved margins were driven by favorable pricing, higher aftermarket and operational improvements, especially in Power Systems.\nSelling, administrative and research expenses were $1.1 billion or 13.6% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales a year ago.\nJoint venture income of $131 million increased $8 million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher technology fees within our Engine business and higher volumes in our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within Power Systems.\nOther income was $23 million compared to $21 million from the prior year as gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance more than offset the negative impact of foreign currency revaluation.\nInterest expense was $77 million, a decrease of $12 million from the prior year, primarily driven by a lower average debt balance as a result of the separation of Atmus and lower weighted average interest rates.\nThe all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.9%, including $7 million or $0.05 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items.\nAll in, net earnings for the quarter were $824 million or $5.96 per diluted share compared to $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share a year ago, which includes the net gain on the separation of Atmus, which was $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share, restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per diluted share. And hopefully, we've now lapped all of those exclusions and adjustments and look forward to having less words around those in future quarters.\nAll-in, operating cash flow was an outflow of $3 million compared to an inflow of $276 million a year ago, primarily driven by higher working capital.\nNow let me comment a little more on segment performance. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 16.5%, up from 14.1% a year even on the lower truck volumes. The Engine business benefited from pricing related to the launch of updated products in our light-duty segment, stronger aftermarket volumes, operational efficiencies, good cost control and a modest increase in joint venture income.\nComponents segment revenue was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 20%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, decreased to 14.3% from 14.8% a year ago as lower on-highway demand in North America and Europe and the dilutive impact of the Atmus separation were partially offset by the benefit from operational efficiencies.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to $2.9 billion. EBITDA also increased as a percent of sales to 12.9% compared to 11.6% of sales a year ago, driven by higher power generation volumes, higher aftermarket and favorable pricing.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 19% and EBITDA was a record, increasing from 17.1% to 23.6% sales driven by strong volume, particularly in data center applications and rebuilds, favorable pricing and continued focus on operational improvement.\nAccelera revenues increased 11% to $103 million, driven by increased e-mobility sales and electrolyzer installations arising from prior period orders. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $101 million a year ago as we lowered costs in existing operations, partially offset by additional losses in the Amplify Cell joint venture as it advances its operations.\nIn summary, we delivered impressive profitability for the first quarter even as demand in North America truck markets declined. Uncertainty has increased due to trade tariffs resulting in a slowdown in the global movement of goods, particularly between China and the U.S. It remains to be seen how long the tariffs remain in place and the impact that they have on business confidence and the demand for capital goods.\nCummins is in a strong financial position to navigate through uncertainty with our industry-leading portfolio of products and our global network, we are well placed to support our customers. We look forward to reinstating our outlook when the economic conditions become clearer, along with, hopefully, a return to growth and greater prosperity here in the U.S. and in the global economy.\nIn the meantime, we'll continue to focus on areas we can control, in managing costs and optimizing working capital while meeting our customer commitments. We'll stay focused on our strategic priorities in what is likely to be a more complex operating environment in the coming months as the full impact of the current tariff levels has not yet been felt in our opinion.\nI want to close my prepared remarks by thanking Chris Clulow for his leadership in Investor Relations. He's moving to a new finance leadership role in operations and supply chain and will remain a key adviser to me and our business leaders as we navigate through the current challenges.\nCongratulations to [ Nick Aarons ] in assuming the Investor Relations role. Nick and I look forward to meeting with investors and analysts in person in the coming weeks and months. We're very fortunate to have such a strong finance team at Cummins.\nNow let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.",

Q4 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining us today are Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey; Vice President and CFO, Mark Smith; and Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.\nMore information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to start us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of 2024, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2025. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year.\nAs I reflect back on 2024, I am pleased to share that we delivered strong financial results with records in several parts of the business while also making significant progress in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy. I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders, and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on advancing our strategy and executing our financial commitments as we lead the energy transition.\nIt continues to be clear that our multi-solution Destination Zero strategy that leverages advancements and solutions from both our core and Accelera by Cummins businesses will continue to position us to succeed. We demonstrated this in 2024 as we further strengthened our position through evolving our portfolio and expanding and establishing relationships with new and long-standing key stakeholders and partners.\nMost notably for our core business in 2024, we introduced the Cummins HELM engine platform. Applied across Cummins' legendary B, X10, and X15 Series engine portfolios, the HELM platforms provide customers with the option to choose the fuel type, either advanced diesel or alternate fuels like natural gas and hydrogen, that best suits their business needs and offers the power and performance customers expect while also reducing emissions. Cummins began full production of the X15N natural gas engine at the Jamestown engine plant earlier this year. And we are actively engaged with some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets as they look to reduce their carbon footprint.\nAdditionally, in our core business, we introduced 4 new generator sets to the award-winning Centum series, 2 each powered by Cummins' QSK50 and QSK78 engines. In response to high market demand, these new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers. In order to further raise our capacity to meet rising power generation demand, we also intend to invest $200 million across our U.S., England, and India manufacturing sites. As you will see in our full year financial performance details and 2025 guidance, we are excited about the continued impressive performance and growth potential for our Power Systems business.\nCummins also successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. The separation of Atmus resulted in the tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins' shares outstanding by approximately $5.6 million in the first quarter.\nIn our Accelera business, we completed the formation of our joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies with Daimler Trucks & Buses, PACCAR, and EVE Energy to localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. This strategic collaboration will advance zero emissions technology for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. Amplify began construction this year of a 21-gigawatt hour factory in Mississippi with potential for future expansion as demand grows and is targeting start of production in 2027.\nLastly, as we navigate this long and messy transition for our customers, we remain committed to pacing and refocusing our investments on the most promising paths as the adoption of zero-emission solutions slows in some regions around the world. As you can see in our fourth quarter results, we recorded charges related to the reorganization of our Accelera business segment as we underwent a strategic review to streamline the business while also ensuring we are set up for long-term success. We remain committed to Accelera and its mission, and this business continues to play an important role in our Destination Zero strategy.\nNow I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions, offsetting the softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market. Revenues for the quarter totaled $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2023 as lower North America heavy-duty and pickup truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus were partially offset by continued high demand in our global power generation markets, stronger aftermarket, and North America medium-duty truck volumes as well as improved pricing.\nEBITDA was $1 billion or 12.1% compared to a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2024 results included $312 million of charges related to the strategic reorganization of our Accelera business segment. This compares to the fourth quarter 2023 results, which included $2 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to our voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.8% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.4% a year ago.\nEBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volume, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. 2024 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, essentially flat with 2023 despite the decline in North America heavy-duty truck demand in the second half of the year and reduction of sales from the Atmus separation. EBITDA was a record $6.3 billion or 18.6% of sales compared to $3 billion or 8.9% of sales in 2023.\n2024 results include a gain, net of transaction costs and other expenses, of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture, $312 million of charges related to the Accelera reorganization, and $29 million of first quarter restructuring expenses. This compares to the 2023 results that included $2 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $100 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million of costs related to the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.4 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2024 compared to $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded lower second half North America truck volumes and the reduction in margin from the Atmus separation.\nEBITDA dollars were a record in Power Systems, Distribution, and Engine segments. Our Power Systems business, in particular, finished 2024 with a record full year EBITDA of 18.4% of sales, up from 14.7% in 2023. I'm very pleased with the performance across our core business segments, and you will see from our guidance that we are excited to continue to build on this momentum.\nNow let me provide our overall outlook for 2025 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2025 to be down 2% to up 3% compared to 2024, and EBITDA to be 16.2% to 17.2% of sales, up from 15.7% in 2024. While we expect weaker first half demand in our North America on-highway truck markets, we expect many of our markets, particularly power generation to remain strong throughout the year. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 290,000 units in 2025, flat to down 10% year-over-year. We anticipate weaker first half demand. And while we do expect a prebuy in the second half of the year, the uncertainty on the exact timing and extent is driving our wider guidance range.\nIn the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 140,000 to 155,000 units, down 5% to 15% compared to 2024, primarily driven by weaker-than-expected recent net orders and a depleting backlog. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 130,000 to 140,000 in 2025, flat to up 5% year-over-year. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 5% in 2025. We are projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand in China.\nWhile export demand is expected to decline slightly, we are hopeful that the recent NS4 scrapping policy and other stimulus actions may lead to domestic demand growth. We have not, however, seen a meaningful recovery thus far. While there is still uncertainty around the China truck market for 2025, we expect strength in other markets, particularly power generation, where demand is expected to remain high as data center momentum continues.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint venture to increase 10% in 2024, primarily driven by stronger power generation demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect flat to down 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2025. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5% to 15%, driven by continued high demand in the data center market.\nSales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%. For aftermarket, we expect revenue improvement with a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2025. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million compared to $414 million in 2024. In summary, 2024 was a record year for revenues, net income, EBITDA, and earnings per share.\nIn 2025, we anticipate that demand will be slightly weaker in the North America on-highway truck markets, particularly in the first half of the year but offset by continued strength in the power generation market and resiliency in our Distribution business, given our strong aftermarket presence. Despite a relatively flat revenue forecast, we are expecting to improve profitability and cash flow. We remain committed to our multi-solution approach that is proving to be the right strategy for our customers, for the environment, and for the continued growth of Cummins while also returning cash to investors. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong operational results in the fourth quarter, which resulted in revenue achieving the top end of our prior guidance and EBITDA margins exceeding our projections. 2024 was a record year for revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share, reflecting the strong demand for our products and the strong hard work of our employees.\nNow let me go into more details on Q4 and the full year performance. There were some notable non-routine transactions in '24 and 2023, and I'll quantify those and describe our underlying results to give a better understanding of the performance from regular operations. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $8.4 billion, and EBITDA was $1 billion or 12.1% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we underwent a strategic review of our Accelera segment, which resulted in charges of $312 million, of which $305 million were noncash. Excluding this charge, we delivered EBITDA of $1.3 billion or 15.8% of sales.\nIn the fourth quarter of '23, we reported sales of $8.4 billion and an EBITDA loss of $878 million. Excluding the regulatory settlement, Atmus separation costs, and voluntary retirement and separation program costs in Q4 2023, EBITDA was positive $1.2 billion or 14.4%. I know that's a lot to digest. In summary, on an underlying basis, EBITDA improved by 140 basis points on slightly lower sales, excluding those charges I just described.\nFourth quarter revenues decreased by 1% from a year ago as organic growth was more than offset by the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America were flat while international revenues decreased 3%. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by less than 1%. The EBITDA improvement of 140 basis points was primarily due to higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency, partially offset by lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus.\nNow let me summarize some of the impacts by line item in the income statement. Gross margin was $2.1 billion or 25.4% of sales compared to $2 billion or 23.7% last year. The improved margins were driven by stronger power generation aftermarket demand, favorable pricing, particularly in Power Systems and Distribution and improved operational efficiency. Selling, administrative, and research expenses were $1.1 billion or 13.6% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.2% last year due to lower research and development costs.\nJoint venture income of $87 million decreased $26 million primarily driven by lower technology fees from some of our international partnerships and costs incurred in the ramp-up of the Amplify Cell Technology battery joint venture here in the U.S., which was formed in the second quarter of '24. Other income was negative $25 million, a decrease of $75 million from a year ago, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on investments related to company-owned life insurance.\nInterest expense was $89 million, a decrease of $3 million from a prior year, driven by lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 32.8%, principally due to nondeductible costs related to the Accelera reorganization. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $418 million or $3.02 per diluted share, which includes $312 million or $2.14 per diluted share of Accelera reorganization charges. Excluding the Accelera charges, EPS was $5.16 a diluted share.\nOperating cash flow was an inflow of $1.4 billion, just $37 million lower than the level we saw in the first quarter last year. For the full year 2024, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, slightly above a year ago and reflecting 4% growth if we exclude Atmus from both 2023 and '24. EBITDA in '24 was $6.3 billion or 18.6%. Excluding the gain in costs associated with the separation of Atmus, the Accelera charge in the fourth quarter, and first quarter restructuring expenses, EBITDA in 2024 was $5.4 billion or 15.7%. 2023 EBITDA was $3 billion or $5.2 billion and 15.3% excluding the regulatory settlement, Atmus separation costs, and voluntary retirement and separation programs.\nThe increase in EBITDA percent was primarily driven by higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiencies, more than offsetting the impact of lower North American heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in margin from the Atmus separation. All-in net earnings were $3.9 billion or $28.37 per diluted share compared to $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share a year ago. 2024 results included the gain related to the separation of Atmus, net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion or $9.28 per diluted share, charges related to Accelera reorganization of $2.12 per diluted share, and first quarter restructuring costs of $0.16 per diluted share.\nCapital expenditures in 2024 were $1.2 billion, flat compared to 2023 as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the HELM platforms within our core business in North America. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And over the past 5 years, we've returned 54% in the form of share repurchase and dividends even while we absorbed the significant acquisition in the form of Meritor. In 2024, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments, dividend growth, and returning $969 million to shareholders via the cash dividend and debt reduction. We also reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5.6 million shares from the tax-free Atmus separation share exchange.\nI will now summarize the 2024 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2025. And thankfully for you and for me, I'm going to exclude all those nonroutine items in the following pages, and thanks for staying with me as I work through that. For the Engine segment 2024 revenues were a record $11.7 billion or up $28 million compared to last year. EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, flat compared to a year ago.\nIn 2025, we project revenues for the Engine business will be down 2% to up 3% due to expected weakness in the North American truck market, particularly in the first half of the year, slightly offset by improved demand in pickup and some international markets. 2024 EBITDA is expected to improve with projections in the range of 14.2% to 15.2%. Components segment revenues were $11.7 billion in 2024, 13% lower than the prior year, and EBITDA was 13.8% of sales compared to 14.4% in '23. There were a lot of work done to improve existing operations but that was offset in the year-over-year comparisons due to the separation of Atmus.\nFor 2025, we expect total revenue for the Components business to range from down 5% to flat as 2024 included Atmus in the first quarter through March 18. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 13.8% and 14.8%. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 11% in '24 compared to 2023 and were a record $11.4 billion. EBITDA was 12.1% compared to 11.8% a year ago, driven by higher power generation volumes and pricing. We expect 2025 distribution revenues to increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 12% to 13%.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $6.4 billion, up 13% over 2023 driven primarily by power generation demand, especially data center applications. EBITDA was 18.4% or 370 basis points higher than 2023, driven by stronger volume, favorable pricing, and a continued focus on operational performance and cost reduction. In 2025, we expect Power Systems revenues to be at 2% to 7% and EBITDA to improve again and be in the range of 19% to 20%.\nAccelera revenues increased to $414 million in 2024 with a net operating loss of $452 million as we lowered costs in existing operations, partially offset by additional losses in the Amplify cell joint venture as it advances its operations. In 2025, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to reduce to $385 million to $415 million as we continue to make targeted investments aligned with market demand whilst reducing cost. We currently project 2025 company revenues to be down 2% to 3%. Company EBITDA margins are projected to be approximately 16.2% to 17.2% compared to an equivalent 15.7% in 2024. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be 24.5%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth.\nTo summarize, we delivered record sales and profitability in 2024, including strong results in the second half of the year even as demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a focus as we enter 2025, enabling us to continue investing in new products for new and existing markets, returning cash to shareholders, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nLast May, we laid out our updated financial targets through 2030. Our strong performance in 2024 represented encouraging progress towards those targets. And despite a relatively flat revenue forecast and expected weakness in North American heavy-duty truck, we expect to further improve profitability and cash flow in 2025. Thanks for joining us today, and let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark.

Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On our call today is Jen Rumsey, Chair and CEO; Mark Smith, Vice President and CFO; and Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the second quarter of 2024. And Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes and beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of the most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nI will now turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning. I'm excited to be with all of you today as I celebrate my 2-year anniversary of becoming CEO of Cummins. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the second quarter. At our recent Analyst Day, I shared that we are raising our long-term financial targets as a result of our strengthening portfolio and continued execution of our Destination Zero strategy. The strong partnerships that we have with our customers and stakeholders are key to driving our strategy and growth profile forward.\nIn this quarter, we strengthened those partnerships even further. In May, we announced with Isuzu Motors Limited the launch of a new 6.7-liter engine designed for use in Isuzu medium-duty truck lineup. This engine will power on-highway truck applications for the Japan market and will be available for Asia Pacific markets and other global markets later this year. We also announced plans to launch a battery electric powertrain for Isuzu's F-Series in North America. Availability of the medium-duty truck is expected in 2026 and will include Accelera's next-generation lithium ion phosphate or LFP battery technology.\nThese advancements mark an important milestone for both Cummins and Azus as Cummins enters the Japan on-highway market for the first time in our history. We are proud of the partnership our 2 companies have built, and I'm excited to leverage our collective strength and scale to deliver profitable growth for both partners.\nAlso this quarter, we further progressed our partnership with Daimler Trucks and buses and PACCAR as we completed the formation of our joint venture now known as Amplify cell technologies. -- to localize battery cell production in the battery supply chain in the United States. This included naming the Chief Executive Officer of the joint venture and breaking ground at a new manufacturing plant in Marshall County, Mississippi. Amplify cell technologies will enable Accelera by Cummins and our partners to advance battery cells focused on commercial and industrial applications in North America and serve our customers' evolving needs.\nThis is a significant step forward as we continue leading our industry into the next era of smarter, cleaner power. And in July, Accelera was awarded $75 million from the Department of Energy to convert approximately 360,000 square feet of existing manufacturing space at our Columbus, Indiana engine plant for 0 emissions components, including battery packs and electric powertrain systems. The $75 million grant is the largest federal grant ever awarded solely to Cummins and as part of the appropriations related to the inflation Reduction Act. The Columbus engine plant is also where we manufacture blocks and heads for our current and next-generation engine-based solutions, further showcasing our Destination Zero strategy in action.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter of 2024. Sales for the quarter were $8.8 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by continued high demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago.\nSecond quarter 2023 results included $23 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded supply chain cost increases and offset the impact of the Atmus separation. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 4% to $5.5 billion, driven by the strong demand in our core markets more than offsetting the impact of the separation of Atmus. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter were 75,000 units, up 1% from 2023 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 31,000, up 7% from a year ago.\nThe second quarter marked record production volume for our heavy-duty engines at the Jamestown Engine plant. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels. while our unit sales were 38,000, up 13% and also outpacing the market growth. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for using the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% from 2023. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 23% and driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment.\nOur second quarter international revenues decreased 2% compared to last year. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint venture, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 2% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 270,000 units, a decrease of 3% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with higher orders for natural gas engines and strong exports offsetting weak domestic diesel demand.\nIn light-duty market in China, we were up 4% from 2023 levels at 480,000 units while our units sold, including joint ventures, were $33,000, an increase of 18%. The Industry demand for excavators in China in the second quarter was 53,000 units, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 10,000 units, an increase of 19% as a result of [ QSM 15 ] penetration at both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 36% in the second quarter, primarily driven by accelerating demand in data centers. This helped drive aggressive financial performance at our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within our Power Systems business.\nSecond quarter revenues in India, including joint venture, were $649 million, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 11% and while our shipments increased by 5%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 17% year-on-year as the second quarter of 2023 benefited from pre-buy demand ahead of emissions regulation changes.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our expectations for 2024 while still anticipating the second half to be weaker than the first half, primarily in the North America heavy-duty truck market. We are increasing our revenue guidance to down 3% to flat compared to our prior guidance of down 2% to down 5%. We are also increasing our EBITDA guide to be 15% to 15.5% compared to our prior guide of 14.5% to 15.5%.\nWe now expect higher revenue in our engine, Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting slightly lower revenue expectations for the Accelera business. We also expect stronger profitability in our engine and Power Systems segments, driving most of the improvement in EBITDA. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 as we still expect softening in the second half of the year.\nIn the North America medium-duty truck market, we are raising our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength in vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, and with a planned model year changeover likely to drive a temporary dip in production in the second half.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 8% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect slightly weaker property investment and slowing export demand in China.\nWe are raising our guidance for the global power generation market to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% to 15%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, we have improved our guidance to flat to up 5% for 2024, raising the bottom end of our previous guidance of a decline of 5%, with demand holding up better than expected in on- and off-highway markets. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million, a reduction of $50 million from the prior guide. As we noted at our Analyst Day, the energy transition is progressing more slowly, impacting both our e-mobility and electrolyzer revenues.\nIn summary, coming off a strong first half of the year, we are raising our guidance on sales to down 3% to flat and raising our EBITDA guidance to 15% to 15.5%. While we anticipate softening in the North America heavy-duty market in the second half of the year, demand in several of our core markets remain strong. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to shareholders.\nIn July, we announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.68 to $1.82 per share, the 15th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. During the quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders in the form of dividends consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Our diluted earnings per share benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding with the impact of the Atmus split more fully reflected in the weighted average share count in the second quarter.\nIn summary, we had a strong performance in the first half of 2024, driven by record demand for Cummins products in our core markets. It is exciting to see our business grow with long-established customers in existing markets and to see newer partnerships yield additional opportunities in previously untapped markets for comments. I'm grateful for our employees who continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solutions that help our customers win wherever they operate. Our results reflect our dedication to delivering strong financial performance while also investing in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. As we discussed at Analyst Day, there is a lot to be excited about in our future.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter. Given the strength of those results and our improved outlook, we've raised the midpoint of our full year expectations for 2024. Second quarter revenues were $8.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago, as organic growth more than offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America increased 4%, while international revenues decreased 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%.\nEBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. The year ago numbers included $23 million of costs related to the separation of apps. The benefits of higher volumes and pricing as well as the absence of the separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability.\nNow I'll go into a little more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.19 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $2.15 billion or also 24.9% a year ago. flat margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, offset by the removal of Atmus and higher compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.21 billion or 13.7% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 14.6% last year.\nJoint venture income of $103 million decreased $30 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees and the weak domestic truck market in China. Other income was negative $3 million, a decrease of $27 million a year ago. Interest expense was $109 million, an increase of $10 million from prior year primarily driven by higher weighted average interest rates.\nThe all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, including $9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $726 million or $5.26 per diluted share compared to $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share in Q2 last year. The second quarter reflected the lower weighted average share count as a result of the tax-free share exchange that there was the final separation of Atmus was completed in the first quarter.\nAll-in, operating cash flow was an outflow of $851 million compared to an inflow of $483 million in the second quarter last year, and the decrease was driven mainly by the $1.9 billion payment required by the previously disclosed settlement agreements with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion, more than double the cash generated in the second quarter last year.\nI will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations of Atlas in our consolidated results up until the full separation that occurred on March 18. Components segment revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of 13% from the prior year while EBITDA decreased from 14.2% of sales to 13.6%, with both sales and EBITDA primarily impacted by the Atmus separation. For Components, we expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14%, consistent with our prior projections and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, narrowing the range from our previous guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%.\nFor the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were a record $3.2 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a slight decrease from 14.2% a year to go as the benefit from pricing and record on-highway volumes in North America was offset by higher research costs and lower joint venture income, primarily in China. In 2024, we now project -- for the full year 2024, sorry, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 3% to up 2%, an increase of 2% from the prior midpoint driven by a revised outlook in the North American medium-duty truck market. Full year Engine EBITDA is projected to be in the range of $13.7 million to $14.2 million. an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint from our prior projections due to higher volumes and ongoing operational efficiencies.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 9% from a year ago to a record $2.8 billion. EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased to 11.1% compared to 11.4% a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses and a higher mix of power generation sales, which are positive for the company overall, but have a dilutive impact on the Distribution segment margins. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10%, an increase of 5% from the prior midpoint, mainly due to stronger power generation markets. And we've revised our EBITDA margin expectations to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.8%, down a little from our prior range of 11.5% to 12.5%.\nResults for the Power Systems segment set a new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% and EBITDA increased from 13.8% and to 18.9%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements and cost reduction. For 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be up 3% to 8%, an increase of 3% from the prior year guide. EBITDA is now projected to be approximately 17.5% to 18% and up from the previous projections of 16% to 17%.\nAccelera revenues increased 31% to $111 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $117 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected, whilst reducing costs in areas where we accept the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, down $50 million from our prior guide. Net losses are still expected to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million.\nAs Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the second quarter and the revised outlook in our key region end markets, we have raised our full year company guidance. We now expect revenues to be down 3% to flat, which is better than our previous guidance of down 2% to down 5%. EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 15% to 15.5%, narrowing the range and increasing the midpoint 25 basis points from our prior guide. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from 3 months ago. as we continue to make critical investments in new products and capacity expansion to support future growth.\nIn summary, we delivered record sales and solid profitability in the second quarter of 2024. We still do expect some moderation in some key markets in the second half of the year, especially North American heavy-duty truck, as we pointed out at our recent Analyst Day also. We've taken some cost to reduce -- we took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward, leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality that we may experience.\nWe continue to deliver strong financial results raising our performance cycle over cycle while still investing for future growth. Our priorities for this year for capital allocation remain to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend and reduce debt. Overall, a very strong quarter.\nThanks for your time today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please join the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.",

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.\nOur actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. .\nIn March, Cummins successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions, while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. We are proud of our employees' hard work and all who were involved to ensure successful separation, and we are excited to see what the future holds for both Cummins and Atmus. The final step in the separation of Atmus resulted in a tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced common shares outstanding by 5.6 million.\nIn addition, we reintroduced our fuel-agnostic platforms with the name that captures the innovation that powers us forward, Cummins HELM platform. With higher efficiency, lower emissions and multiple fuels, the Cummins HELM platforms give our customers control of how they navigate their own journeys as part of the energy transition.\nAs the next product in the Cummins HELM 15-liter platform, we announced we will launch the next-generation diesel X15 in North America for the heavy duty on-highway market, which will be compliant with the U.S. EPA and CARB 2027 aligned regulations at launch. Lastly, in April, Cummins Power Generation introduced 4 new generator sets to the award-winning CentumTM Series, powered by Cummins QSK50 and QSK78 engines. These new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers, health care facilities and wastewater treatment plant.\nI was excited to attend the launch event with our customers and hear about the growing demand for these critical applications and high interest in our genset products, which build on decades of experience meeting our customers' needs and deliver a step change improvement in power density, assured reliability, sustainability and low emissions. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets.\nDemand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.1% a year ago. First quarter 2024 results include a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses as we continue to work to simplify our operating structure and improve the efficiency of our business for the long term.\nThis compares to the first quarter 2023 results, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses, EBITDA percentage decreased by 80 basis points as improved pricing partially offset lower volumes and higher research and development expenses as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future.\nGross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the benefits of pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes and supply chain cost increases.\nOur first quarter revenues in North America were flat with 2023. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 73,000 units, down 5% from 2023 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, down 7% from 2023. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 8%, while our unit sales were $36,000, up 22% from 2023. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from the 2023 levels.\nRevenues for North America power generation increased by 21%, driven by continued, strong data center and mission-critical power demand. Our international revenues decreased by 1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5% as the weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with the accelerating data center demand. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 305,000 units, an increase of 14% from last year. However, shifts in the market share during the first quarter led to a decline in our volumes year-over-year. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2023 levels at 486,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 37,000, an increase of 3%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 50,000 units, a decrease of 13% from 2023 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weak property investment, high equipment population and slowing export demand. Our units sold were 9,000 units, an increase of 10% as a result of the QSM15 penetration and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 7% in the first quarter as accelerating data center demand was offset by softening in other markets.\nFirst quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $758 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 7%, while our shipments decreased by 5% as the market slowed ahead of elections in April. Power Generation revenues increased by 37% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. Now let me provide an outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets.\nOur full year guidance now excludes Atmus from the March 18 separation date onwards and also include -- excludes the first quarter gain related to the divestiture. The guidance provided previously included Atmus for the full year as it preceded the transaction announcement. We are happy to share that our expectations for 2024 have improved from our initial guidance issued in February. Our forecast for total company revenue in 2024 remains the same at down 2% to 5%, which implies higher base business revenues of approximately $1.3 billion compared to our prior guidance as Atmus is now excluded from future quarters.\nWe are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 compared to our prior guide of 245,000 to 265,000 units, though We do still expect softening in the second half of the year. In North America, medium-duty truck market, we maintain our prior guidance of 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat from 2023, consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, down 5% to 10% from 2023 as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance.\nWe project a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be in the range -- to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and potentially slower export demand. The short-term shifts in the market share that I noted earlier are expected to normalize as we progress through the remainder of the year. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand, consistent with our prior guidance.\nWe expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, up from our previous guidance of down 5% to 15%. We continue to expect weak property investment and slowing export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024.\nWe are raising our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 10% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of about 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. While a smaller market for us, we continue to anticipate demand for oil and gas engines to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America.\nFor aftermarket, we've maintained our guidance of down 5% to up 5% for 2024, as we are through the inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to $354 million in 2023, consistent with our prior guidance. We are ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and capability to deliver orders to our customers as well as expect continued growth in electrified components.\nIn summary, coming off a strong first quarter, we are maintaining our sales growth outlook for the year of down 2% to 5% as stronger demand in our base business has offset the removal of Atmus for future quarters from our guidance. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to our previous guidance of 14.4% to 15.4%, reflecting stronger North America heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, which more than offsets the loss of profitability of Atmus.\nIn addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. During the quarter, we returned $239 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.\nIn addition, we reduced the overall Cummins share count by $5.6 million as we completed the Atmus share exchange, which will be more fully reflected in the average share count in the second quarter and beyond. I am impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world for delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in the future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect our planet for future generations and returning cash to our shareholders.\nI look forward to discussing our long-term strategy further in our upcoming Analyst Day on May 16 and now let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter revenue and profitability and generated positive operating cash flow. Given the strength of first quarter results and our improved outlook, we've raised our full year expectations for 2024 after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. First quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. The separation of Atmus in mid-March resulted in a year-over-year sales decline of around 1% to our -- to Cummins consolidated sales. .\nOur underlying revenues increased in North America and Latin America and were offset by weaker demand in China and Europe. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales for the quarter. We completed the tax-free full separation of Atmus in March, which resulted in a onetime gain on the divestiture of $1.3 billion, net of transaction costs and other expenses. First quarter results also included $29 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to first quarter of 2023, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus.\nTo provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to prior year, I am excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses in my following comments. Financial results of Atmus through March 18 are included in our first quarter consolidated sales and EBITDA. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.3% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percentage was driven by investment in new products and capabilities and lower sales volumes.\nNow let's look into more detailed by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.5% of sales compared to $2 billion or 24% even last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in the Power Systems business. Selling, administrative and research expenses increased by $72 million, driven by higher research costs as we continue to bring to market new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly the development of the HELM product line within the Engine business.\nJoint venture income of $123 million increased $4 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings in the Power Systems segment. Other income was $21 million, a decrease of $50 million from a year ago. The decrease in other income is driven by the relative negative impact of foreign currency revaluation and lower gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance compared to a year ago. Interest expense was $89 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding, long-term borrowings related to the bond issuance we completed in February.\nThe all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, mainly due to the tax-free gain on the separation of Atmus. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share, which includes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus of $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per share.\nJust to reinforce what Jen said, full impact of the lower share count from the Atmus separation will be seen in future quarters since the diluted share counts counted on a weighted average basis. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $276 million compared to an inflow of $495 million in the first quarter last year. Now let me comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024.\nAs a reminder, prior guidance for 2024 assume that the operations of Atmus would be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Components segment revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 6%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, increased from 14.6% of sales to 14.8% driven primarily by improved performance within Cummins [indiscernible]. For Components, we've updated the guidance for the segment following the separation of Atmus and expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14% and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%.\nOur latest guidance reflects an increase in both revenues and EBITDA margins after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 2% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a decrease from 15.3% a year ago as the benefit of pricing offset by lower volumes and higher research costs. 2024, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 5% to flat, an improvement of 2% at the midpoint from our prior year projections, reflecting a revised outlook in the North American truck markets and stronger-than-expected demand from our construction customers.\n2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.7%, an increase of 20 basis points at the midpoint due to higher volumes. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 5% from a year ago to $2.5 billion. EBITDA decreased as a percent of sales to 11.6% compared to 13.9% of sales a year ago as aftermarket sales, particularly to industrial customers declined from the record levels that we experienced a year ago.\nWe expect 2024 distribution revenues to be flat to up 5% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, an increase from the prior guide of 3% for revenues and a modest improvement to margins for the full year. Power Systems segment revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 3% and EBITDA increased from 16.3% to 17.1% of sales driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and operating improvements, all of which contributed to a strong trend of improving performance in that segment.\n2024, we now expect Power Systems revenues to be flat to 5%, up 3% at the midpoint and EBITDA has also increased to be approximately 16% to 17%, up 80 basis points from our previous guide. Accelera revenues increased 9% to $93 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $101 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $94 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support future growth.\nIn 2024, our guidance is unchanged. We expect revenues to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $433 million consistent with our prior guide. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions, end markets, we are adjusting the full year company guidance, and we project company revenue -- consolidated company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, consistent with the prior year guidance despite the separation of ass.\nCompany EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 14.5% to 15.5%, up 10 basis points from prior guidance, all of which excludes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24%, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from our outlook 3 months ago as we continue to make critical investments in new products, capacity expansion to support future growth.\nIn summary, we delivered solid sales, profitability and positive cash flow in the first quarter. We do still expect moderation in some of our key markets in the second half of 2024, but we have raised our expectations of our own performance relative to our prior guide. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality and continue investing and delivering strong financial performance. Our priorities in 2024 for capital allocation are unchanged. We will reinvest for growth, plan to raise the dividend and reduce debt. Thank you for your interest today, and I look forward to seeing some of you in person in New York at our upcoming Analyst Day.\nNow let me turn it over to Chris.",

Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year.\nAs I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders, and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy, and it continues to be clear that this dual path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact.\nWe did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new 0 emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins.\nMost notably for our poor business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our U.S. engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine platforms as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy-duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year.\nIn our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks & Buses, PACCAR and EV Energy to accelerate and localize battery cell production in the battery supply chain in the U.S. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027.\nAccelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers in the Cummins power generation facility in Fridley, Minnesota.\nLastly, we are resolute about the leading role we play in the energy transition, and emissions compliance continues to be a critical element of this work and central to our values. We were transparent about this in December when we announced that we reached an agreement in principle to resolve U.S. regulatory claims regarding our mission certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement with the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy.\nWe have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world. Our product compliance and regulatory affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come us to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totaled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmos business. This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmos business.\nExcluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs.\nResearch and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments.\nIn addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion, compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business. 2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022.\n2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business.\nExcluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling and administrative, research and development and inflation costs. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the Distribution, Components and Power Systems segment.\nOur Power Systems business, in particular, finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year.\nIn addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022 as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach.\nIn addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees' efforts in 2023 as they help deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward.\nNow let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmos for the full year, but excludes any cost or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy-duty truck. Early in 2024, we expect the heavy-duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023 with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year.\nIndustry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium-duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024. We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% and demand in light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand.\nDespite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy-duty market.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year-over-year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China.\nWe project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10% driven by continued increases in the data center, and mission-critical markets. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%. While a small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect the range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023.\nIn Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to the $354 million in 2023. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 to 18 months as well as expect continued growth in electrified components.\nIn summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow. Excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence and improved Accelera sales.\nIn addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors.\nAs I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge over heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dower than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital.\nNow let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% of sales. For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion, and EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a onetime charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed U.S. regulatory claims.\nFourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmos were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compared to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year.\nFull year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business and now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmos and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8% driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products.\nInternational revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment in development and capabilities now in Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year.\nNow I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail. Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favorable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses.\nSelling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development, new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter.\nInterest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year, driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion in our debt. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to nondeductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All-in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmos.\nOperating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher in the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business. For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth.\nSales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market and slowly improving economic conditions in China.\nEBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favorable pricing and logistics costs and a modest favorable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses. All-in net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion of $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmos, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter.\nFull year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the few agnostic platforms within our core business.\nOur long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And over the past 5 years, we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\nIf we all-in -- I jumped on Page 2, sorry about that. I've gone the wrong way. That can happen some times. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year.\nI'll now summarize the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmos, the costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022.\nComponents segment record revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the Components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%.\nFor the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion, and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the Engine business will decrease 2% to 7%, due to expected moderation in the North American truck -- heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion. The EBITDA increased by 28%, and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect Distribution revenues to be down -- between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues were also a record of $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022, driven by favorable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2%, and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%.\nAccelera revenues increased to $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million. In 2024, we expect -- Accelera -- we anticipate that Accelera revenues will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies whilst improving the operating performance of our current products.\nWe currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in '24, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth.\nTo summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during terms of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the U.S. truck market as reflected in our guidance. We've already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle, improve our cycle over cycle performance in 2024.\nSubject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split off the remaining ownership in Atmos through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future. As per part of the proposed exchange offer, common shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of common stock for shares of Atmos common stock, subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depending on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days.\nOur guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmos now consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and exclude any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed.\nThank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.",

Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions under the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. No information regarding such risks and uncertainty is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck, and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the [indiscernible] section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures.\nOur press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the details of our performance, I'm excited to first highlight a few major events from the third quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On September 6, Accelera by Cummins, Daimler Truck and Bus and PACCAR, along with EV Energy joined forces to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. The planned joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications, creating highly desirable manufacturing jobs in the United States in the growing clean technology sector.\nTotal investment by the partners is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the 21-gigawatt hour factory with production expected to begin in 2027. We see this partnership as an opportunity to share investment with 2 long-standing partners while advancing a key technology solution for our customers and industry and collectively to accelerate the energy transition in the United States.\nIn October, Cummins completed its acquisition of 2 Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants and their related activities, one in Columbus, Indiana and one in Warman, Netherlands. This acquisition is a natural addition to the Cummins Emission Solutions business and will help ensure we meet current and future demand for low emission products.\nLastly, Cummins announced several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Freightliner announced they are working with Cummins to offer the new X15N natural gas in and its heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia trucks.\nAlso, Cummins and Knight Transportation, Inc. announced that the industry's largest full truckload company has successfully tested Cummins new X15N engine, in Southern California, using renewable natural gas to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance.\nThe X15N, which will launch in North America in 2024, is the first natural gas engine to be designed specifically for the heavy-duty on-highway truck application.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets.\nDemand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, and driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2022 included 2 months of consolidated operations for Meritor following the completion of the acquisition on August 3, 2022.\nEBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% compared to $884 million or 12.1% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results include $26 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to third quarter 2022 results, which included $77 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and inventory valuation adjustments of Meritor and $16 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.\nExcluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 14.9% in the third quarter of 2023 represented an improvement from 13.3% we delivered in 2022, as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs.\nThird quarter of 2022 also included a onetime employee recognition bonus of $56 million. Research and development expense increased in the third quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages for us in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments.\nIn addition, operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was a record inflow of $1.5 billion compared to the $382 million in the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on our working capital management within the business.\nI am proud of our leaders and employees for their efforts in driving down costs and operational focus to achieve this record result for the quarter, and we will continue to focus on strong cash generation moving forward.\nOur third quarter revenues in North America grew 16% to $5.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets.\nIndustry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 74,000 units, up 1% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 18% from last year, reflecting strong demand for our products.\nIndustry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7% from 2022 levels while our unit sales were 32,000, up 19% from 2022.\nWe shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their ramp pickups in the third quarter of 2023, flat with 2022 levels.\nEngine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 8%, driven primarily by high inventory in the channel.\nRevenues in North America power generation increased by 15% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply constraints eased modestly.\nOur international revenues increased by 13% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago, with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets.\nThird quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 24% as markets continue to recover compared to a very weak third quarter of 2022.\nIndustry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 243,000 units, an increase of 48% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 36%.\nIn light-duty markets in China, we saw increase of 14% from 2022 levels at 442,000 units while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 26,000, an increase of 12%.\nIndustry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 40,000 units, a decrease of 30% from 2022 levels. The decrease in market size is due to weaker activity in construction. Our units sold were 7,000 units, flat with 2022 levels as increased penetration at new and existing customers offset the declining markets.\nSales of power generation equipment in China increased 5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by slight improvement in nondata center markets.\nThird quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $730 million, an increase of 13% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 17% while our shipments increased 23%.\nPower Generation revenues decreased by 16% due to the second quarter pre-buy ahead of emissions regulation changes.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are raising full year 2023 revenue guidance to be up 18% to 21% versus last year. We are also narrowing our EBITDA guidance range to be 15.2% to 15.4%. We now expect higher full year revenues in our Components segment and higher profitability in our Power Systems segment, offset by decreased profitability in our engine business as a result of opening aftermarket and off-highway markets.\nWe are raising our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 280,000 to 300,000 units in 2023 after a strong third quarter. Our current guidance past lower industry production in the fourth quarter. While orders remain relatively strong, inventory management, truck component shortages, limiting our OEM production rates and fewer working days are being to our view for the quarter.\nIn North America medium-duty truck market, we are maintaining full year 2023 market size guidance of 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. While we continue to work to increase our production through rebalancing across our global plants and improving the supply base, industry production continues to be limited due to other supply chain constraints.\nConsistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels in line with 2022.\nAdditionally, we maintain our guidance for North America construction to be down 10% to flat, driven by high channel inventory and softening market conditions.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in light-duty truck market coming off the low market levels in 2022, and that's consistent with the prior guidance.\nDespite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the expanding fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas power by the end of 2023. In the short time since launching our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we expect momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. We look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024.\nWe expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10% in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, consistent with our prior forecast. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, consistent with our prior guide.\nRevenues in the global power generation markets are expected to increase 15% to 20%, consistent with our prior guide, with the strong performance driven primarily by improvement in the data center and mission-critical markets.\nFor Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million and also maintain our EBITDA guidance of the expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023.\nWithin Components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%.\nIn summary, we are raising our guidance on sales of up 18% to 21% and narrowing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.2% to 15.4%.\nOur guidance for the full year implies weaker revenue in the fourth quarter. While demand remained strong in several markets, softening in the aftermarket demand, a continued weak outlook in China, continued industry supply constraints impacting North America truck production and inventory management efforts across many markets are some of the factors driving the lower fourth quarter run rate.\nIn view of the lower forecasted revenues, we have initiated actions to reduce costs in our business, particularly in selling and administrative costs. In order to lower costs as we move into next year, we are offering voluntary retirement and a voluntary separation program in select regions and parts of our business for eligible exempt employees.\nWe will continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further action while continuing to invest for our future.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our long-term strategic goal is to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.\nThe strong execution from the second quarter of 2023 continued into the third quarter, driving record operating cash flow despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. As we look forward to the opportunities ahead, we have a strong, capable leadership team who will help us successfully navigate an exciting and changing future.\nToday, I was also pleased to announce several promotions on my leadership team, which will be effective January 1 of next year. First, Srikanth Padmanabhan, currently Vice President and President of the Engine business, will take on a newly created role of Executive Vice President and President of Operations. In this role, Srikanth will be an important work that will define and drive improvements in how we operate as a company through the energy transition and ensure our success of our operational priorities.\nThroughout his more than 30 years at Cummins, Srikanth has worked across many of Cummins businesses and regions and consistently pushed the boundaries of customer-focused innovation to position Cummins as the leading powertrain supplier of choice in the transition to a net zero future.\nSrikanth is a result and people-driven leader and is the perfect choice to lead this work.\nSecond, Brett Merritt, currently Vice President of On-Highway Engine business and Strategic Customer Relations will assume the role of Vice President and President of the Engine business, replacing Srikanth when he takes his new role.\nBrett has spent more than 25 years in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry and more than 14 at Cummins. The past 11 spent leading and growing the On-highway business from 800,000 engines in 2012 to 1.2 million engines last year. Brett is an experienced business leader and a trusted partner to many of our key customers, and I'm excited for Brett to lead this segment.\nBonnie Fetch, currently Vice President of Global Supply Chain, will assume the role of Vice President and President of our Distribution business, replacing Tony Satterthwaite, who has been acting as interim head of DBU.\nBonnie, who previously led supply chain for DBU has led the Cummins global supply chain and manufacturing organization, including Cummins newer [indiscernible] where she led her team in performance. Her more than 30 years of experience, including 20 years at Caterpillar, before coming to Cummins, includes general management, HR and supply chain leadership and makes her uniquely qualified for this role.\nI'm excited for her to leverage her broad experience to run this segment.\nThis is a period of change for our company, and it's also an exciting one. I want to end by thanking our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet our customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships and navigating continued supply chain challenges.\nOur results reflect our focus on delivering strong operating performance, investing in future growth and bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry while returning cash to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 16% and international revenues grew 13%. Organic sales growth was 10%, driven by improved pricing and strong demand for our on-highway and power generation products. 5% of the total increase in sales was driven by the addition of Meritor.\nEBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales for the quarter and $26 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 was $884 million or 12.1% of sales, including $16 million of costs associated with the planned [indiscernible]. And $77 million of our integration and inventory valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of Meritor. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and Meritor adjustments, Underlying EBITDA third quarter was 14.9% compared to 13.3% a year ago. The higher EBITDA percentage was driven by favorable pricing to cover rising input costs and improved logistics costs, partially offset by higher variable compensation associated with the stronger overall company financial performance.\nIn addition, we issued a onetime employee recognition bonus in the third quarter of last year, totaling $56 million.\nTo provide clarity on operational performance in comparison to our guidance and excluding costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the acquisition integration and inventory valuation stats related to the acquisition of Meritor in my following comments. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August of 2022, resulting in 1 additional month of operational performance in Q3 this year compared to last year.\nNow I'll go into more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.6% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 22.9% last year.\nGross margin increased by 170 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and logistics costs and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nSelling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.1% of sales compared to $997 million or 13.6% with the increase primarily driven by both higher variable compensation and higher engineering costs associated with new products across the company.\nIncome from joint ventures was $118 million, $48 million higher than the previous year, driven by the receipt of technology fees and slowly improving demand in China, which boosted the operational results.\nOther income was a negative $7 million or $20 million lower than a year ago, driven by foreign currency translation. Also included in other income was $28 million of mark-to-market losses on investments.\nInterest expense increased by $36 million, primarily due to highest higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The [indiscernible] effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.4%, including $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share of favorable discrete items.\nAll-in net earnings for the quarter was $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share, including $26 million or $0.14 per diluted share of costs associated with the separation of Atmus.\nAll-in net earnings in the third quarter of last year were $400 million or $2.82 per diluted share, which included $26 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and $77 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor.\nAll-in operating cash flow was a record quarterly inflow of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion higher than last year, driven by solid earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Generating strong operating cash flow remains a key focus area for the company, and we were pleased with the progress in the third quarter.\nI will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes a full year of operations for Meritor and Atmus and excludes any costs of benefit related to the separation of Atmus. Guidance also excludes the impact of any cost reduction activities within Cummins in the fourth quarter.\nAs Jen mentioned, we're raising our revenue guidance for the company to 18% to 21%, up slightly from our previous guidance of 15% to 20%, driven by strong demand in North America.\nEBITDA is now expected to be 15.2% to 15.4% compared to our previous range of 15% to 15.7%. And we are also narrowing the EBITDA ranges for most of our business segments.\nComponents segment revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. EBITDA was 14.2%. Back with the prior year, while EBITDA dollars increased from $384 million to $461 million. Meritor -- Cummins Meritor revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, and EBITDA was $129 million or 11% of sales, a significant improvement from last year and in line with our expectations.\nFor the Components Segment, we now expect total 2023 revenues to increase 35% to 40%, a 3% increase from our previous revenue guidance with EBITDA in the range of 14.2% to 14.7% compared to our previous range of 14.1% to 14.8%.\nWithin Components, Meritor revenues are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, consistent with prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% compared to our previous forecast of 10.3% to 11%. Lots of small changes in the individual segment guidance as we get closer to the end of the year.\nFor the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA 13.5% compared to 13% in 2022 driven by operational improvements and the impact of the onetime employee bonus in the prior year.\nIn 2023, we project revenues for the Engine business will increase 2% to 7% and consistent with our prior projection and EBITDA in the range of 13.6% to 14.1%, a slight decrease from our previous guide of 13.8% to 14.5% due to a continuing softening in our aftermarket revenues and some weaker demand in some off-highway markets.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 12.1% and compared to 10% of sales a year ago, driven by stronger volumes, improved pricing and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year.\nWe expect distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15%, consistent with prior guidance and narrowing the expected EBITDA range to 11.9% to 12.4%.\nIn the Power Systems business, revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 7%. And EBITDA increased from 14.3% to 16.2%, continuing a trend of last 6 quarters of improving margins driven by pricing, higher volumes, operational and cost reduction activities have all contributed to the continuing improving performance.\nIn 2023, we expect revenues to be up 8% to 13%, consistent with the prior guidance. And we're raising the expected EBITDA to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.3%, up from our previous projection of 14.3% to 15%.\nSeller revenues more than doubled to $103 million, driven by electrolyzer project delivery, higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the addition of the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business electric powertrain portion of the Medical business.\nOur EBITDA loss in the segment of $114 million will continue to support strong future growth. Our guidance for the top line and the bottom line [indiscernible] unchanged with revenues in the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses of $420 million to $440 million.\nOur effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items.\nOur outlook for capital investments is unchanged and expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion .\nWe will continue to focus on deploying cash to fund investments that drive profitable growth, debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividend this year.\nIn summary, we delivered strong sales, solid profitability in the third quarter and record operating cash flow. We'll continue to focus on managing working capital delivering strong margins and investing in the products and technologies that will drive future growth. As we indicated last quarter, we see signs of softening aftermarket demand and weaker demand in some industrial parts. These, combined with less production days in the fourth quarter are expected to contribute to lower revenues and profitability.\nHave initiated some steps to the costs, as Jennifer outlined, and we'll continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further actions. Our priorities in 2023 for capital allocation, as I've said, to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend and reduce debt.\nIn July, we announced a 7% increase in the dividend, our 14th consecutive year of quarterly dividend growth. And through the end of the third quarter, we have reduced debt by $390 million. Furthermore, in October, we reduced debt by a further $650 million, consistent with our plans for the year.\nThank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.",

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Our host for today's call is Chris Clulow, VP of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host. Chris, you may begin.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.\nMore information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On April 3, United States President, Joe Biden, visited company facilities in Friendly, Minnesota to tour Accelera by Cummins, first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers, a key technology to produce no carbon hydrogen. Accelera is initially dedicating 89,000 square feet of the existing Cummins power generation facility in Free to electrolyze their production with the opportunity to expand to meet the growing demand. Accelera also reached a further milestone of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million at the end of the quarter for this facility will help address that growing demand, along with other capacity being added globally.\nLastly, progress continues to be made on the separation of the Filtration business. On May 26, and Atmos Filtration Technologies Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ATMU in connection with its initial public offering. Upon the completion of the IPO, Cummins retained approximately 80.5% of Atmos outstanding shares. The Atmos IPO generated $299 million of net proceeds and Atmos added $650 million of debt. Cummins realizes the benefit of the IPO proceedings and the debt issuance as Atmos will hold the debt at full separation.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets.\nDemand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% compared to $1.1 billion or 16% a year ago.\nSecond quarter 2023 results include $23 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to second quarter 2022 results, which include $47 million in recovery of amounts reserved related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia, offset by $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023 represented a slight decline from the 15.7% we delivered in 2022, principally due to the addition of Meritor activity, which currently has a lower gross margin percentage than our other businesses and increased SG&A and development expenses.\nEBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes, pricing and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. The strong EBITDA performance of the business in the first half drove an increase in selling and administrative expenses versus the prior year as we recorded higher accruals related to our variable compensation plans during the quarter.\nResearch and development expenses also increased in the second quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.2 billion and EBITDA of 12.2%.\nThe improvement in the profitability from the first quarter EBITDA margin of 9.4% was driven by pricing to cover inflation, operational improvements and cost reduction activities, which more than offset material cost increases that we expect to persist through the second half of the year. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 31% to $5.3 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets.\nIndustry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 77,000 units, up 11% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, also up 11% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 34,000, up 27% from 2022.\nWe shipped 38,000 engines istalantus for use in their ramp pickups in the second quarter of 2023, flat with the 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 8%, driven primarily by positive net pricing. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 16% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints eased modestly.\nOur international revenues increased by 32% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago, with the addition of Meritor and a strong demand across most markets. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 37% and as markets began to recover compared to a very weak second quarter of 2022, which was impaired by COVID shutdowns in Shanghai and other regions.\nIndustry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 279,000 units, an increase of 61% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 63% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new products launched to meet the NS VI standard.\nThe light-duty market in China was up 21% from 2022 levels at 460,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were $28,000, an increase of 23%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 51,000 units, a decrease of 23% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weaker activity and construction. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 5%, driven by improved share with new and expanded customer relationships for both domestic and export usage.\nSales of power generation equipment in China decreased 8% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a decline in the data center market. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $724 million, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of a year ago.\nIndustry truck production increased by 2%, while our shipments increased 1%. Power Generation revenues increased by 75% in the second quarter, driven by strong economic activity and customer demand ahead of a July 1 emissions regulation change.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2023 revenue guidance of up 15% to 20% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.7%.\nWe now expect stronger revenue and profitability in both our Power Systems and Distribution segments than we did 3 months ago, offset by increased cost in the Accelera business. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023.\nSupply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce and while end customer demand remains strong currently, our current guidance forecasts lower industry truck production in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are projecting the market size to be 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units.\nSimilar to heavy duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. However, through the rebalancing across our global plant efforts to improve the supply base, we have been able to increase our production, resulting in the improved outlook. The improvement in the medium-duty outlook was offset by decreases in our forecast for 2 other markets.\nNorth America construction is now expected to be down 10% to flat versus our previous guidance of flat to up 10%. Secondly, Brazil truck is expected to be down 30% to 40%, a decline from our prior guidance of down 10% to 20% as the market adjusts to Euro 6 equivalent emission standards. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be $140,000 to $150,000 in 2023. Volume levels in line with 2022.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increases. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the light-duty truck demand coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with prior guidance.\nDespite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for our products, including the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas powered by the end of 2023.\nIn the short time since we launched our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we look forward to launching the 50-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volumes to be flat to down 10%, in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, an improvement from our previous forecast of about 1%, propelled by stronger power generation and on-highway sales. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horse car markets to remain strong in 2023.\nSales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, an improvement from our previous guidance of down 5% to up 5%. Revenues in global power generation markets are now expected to increase 15% to 20%, up from our previous guidance of a 10% to 15% increase, driven by nonresidential construction and improvement in the data center markets.\nFor Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. As noted in my highlights, the electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum with our near-term focus on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As we scale up to serve the electrolyzer opportunity continue to develop our products and support our customers in the field, costs are running higher than originally projected for the year.\nAs a result, we have revised our EBITDA guidance for Accelera to an expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023 versus our prior guidance of $370 million to $390 million. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance.\nIn summary, coming off a very strong first half where we produced record revenues and record EBITDA while delivering for our customers, we are maintaining our guidance of sales up 15% to 20% and and EBITDA of 15% to 15.7%. Demand in most of our core markets is strong, while we continue to closely monitor global economic indicators. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins will remain in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our shareholders.\nOur guidance for the full year implies weaker revenue in the second half of the year. While demand remained strong in several markets, a weaker outlook in China versus the first half, an expected decrease in the North American heavy-duty truck production in the fourth quarter and the previously mentioned North America construction and Brazil truck decrease are some of the factors driving the lower second half run rate.\nIn view of the lowered forecasted revenues in the second half of the year, we expect to manage our operating expenses below the second quarter levels. During the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders.\nShortly after quarter end, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.57 to $1.68 per share, the 14th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. The strong execution from the first quarter of 2023 continued into the second, resulting in record sales and strong profitability despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment.\nI want to thank our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships and navigating continued supply chain constraints. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operational performance, investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were a record $8.6 billion, up 31% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 31% and international sales increased 32%. Our organic sales growth rate was 12%, driven by improved pricing and strong end market demand for our products globally, with a balance of 19% increase in sales driven by the addition of Meritor.\nForeign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1% overall. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% of sales for the quarter, including $23 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion or 16% of sales, including a onetime $47 million benefit related to the adjustment of our reserves as we suspended our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus apps.\nExcluding the utmost separation costs and the impact from Russia year ago, EBITDA in the second quarter of this year was 15.4% compared to 15.7% a year ago. lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by the dilutive impact of Meritor, higher variable compensation costs, which showed up largely in our line and in higher development spending.\nTo provide clarity on operational performance and comparison to guidance and excluding the costs associated with the planned separation of Atlas the impacts from Russia in my following comments. Now let's look in more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 25.6% last year.\nAs a percent of sales, gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive impact of the Meritor acquisition and higher variable compensation expenses. Our Cummins Meritor business continued to show improvement in the second quarter and is performing in line with our expectations for the full year. In fact, most of our businesses delivered gross margin expansion in the second quarter.\nSelling, admin and our -- and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.3% of sales compared to $892 million or 13.5% last year. The increase in expenses was driven by the addition of Meritor, net of realized synergies, higher variable compensation, higher development costs as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth.\nIncome from our joint ventures was $133 million, up $38 million from a year ago due to a slow recovery in demand in China. Other income was $24 million, an improvement of $42 million from a year ago. In the second quarter last year, we incurred $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin on qualified benefit plans, and those did not repeat this year, which largely explains the change in other income.\nInterest expense increased by $65 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and also rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 22.3%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share compared to $702 million or $4.94 a year ago.\nAll-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $483 million $116 million lower than the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher working capital associated with the higher sales. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor and assumes that the operations of Atmos will be included in our consolidated results for the full year.\nSegment results and guidance exclude the costs and benefits related to the separation of the filtration business. Components revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 76%. EBITDA percent decreased from 18.2% to 14.7%, with EBITDA dollars growing from $355 million to $504 million, both the big driver of the growth in EBITDA dollars and the decline in the percent was the addition of the Meritor business, which added $1.2 billion in sales and $152 million or 12.2% of sales EBITDA.\nFor the Components segment, we expect 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, in line with our previous guidance. Within components, Meritor revenues are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion and EBITDA in the range of 10.3% to 11%, consistent with our previous guidance.\nIn the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.2% compared to 15.2% in 2022 due to higher development spending and higher variable compensation costs linked to the stronger overall performance of Cummins year-over-year.\nIn 2023, we project revenues for the engine business will increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA expected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5%, unchanged from our prior year guidance. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $2.6 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.5% and compared to 11.2% a year ago.\nWe now expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15% and EBITDA in the range of 11.7% to 12.4%. And with sales increasing 5% from our prior outlook and margins up 40 basis points, extending the track record of margin expansion in this business.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $1.5 billion, an increase of 21% and EBITDA increased by 58%. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA rose from 10.6% to 13.8% of sales, driven by higher power generation volumes and improved pricing. We have an intense focus on improving the results of the Power Systems business, and this has yielded clear margin expansion over the past year, and we see much more potential for earnings growth going forward.\nResults for the second quarter include $18 million of costs associated with actions that we have taken to drive further improvement as we seek to transform the long-term earnings power of this business. In 2023, we expect revenues for Power Systems to be up 8% to 13%, an increase of 3% from our previous outlook.\nEBITDA is now projected to be 14.3% to 15%, an increase of 60 basis points from our last forecast. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business.\nOur EBITDA loss was $114 million as we continue to invest in the product infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million, unchanged from our previous outlook. And loss is now expected to be in the range of $420 million to $440 million, an increase of $50 million in those losses as we increase the level of resources dedicated to successfully ramp up and meet growing electrolyzer demand.\nAs Jen mentioned, our full year outlook for the company is unchanged. We maintain our previous guidance with revenues expected to be up 15% to 20% and from last year and EBITDA margins in the range of 15% to 15.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items.\nCapital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior outlook. In 2023, we will continue to focus deploying cash to reinvest in our business. grow the dividend and reduce debt.\nIn summary, we delivered record solid profitability in the second quarter of 2023 with a key feature being the improvement in the gross margins in most parts of our business. In the second half of the year, focus remains the same, delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in lower carbon technologies.\nOur guidance does imply lower revenues in the second half of the year, and we will manage our operating expenses below second quarter levels accordingly. Thank you for your interest today. We delivered solid second quarter continue to make good progress in executing our strategy. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.",

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. Thank you.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident & COO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. In March, Cummins announced the launch of Accelera by Cummins, a new brand for our New Power business unit. Accelera provides a diverse portfolio of zero emission solutions for many of the world's most vital industries, empowering customers to accelerate their transition to a sustainable future. Coupled with our brand announcement, Accelera shared that it will supply a 90-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system for [ RAM's ] carbon recycling plant in Quebec, Canada. This will be the largest PEM installation in North America and a key step in advancing the green hydrogen economy.\nAccelera and Bluebird also announced -- we will increase production of electric school buses more than doubling the zero emission school buses that we've collectively put into operation over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, progress continues to be made on the planned separation of the filtration business. In February, we announced that our filtration business, Atmos Filtration Technologies filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed underwritten IPO of newly issued common stock.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continue to be strong across all of our key markets and regions with a slow improvement in China, resulting in record revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.5 billion, an increase of 32% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand and improved pricing, EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% compared to $755 million or 11.8% a year ago.\nFirst quarter 2023 results include $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business, while the first quarter of 2022 results include $158 million related to the suspension of operations in Russia, and $17 million related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these costs, EBITDA percentage increased in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, offset by supply chain and compensation cost increases. Research and development expenses also increased in the first quarter of 2023 as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volume, pricing and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases.\nAs we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023, and we will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. In the first quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of 9.4%. The improvement in profitability from the comparable EBITDA margin of 7.2% in 2022 was driven by improved pricing, operational improvements and cost reduction activities aligned with our value capture initiatives.\nOur first quarter revenues in North America grew 39% to $5.1 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 76,000 units, up 17% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 27% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 33,000 units in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022, while our unit sales were 30,000, up 13% from 2022. We shipped 39,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the first quarter of 2023, down 5% from 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 6% as volumes declined, partially offset by positive net pricing. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 14% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints began to ease.\nOur international revenues increased by 24% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 16% as on-highway markets began to recover. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 268,000 units, an increase of 2% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were $46,000, an increase of 31% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new product launches to meet NS VI standards. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2022 levels at 476,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 36,000 units, an increase of 6%.\nIndustry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 57,000 units, a decrease of 26% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to the change in emissions regulations and related adjustments and inventory levels. Our units sold were 9,000 units, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in the excavator market was offset by improved share with the new and expanded customer relationships and first quarter engine sales to replenish inventory levels at construction OEMs.\nSales of power generation equipment in China decreased 28% in the first quarter, primarily driven by a decline in data center activity. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $752 million, an increase of 21% from first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 26%, while our shipments increased 7%. Power generation revenues increased by 30% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. In Brazil, our revenues increased 48%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenue in 2023 to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 12% to 17%. This guidance reflects an improved outlook in North America, including stronger demand for Meritor. We are forecasting higher demand in heavy-duty truck and power systems markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2022. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023 compared with our prior guide of 260,000 to 280,000.\nWhile supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce, end customer demand remains strong. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. Similar to heavy duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 16% in 2023, an improvement from the previous guidance of up 7% driven by share growth better-than-expected construction volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the demand in the light-duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with the prior guide. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10%, improved from our prior guidance of a decline of 25% to 30%. While the market is adjusting to new emissions regulations, shipments to replenish inventory and export demand exceed our prior expectations.\nAs we discussed previously, our guidance assumes a slow recovery in demand in China this year. We have continued to improve our presence in the region, through the down cycle of 2022 and are well positioned for continued outgrowth. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners. We are seeing this in 2023 with improved on-highway share now that NS VI is fully implemented, along with higher share in the construction market as we expand our partnerships.\nWe also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases in the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up 1% in 2023. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with the prior guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15% driven by increases in nonresidential construction and improvement in the data center market.\nFor Accelera, we are expecting full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our prior guidance. Revenues are expected to approximately double from 2022 due to higher battery demand in North America school bus market and the additions of the electronic powertrain portion of the Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. The electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum as well with the near-term forecast on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand.\nAs mentioned on our previous call, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenue contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be between $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, an increase from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in our previous guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance.\nIn summary, coming off a very strong first quarter with visibility to strong demand beyond the first half of the year, we have raised our sales growth outlook for the year to 15% to 20%. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.7% from our previous guidance of 14.5% to 15.2%, reflecting very strong incremental margins while we continue to invest for the future within our core business and Accelera. Demand in most of our core markets is strong. Our products are performing well, and we are excited about the investments we are making in the future.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Strong execution resulted in record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in the first quarter despite the continued challenging operating environment. I'm impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our excellent results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect the planet for future generations and return cash to our shareholders.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Cummins, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter with organic revenue growth of 12%, record quarterly EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, an improved operating cash flow compared to a year ago. Given the strength of the first quarter results and improved outlook, we have raised our full year expectations for sales and profitability.\nNow let me go into some more details of the first quarter performance. Revenues were a record $8.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 39% and international revenues increased 24%. Of the total increase, 20% was driven by the addition of Meritor. Organic growth was driven by strong demand for products in all segments and improved pricing. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, including $18 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $755 million or 11.8% of sales, including $158 million of costs related to the suspension of our operations in Russia, and $17 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.\nExcluding these items, the higher EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes and improved pricing partially offset by increased investment in new products and capabilities. To provide clarity on the first quarter operational performance of our business and allow comparison to prior year and guidance and excluding the costs related to the separation of the Filtration business and the suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments.\nLet's look a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $2 billion increased $440 million but as a percent of sales decreased by 90 basis points as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive effect of Meritor. Across our businesses, we saw mixed trends on input costs with the Engine business experiencing some increases, while other segments saw some benefits in freight and commodity costs. Results for Meritor improved from prior quarters due to improved pricing and operational improvements.\nSelling, admin and research expenses increased by $191 million, driven by the addition of Meritor, higher variable compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Selling, admin and R&D decreased 110 basis points as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $119 million decreased $8 million from the prior year with higher earnings from joint ventures operations offset by lower technology fees.\nIn China, we did see higher earnings than anticipated as truck OEMs increased build rates to restock channels after a very challenging 2022. We not yet seeing signs of sustained improvement in end user demand, however. Other income was $71 million, an increase of $123 million from a year ago. The improvement in other income is driven by a gain of $19 million in mark-to-market investments compared to a loss of $37 million a year ago. We also, a year ago, we incurred an asset write-down of $36 million. Interest income and gains on foreign exchange also increased year-over-year in this line item.\nInterest expense increased by $70 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.7%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $790 million or $5.55 per diluted share, up 90% from the $418 million or $2.92 per diluted share a year ago. Our strong performance in Q1 continues our trend raising performance over successive cycles. All in, operating cash flow was an inflow of $495 million, $331 million higher than the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher earnings.\nI'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor all year, and it assumes that the operations of the Filtration business will be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs or benefits related to the separation of the Filtration business as and when that occurs. Components segment revenue was a record $3.6 billion, an increase of 79%, while EBITDA decreased from 16.4% of sales to 14.6%, primarily driven by the addition of Meritor. Meritor revenues in the first quarter in the segment were $1.3 billion and EBITDA was $120 million or 9.4% of sales, up from last quarter and in line with our expectations. Components, we expect total 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37%, up 4% from prior year guidance and EBIT margin to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, unchanged from 3 months ago.\nFor the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were a record $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 15.3% flat with a year ago as the benefit from pricing was offset by higher material and variable compensation expenses. In 2023, we expect revenues for the Engine business to grow between 2% and 7%, up 2% at the midpoint from our prior guide, driven by continued strength in the North American truck market and a lower pace of deceleration in the China construction market. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% of sales flat with previous guidance. And our overall projections for the Engine business include a modest tapering in both the top line and the bottom line in the fourth quarter.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to a record $2.4 billion. EBITDA also increased to 13.9% of sales compared to 9.9% a year ago, driven by higher volumes in both whole goods and aftermarket as well as improved net pricing. We expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10% and EBITDA margins in the range of 11.3% to 12%, and we've raised our guidance for sales by 3% at the midpoint and margins by 100 basis points.\nIn the Power Systems business, we also had a strong quarter with the revenues of $1.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA increased from 9.5% to 16.3% and of sales driven by higher volumes, strong parts business and higher pricing. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 5% to 10%, consistent with our prior year guidance. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 13.7% to 14.4%, an increase of 70 basis points from our prior projections. Accelera revenues more than doubled to [ $85 million ], driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market, and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $94 million as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate Accelera revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses to be in the range of $380 million at the midpoint, entirely consistent with our projections from 3 months ago.\nAs Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions and end markets, we are raising full year company guidance. We now project 2023 company revenues to be up 15% to 20%, a 3% increase from our prior guidance. Company EBITDA margins are now expected to be approximately 15% to 15.7%, up 50 basis points from our prior projections. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior forecast as we continue to make the critical investments necessary to bring to market new products and capacity expansion to support future growth.\nWe remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash to shareholders over time. And as we said last time, in 2023, our primary focus will be on dividends and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt for this year, whilst we continue to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.\nIn summary, we delivered record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in a very strong first quarter. Our customers are indicating stronger visibility into the second half of the year, giving us confidence to raise our forecast. We will continue to focus on delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies.\nThere is 1 last matter I would like to bring to your attention. You will see in our Form 10-Q to be filed later today that we have updated our risk factor disclosure related to our ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB on their review of our emission systems, most notably our pickup truck applications. We understand that these agencies are likely to propose resolving this matter by requesting in the relatively near future that we agree to 1 or more consent decrees and pay certain civil penalties. We are not able to estimate the amount of these penalties today, but we anticipate that the amount is likely to be material. We look forward to providing additional information on this topic when we reach a resolution.\nThank you for joining us today, and now I'll turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.",

Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP of IR, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the full year performance.\nParticipating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of 2022, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year.\nLast year was an incredibly exciting one for Cummins and our stakeholders. We made significant strides in our inorganic growth strategy, most notably through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. We also navigated complex global supply chain challenges, advanced our preparation for the separation of our Filtration business and transition from Tom to me as the CEO. We accomplished all of this and delivered record revenues, EBITDA and earnings per share in 2022.\nWe did so with a focus on the exciting opportunity in front of us to lead the industry to a broader clean economy and do so in a way that is best for our stakeholders and the planet. Decarbonization is a growth opportunity for Cummins, uniting our business and climate goals. In 2022, we launched our long-term decarbonization growth strategy, Destination Zero, which includes making meaningful reductions in carbon emissions through advanced internal combustion technologies widely accepted by the market today, while continuing to invest in and advance zero emission technologies ahead of widespread market adoption.\nAs part of our organic growth strategy, we unveiled the industry's first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms, and we continue to see momentum in our electrolyzer technology and green hydrogen production opportunities. Demand for our products remain strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter revenues totaled $7.8 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand in many of our North American market.\nTo provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I'm excluding the Meritor operating results and associated acquisition and integration costs. The costs related to the separation of the Filtration business and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. Mark will provide more detail on the reported results in his comments.\nWith these exclusions considered, EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% of sales in Q4, above our guidance of 15.5% and stronger than the $705 million or 12.1% reported a year ago. EBITDA and EBITDA percentage improved due to an increase in gross margins with positive pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage cost and some improvement in logistics costs, all of which offset increases in material costs.\nGross margin improvement is key to meeting our long-term goals of increasing the returns in our core business while transitioning our new power business to break even EBITDA by 2027.\nIn the fourth quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement, and we continue to accelerate value capture opportunities across the business. Our employees have done an excellent job in integrating the Meritor operations and people within Cummins and continue to make strides in identifying cost reduction opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $130 million in pretax synergies we referenced upon completion of the acquisition. And in addition, we expect to deliver incremental tax synergies as we integrate the business.\nExcluding Meritor, 2022 revenues were a record $26.2 billion, 9% higher than 2021. Also excluding Meritor, the costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business and the impact of the indefinite suspension of our Russia operations, full year EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% of sales compared to $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales in 2021.\nImproved volumes, better price realization and an improved supply chain environment more than offset higher compensation expenses, increased material costs and lower joint venture income for the year. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in Engine, Power Systems, Distribution and Components segments.\nLeading the way was the Components segment, which delivered 150 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. The Power Systems business finished 2022 with another solid quarter and delivered full year EBITDA of 12.2%, up from 11.2% last year. The improvement in performance in this segment over the past 6 months is encouraging, and you will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year.\nEBITDA margins in the distribution business increased by 110 basis points. Our reported full year 2022 results include 5 months of operational performance for Meritor or $1.9 billion of revenue and $26 million of EBITDA, including $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting-related costs.\nNow let me provide our overall outlook for 2023 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2023 guidance includes our expected results of the Meritor business and excludes the cost or benefits associated with the separation of the Filtration business. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2023 to increase 12% to 17% compared to 2022 and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales, driven by the inclusion of a full year of sales from Meritor, continued strength in the North American truck market, improved demand in power generation markets, overall pricing improvement and slow improvement in the China on-highway markets.\nIndustry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2023, a range of a 5% decline to 2% improvement year-over-year. In medium-duty truck, we expect the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units flat to up 10% from 2022. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market as the engine partnerships we announced in 2021 continue to phase in.\nOur engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 7% in 2023. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in demand in the light-duty truck market coming off the low market levels in 2022.\nIndustry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% to 35% in 2023 as the market adjust to new emissions regulations and digest the inventory on hand. We are watching the situation in China closely with ensuring the safety and well-being of our people as our first priority. The change in the country's COVID lockdown policy could positively impact our operations in the coming months. The current events make it difficult to gauge. The markets within China are at a low point as we close out 2022, and our guidance assumes a slow recovery in 2023.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up 1% in 2023. We expect the industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5% dependent upon the trajectory of commodity prices and supply chain improvement.\nDemand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15% driven by increases in nonresidential construction and improvements in the data center market.\nIn New Power, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, more than doubling our 2022 revenues. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to convert to backlog and to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2022, we shared that we had reached the milestone of $100 million in electrolyzer backlog. This tripled to $300 million at the end of 2022, demonstrating the strong momentum in this market. With demand continuing to rise, we are focused on adding capacity for electrolyzer production.\nDuring 2022, we announced several capacity expansion investments and expect to have more than 2 gigawatts of scalable capacity in the 2024 to 2025 time frame across Europe, North America and China. Additionally, we will continue to deliver battery electric and fuel cell systems, along with electric powertrain technologies as adoption continues in the transportation market.\nAs mentioned, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. We are continuing to drive improvement in our margins post acquisition and expect Meritor to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment.\nWithin components, we expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue in 2023 with EBITDA margins in the range of 10.3% to 11%, an improvement from the comparable 2022 EBITDA margin of 7.2%.\nThe electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business has been integrated within the New Power portfolio with projected 2023 EBITDA losses of $55 million included in the overall guidance for that segment. In 2023, we anticipate that demand will remain strong in most of our key regions and markets, especially in the first half of the year. While some macroeconomic indicators have weakened in recent months, we have not seen a significant change in customer orders at this time.\nIn summary, we expect full year sales growth of 12% to 17% and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales. We have taken a number of actions to improve our EBITDA in 2023 and expect to generate very strong incremental margins within our core business and improve the margins of the Meritor business while continuing to invest in our New Power business. Having effectively managed through the challenges of the past couple of years, we expect improved performance in 2023 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nCFO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There are 4 key takeaways from my comments today. First, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding our own projections for revenue and EBITDA from 3 months ago, and we delivered stronger margins in engines, components, distribution and power systems compared to a year ago.\nSecond, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Meritor, and we remain on track to deliver $130 million of pretax synergies by the end of year 3. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, demand for our products remain strong, supporting increased revenues in our core business and New Power and growth in EBITDA and earnings per share in 2023.\nNow let me go into more details on the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $7.8 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 14.2%. For the full year, revenues were $28.1 billion and EBITDA of $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales.\nAlso in the fourth quarter, Meritor generated $1.2 billion of revenue, $60 million of EBITDA after incurring $27 million of acquisition and integration-related costs. Our fourth quarter results also included $19 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business.\nFull year 2022 results included 5 months of operational performance for Meritor, yielding $1.9 billion of revenue, $26 million of EBITDA, reflecting $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting-related costs. We'll all look forward to a cleaner set of numbers in 2023.\nOur full year 2022 results also included $81 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business, and $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I am excluding the Meritor results and the separation of Filtration and the indefinite suspension of Russia in my following comments. But hopefully, you're clear after my earlier remarks about the magnitude of those -- each of those items.\nFourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 25%, driven by continued strong demand in truck markets. International revenues decreased 1%, with strong demand for power generation and mining equipment in most markets offset by declines in China and of course, the impact of our suspension of our operations in Russia.\nCurrency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar. EBITDA is $1.1 billion or 16.1% compared to $705 million or 12.1% a year ago. EBITDA increased by $359 million due mainly to improved pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage expenses, all of which contributed to stronger gross margin performance and more than offset higher material costs.\nNow let's go into our income statement a little more detailed by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 26.3% of sales increased by $420 million or 380 basis points from a year ago. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $52 million, up 6% due to higher compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth particularly in the Engines and New Power segments.\nJoint venture income decreased $28 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $44 million, an increase of $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher pension income. Interest expense increased $58 million largely driven by the financing costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor.\nThe all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, including $52 million or $0.36 per diluted share favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $631 million or $4.43 per diluted share, up from $394 million or $2.73 a year ago.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $817 million, including Meritor and, $85 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by higher earnings. For the full year '22, revenues were a record $26.2 billion or up 9% from a year ago, with sales in North America up 18% and international revenues down 2%.\nCurrency movements negatively impacted revenues for the full year by 2%. EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% for 2022 compared to $3.5 billion of 14.7% of sales a year ago. Improvements in components, distribution, power systems and engine margins were partially offset by increased investment in New Power and more than $100 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin some of our nonqualified benefit plans. All of that run through our operating EBITDA.\nAll-in net earnings were $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share compared to $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion primarily due to higher inventory levels.\nCapital expenditures in 2022 were $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021 as we continue to invest in new products and capacity expansion critical for future growth. We returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 63% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends last year.\nNow moving on to our guidance for 2023, which includes Meritor, and thankfully, reduces the number of exclusions we'll have to explain each quarter, and I appreciate your patience as we work through that in 2022. We are excluding any separation costs associated with Filtration, and for now, we're assuming that the operating results of Filtration are in our guidance for the full year 2023, as the timing of that separation is not yet determined.\nWe expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenue in 2023. We currently project 2023 company revenues, including Meritor, to be up 12% to 17% and company-wide EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.2%. In '23, we expect revenues for the Engine business will be flat to up 5%, driven by continued strength in North American truck market and a modest recovery in China.\n2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% compared to 14.4% in 2022. We expect distribution revenues this year to be up 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% compared to 10.5% in 2022. Including Meritor, we expect 2023 components revenues to increase 28% to 33% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8% compared to 15.0% in 2022.\nIn '23, we also expect Power Systems revenues to be up 5% to 10% due to higher demand for oil and gas engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA there is projected to be between 13% and 13.7%, up from 12.2% of sales last year. And also this year, we expect New Power revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million. We expect New Power net losses to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million as we continue to make targeted investments in capacity, technology to support growing customer demand. Our goal remains to achieve breakeven EBITDA in 2027.\nOur effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 22%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time and have accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% goal when we have generated more cash than required to support our strategy.\nIn 2023, we will prioritize cash towards dividends and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor while continuing to invest to deliver future profitable growth. Having a strong balance sheet is an important asset as we navigate through economic cycles and sustain our investments in new products for existing and new markets.\nTo summarize, we delivered record sales, strong full year earnings in 2022, while managing through supply chain challenges and a very weak demand environment in China. As we move through 2023, demand for our products remains strong in most of our core markets with good visibility into the first half of the year. We'll continue to focus on raising margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, generating strong cash flow and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies and penetrate new markets through our New Power business.\nThank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP of IR, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. (Operator Instructions)\nOperator, we're ready for our first question.",

Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP of IR, Cummins Inc.\n\n(technical difficulty) and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.\nMore information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement, in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, and Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region and I'll finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the details of our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the third quarter. On August 3, Cummins completed the acquisition of Meritor, a leading global supplier of drivetrain, mobility, braking, aftermarket and electric powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The integration of Meritor's people, products and capabilities in axle and brake technology will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across the internal combustion and electric power applications.\nWe've been excited to welcome our new colleagues into our company. The company announced several collaborations that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals and advance our Destination Zero strategy. During the third quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Werner Enterprises, Transport Enterprise Leasing and Versatile to deliver 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines when available. The X15H hydrogen engine, part of Cummins' fuel-agnostic platform, will enable a more timely solution to reduce carbon emissions by providing customers with an option that has powertrain installation commonality and end-user familiarity.\nThe New Power business continued to expand its green hydrogen presence globally as demand continues to rise in the key markets of North America, Europe and China. Cummins announced it will expand PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium factory to 1 gigawatt. The company also announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring our continued dedication to advancing the nation's green hydrogen economy. Electrolyzer production will take place at our Fridley, Minnesota facility, starting at 500 megawatts of manufacturing capacity annually and scalable to 1 gigawatt in the future.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress in preparing for the separation of our Filtration business. The addition of Meritor and the planned separation of the Filtration business are positive moves for our future. However, there are upfront costs associated with both transactions, which you can see from our press release and earnings materials, heavily influenced our reported results this quarter. We expect that the most significant costs associated with both transactions are behind us, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remains strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the third quarter. Third quarter revenues totaled $7.3 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, third quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 11% from the same quarter in 2021.\nEBITDA in the third quarter was $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results and the $25 million related acquisition and integration costs, EBITDA was $907 million or 13.8% of sales compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. Third quarter results include costs of $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. Adjusting for these costs, EBITDA without Meritor and Filtration costs was $923 million or 14% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the results of Meritor, the costs associated with its acquisition and the costs associated with the expected separation of our Filtration business.\nOur EBITDA percentage declined in the third quarter for 3 main reasons: first, we saw a 32% drop in joint venture income from the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in the China markets; second, we increased investments in research and development as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create competitive advantage in the future, particularly in the Engine and New Power segments; and finally, we made an investment in our people through a onetime bonus in recognition of their intense work and commitment to meet customer demand and navigate supply chain and other challenges. This bonus did not apply to company officers. A motivated and highly effective workforce is critical to delivering our customers, executing on our strategy and to creating shareholder value, and this bonus will pay dividends over time in the retention and engagement of our people.\nWe continue to make positive progress in improving gross margins of our business and offsetting the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we have experienced since the start of 2021. Gross margin percentage improved in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2021 as the benefit of higher volumes and pricing exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and material cost increases and higher product coverage costs during the quarter.\nOur third quarter revenues in North America grew 19% to $4 billion, driven by improved pricing, higher volumes and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 64,000 units, up 23% from 2021 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 25,000, up 15% from 2021. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 29,000 units in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 26% from 2021 levels, while our unit sales were up 27,000, up 20% from 2021.\nWe shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2022, down 4% from 2021 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 16% over 2021 due to strong capital spending by rental companies and pricing. Power Systems North America sales were up 30% compared to 2021, driven by higher volumes and strength in aftermarket. Power Systems North America industrial sales were up 122% compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by strong oil and gas demand. North America power generation sales also increased by 10% from the third quarter of 2021.\nOur international revenues decreased by 1% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 18% due to lower sales in on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 164,000 units, a decrease of 25% from 2021. Weaker new vehicle demand, contracted property investment and economic impacts from the shutdowns as the country continues to respond to the COVID-19 outbreaks have pushed the market to the lowest level in a decade instead of our projected recovery of the market in the second half of the year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 30,000, a decrease of 27%.\nThe light-duty market in China decreased 8% from 2021 levels to 387,000 units in the third quarter, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 24,000, a decrease of 30%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 57,000 units, an increase of 3% from 2021 levels. And our units sold were 7,800 units, a decrease of 8%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 29% in the third quarter due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.\nThird quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $614 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 37%, while our shipments increased 20%, lagging the industry production due to the lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. Demand for power generation increased in the third quarter as economic activity continued to improve, resulting in record revenue in the quarter for that market.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. To provide clarity in our projections, we will first provide guidance excluding the results of Meritor from the acquisition date through the end of 2022. We will then provide a view of the expected Meritor results for 2022.\nBased on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a continued weak market outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021.\nEBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15% of sales, excluding the Meritor results and costs associated with acquisition and integration, the cost of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our Filtration business. This is below our previous guidance of approximately 15.5% of sales as a result of the lower-than-expected market in China in the second half of 2022 and the onetime employee bonus investment made in the third quarter. This guidance reflects our expectations of increased profitability in the fourth quarter as we continue to drive the improvements we've seen throughout the year on pricing relative to inflationary costs and improve our operating efficiency.\nBased on our current forecast, we expect production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to be at 260,000 units in 2022, a 15% increase year-over-year. The supply chain constraints in our industry is expected to continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet the sustained strong end customer demand.\nIn North America, medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021, consistent with prior guidance. In China, we now project total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 25% to 30% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 20% to 25%. We now project a 55% reduction in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% to 20% reduction in demand in the light-duty truck market compared to a 50% decline and 15% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance.\nIndustry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China, we have continued to improve our presence in the region through the down cycle and are well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. As we look ahead, industry volume of NS VI product will continue to increase as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition, with our NS VI share continuing to run ahead of our NS V share. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 15% to 20% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 15%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022. Strong performance in power generation within India is also contributing to this improved outlook. Most major global high-horsepower markets are expected to remain strong through the end of 2022. Sales of mining engines are now expected to be up 5% compared to the prior year, an improvement from our previous guidance of flat. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120%, consistent with our prior guidance. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets amid energy insecurity has fueled this strong outlook.\nRevenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction. This is an increase from our prior guidance of up 5%, driven by the increased production of supply chain constraints slightly eased and improved pricing. We are projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021, consistent with our previous estimate. This strong outlook is driven by parts demand within our North America on-highway business as well as global Power Systems markets.\nIn New Power, we expect full year sales to be approximately $180 million, down from our previous guidance of $200 million due to customer scheduling and supply chain impacts. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And we are seeing increased momentum in North America following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with customers on both electrified power and fuel cell applications in 2022. This was demonstrated in the third quarter as we successfully launched the Cummins HD120 fuel cell System in China by delivering 52 units to the Lin-gang government for a bus application.\nFor Meritor, we are expecting full year revenue since the date of acquisition to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 4.5% of sales during the same period, including the impact of required purchase accounting and integration costs. This represents the financial impact of Meritor across our Components and New Power businesses.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $245 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. As I sum up the third quarter, I want to emphasize that we are making progress in our strategy to lead in decarbonizing our industry. Although profitability dropped from the second quarter levels, the fundamentals of our business have not changed. Our products are performing well, leading to record demand from customers and rising market share in some of our core markets. This is a direct result of the contribution from our outstanding workforce.\nI do want to acknowledge the clear improvement in the financial performance of Power Systems business this quarter, and I'm enthusiastic about the prospects for future earnings growth. We do expect total company profitability to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels, as implied in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are committed to improving the underlying financial performance of our business and delivering strong incremental margins through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nCFO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There were a number of factors that impacted our reported results in the third quarter, and I will step through them to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the company and allow for comparison to our prior guidance. But the key takeaway I want you to leave with is that the fundamentals of our business remain strong.\nAs you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August and are actively working through the business integration. Our third quarter results included 2 months of operational performance for the Meritor business, resulting in $737 million of sales and a total EBITDA loss of $23 million, which includes both the impact of purchase accounting and acquisition and integration costs. Our third quarter results also included $16 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. To provide clarity on the operational performance of our business, excluding the acquisition in comparison to our prior guidance, I am excluding the impact of these items in my following comments.\nNow let me get into more detail on our third quarter performance. Revenues were $6.6 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 19% while international revenues decreased 1%, driven by the decline in China, the impact of the suspension of our operations in Russia and the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced our reported sales by 3%.\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results, acquisition and integration costs and the costs associated with the separation of Filtration, EBITDA was $923 million or 14% of sales for the quarter compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by an increase in engineering support, engineering spend to support new product development, weaker joint venture earnings in China and the onetime bonus to recognize the commitment of our employees. This onetime bonus totaled $56 million and impacted the reported results of all operating segments, with $41 million of those costs reported within gross margin and $15 million reported within selling, admin and research costs.\nNow let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.6 billion or 24.7% of sales increased by $213 million or 100 basis points compared to last year due to the benefits from stronger volumes and higher pricing, which more than offset higher material and people costs. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $110 million or 13%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting the development of products critical to achieving our Destination Zero strategy, including the fuel-agnostic engine platform, battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and PEM electrolyzer technologies.\nJoint venture income declined by $30 million compared to last year, primarily driven by lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $10 million, $22 million lower than a year ago, driven by $29 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our qualified benefit plans. And this compared to a gain on those investments of $1 million a year ago. Interest expense increased by $33 million due primarily to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $468 million or $3.30 per diluted share, down from $534 million or $3.69 a year ago, with the decrease primarily attributed to an increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.7%, including $57 million or $0.40 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete items primarily related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $569 million in Q3 of last year.\nNow let me comment on the segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 8% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, and EBITDA decreased from 15.2% to 13.1% of sales as the benefits of pricing were more than offset by higher manufacturing and product coverage costs and lower joint venture income in China. For the full year 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 14.25%, a decrease from our previous guidance of 14.5% due to a weaker outlook in China and the impact of the onetime employee bonus.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 10% compared to 9.8% a year ago due to pricing and stronger demand for parts, engines and power generation equipment. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to last year, in line with our prior guidance. EBIT is now expected to be approximately 10.5% of sales, consistent with our prior projection.\nComponents revenue increased 10% in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA increased from 14.1% of sales to 16.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions and lower warranty expense. We expect full year revenues to increase 3% and project EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be approximately 16.75%, unchanged from our view 3 months ago. Clearly, the Components segment results are most impacted by the acquisition of Meritor, and I just want to underline that the performance excluding the addition of Meritor was exactly in line with our guidance for the quarter and for the full year.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 16% in the third quarter to $1.3 billion, a record for the segment. EBITDA increased from 11.5% to 14.3% due to higher volumes, strong price realization and the increased demand for aftermarket parts. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 8%. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11.25%, also up from our prior guidance of 11%, driven by stronger price realization and continued strength in sales.\nIn the New Power segment, revenues were $45 million, up 96% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. For the full year 2022, we expect New Power revenues to be up approximately $180 million, down slightly from our prior guidance of $200 million due to delays in some customer projects and some supply chain constraints. Underlying demand, however, continues to grow for both battery electric systems and electrolyzers. Net expense for this segment is now projected to be $310 million compared to our prior guidance of $290 million, driven by increased investment to scale up electrolyzer production capacity and bring new products to market.\nAs Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our 2022 expectations of total company revenues to be up 8%, and we now expect our EBITDA margins at approximately 15% for the full year. To be clear, once again, that this guidance excludes the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, the impact of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and any expenses associated with preparing for the separation of the Filtration business. This guidance does imply an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect earnings from joint ventures to decline by 25% to 30% in 2022 due to the ongoing weakness in China and the impact of suspension of our business in Russia, and that is slightly worse than our prior guidance of down 25%, all due to the conditions in China. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% in 2022, lots of 22s there, excluding any discrete items, an increase from our prior guidance of 21.5%.\nExcluding Meritor, our capital expenditures in the quarter were $179 million, up from $150 million a year ago, and we're maintaining our full year guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. We returned $245 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the third quarter, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year 2022, we still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAnd as I've already mentioned, we expect the Meritor revenues to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for the 5 months of this year under our ownership, and EBITDA to be approximately 4.5%, including the impact of purchase accounting.\nIn closing, I want to again reinforce that Cummins is in a strong position, growing our leadership in our core markets while setting up the company for a stronger future through investment in new products and capabilities. And we are adjusting our portfolio of businesses, all while returning cash to shareholders. We do expect to deliver stronger profitability in the fourth quarter as implied in our full year guidance. Thank you for your guidance today -- no, your interest today. My guidance, your interest. Thank you. Now let me turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP of IR, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. (Operator Instructions). Operator, we are ready for our first question.",

Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2022. Participating with me today are Tom Linebarger, our Executive Chairman; Jen Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the risk factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Executive Chairman, Tom Linebarger one more time. Thanks.\n\nN. Thomas Linebarger\n\nExecutive Chairman, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Brilliant. Good morning, everybody.\nI just -- I had to start by telling you about some rough math I did before I walked in today. And I believe this is my 70th earnings call. It's also going to be my last. I'm very grateful to the analysts and investors who are part of this journey with me. Many of you help me better understand the perspective of our shareholders, which influenced how we ran the company, how we developed our strategies and priorities, and how we communicated about our results and plans for the future. I always try to ensure that the senior leaders in the company understood your views and perspectives, and they understood who they were really working for. Some of you have been at this work almost as long as I have, and your commitment to understanding our company and its potential has been remarkable. I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.\nI'm very proud to have served as the CEO for this company for 10 years, as a senior executive for more than 20 years. It was an honor and a privilege. This company stands for more than its products and technology, its revenue or its earnings, and even its performance for customers all over the world. The people that work here are exceptional humans, not just exceptional workers. That's why this transition was so important to me. It is perhaps the most important work of my entire career. And I have a smile a mile wide today because of the quality of the individual that replaces me and the strength of the team beneath her.\nJennifer Rumsey is a once in a generation leader. She combines the leadership and technical skills needed, with the characters and values required and the inspiration of a CEO that can take this company to places where I could not. I'm as proud as I was on the day I took the job to see her succeed me. Jen?\n\nJennifer W. Rumsey\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Good morning. I'm excited to join you this morning in this new capacity as President and CEO for Cummins.\nIn July, we announced that Tom would end his term as CEO effective August 1. It is a bittersweet moment for me as he's been one of the most significant influences in my career and leadership. Tom has been an incredible leader for this company and a true partner and coach to me. Because of his leadership, we are in a strong position to navigate what comes next and execute our Destination Zero strategy. Tom and I share a common vision for Cummins and the role that our company plays empowering a more prosperous world. I feel deeply honored and proud to serve as the new CEO of Cummins, the first woman and just the seventh CEO of this great company. My life and leadership have prepared me for this role at this moment during the critical period for Cummins and our planet. A focus on purpose, people and impact has shaped my career and will influence how I lead. I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward.\nI'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. And I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the detail on our performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter. The company achieved significant milestones related to 2 previously announced acquisitions: Jacobs Vehicle Systems, or JVS, and Meritor. In April, Cummins completed the acquisition of JVS, adding engine braking, cylinder deactivation, start-stop control and thermal management technologies, which are key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations. On May 26, Meritor's shareholders voted in favor of the Cummins acquisition bid, further validating the potential of what Cummins and Meritor can achieve together. The companies are working together to complete the acquisition this week as we have received all regulatory approvals to close the transaction.\nDuring the second quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Daimler Truck, North America and Scania to deliver fuel cell electric powertrains for heavy-duty truck applications and with Komatsu on development of zero-emission haulage equipment, including hydrogen fuel cell solutions for large mining haul truck applications. Cummins, Chevron and Walmart also share plans to integrate Cummins X15N natural gas engines, powered by renewable natural gas into Walmart's heavy-duty truck fleet.\nThese customer collaborations are significant steps in alignment with our Destination Zero strategy to evolve our company, our products and our customers' products to the technologies needed for a decarbonized world. This strategy, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Cummins, includes reducing carbon emissions now by making improvements in engine-based solutions that are broadly available today while rapidly advancing the 0 emissions technologies of the future.\nWe continue to focus on our people and their development as a strategic advantage for the company. In the second quarter, the company posted its first human capital management report, detailing our commitment to creating and maintaining a dynamic and exciting work environment for our employees.\nNow I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions, with the notable exception of China, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the second quarter of 2021. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16% compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. Second quarter results included costs of $29 million related to the preparations for the separation of the Filtration business.\nAs discussed previously, we recorded a charge of $158 million in the first quarter related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. In the second quarter, received certain inventory and other expense amounts reserved previously and incurred some small additional charges, resulting in a net recovery of $47 million. Adjusting for these items, EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the financial impact of the suspension of our Russia operations and the costs associated with the separation of our Filtration business.\nEBITDA percentage declined in the second quarter as strength in sales and increased gross margin were offset by a 31% drop in joint venture income from the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in China markets. Research and development expenses also increased slightly in the second quarter of 2022 as we continued to invest in products and technologies that will create advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segment. Gross margin percentage improved compared to second quarter of 2021 as the benefit of pricing and higher volumes exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and materials cost increases during the quarter. This pricing only partially offset the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we carried through from 2021 and experienced in the first half of 2022.\nOur second quarter revenues in North America grew 15% to $4 billion, driven by improved pricing, higher volumes and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 62,000 units, up 9% from 2021 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, up 12% from 2021. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 30,000 units in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% from the 2021 levels, while our unit sales were 27,000, up 21% from 2021. We shipped 38,000 engines to (inaudible) for the use on the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2022, down 9% from 2021 levels due to supply chain issues, which temporarily limited truck production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 9% as other companies maintained strong capital spending.\nPower Systems North America sales were flat compared to 2021 as strength in aftermarket offset lower volumes. Demand remains high in North America markets for Power Systems, but revenues for North America power generation declined by 3% as supply chain constraints limited our production for both U.S. military and mobile power applications. Our international revenues decreased by 2% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 43% due to lower sales in the on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 173,000 units, a decrease of 70% from 2021. Last year's numbers were strong, supported by a prebuy ahead of NS VI. But weaker new vehicle demand and economic impacts from shutdowns as the country is responding to a COVID-19 resurgence have pushed the market to the lowest level since 2007.\nOur sales and units, including joint ventures, were 25,000, a decrease of 70% despite the very difficult environment in China. We did see growth in some of our power systems markets, particularly mining and oil and gas. The light-duty market in China decreased 38% from 2021 levels to 380,000 units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 23,000, a decrease of 40%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 66,000 units, a decrease of 32% from 2021 levels. The decrease was driven by declining demand within the property market and the COVID-19 impact on infrastructure demand. Our units sold were 9,900 units, a decrease of 41%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 5% in the second quarter due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.\nSecond quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were a record $594 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 131%, while our shipments increased 78%, lagging the industry production due to lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. The high level of growth in the second quarter is coming off a very low base when India was experiencing a COVID-19 peak in 2021. Demand for power generation and construction equipment increased in the second quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenue increased 7%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a weaker market outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021.\nWe are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 250,000 units to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase over a year ago. The supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are now projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021, an update to our previous guidance down 5%.\nIn China, we are now projecting total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 20% to 25% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 10%. We now project a 50% reduction in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market compared to a 40% decline and a 12% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance.\nDespite the difficult economic and market environment in China, we have significantly improved our presence and profitability in the region compared to private -- prior cycles and are well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. As an illustration from 2019 to 2022, the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is projected to be down 40%, while across the same period, we are forecasting an increase in earnings from joint ventures in China.\nAs we look ahead, industry volume of NF VI product will increase through 2022 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to continue to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 10%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022.\nWe continue to project most major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat in 2022 compared to the prior year, consistent with previous guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120%, an update from our previous guidance of up 95%. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets have fueled this improved outlook.\nRevenue in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction, consistent with our prior guidance. We are now projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021, an improvement from our previous estimate of up 15%. This is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business as well as global Power Systems markets.\nIn New Power, we continue to expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with OEMs on both electrified power and fuel cells for applications in 2022 as highlighted by the announcements I noted previously.\nWe are maintaining our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance of approximately 15.5%, excluding the impacts of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business and the expected costs associated with the pending acquisition of Meritor. We expect to deliver the strong profitability despite the supply chain constraints and rising inflationary costs that we are experiencing.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $240 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. Strong execution resulted in record sales in the quarter despite very difficult operating environment. The ongoing supply chain constraints and rising costs throughout the industry, continued COVID-19-related impacts and the effect of the conflict in Ukraine all present challenges to operating our business.\nI am grateful for the commitment of our employees across the organization who have worked tirelessly to overcome these challenges. Their efforts resulted in a strong quarter, enabling us to support our customers while generating solid returns.\nCummins is in an excellent position to continue to execute our Destination Zero strategy, invest in the products and technologies that will fund future growth and drive advantage for our customers. We will accomplish this while generating strong financial results and meeting our commitment to return cash to shareholders. It's an exciting time to become CEO.\nThank you for joining us today. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nCFO & VP, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone.\nWe delivered strong results in the second quarter, especially in the context of a challenging global business environment. As Jen mentioned, our second quarter results included a $47 million benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.\nTo provide clarity on operational performance, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items in my comments. We have provided a breakdown of the costs associated with Russia and the filtration separation costs by line item and by segment in our earnings material to help you understand the underlying performance more clearly.\nNow let me go into more details on the second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues of $6.6 billion were up 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 15%, while international revenues declined by 2% due to a sharp slowdown in China. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by negative other income and lower joint venture earnings in China. Gross margins improved year-over-year and from the first quarter.\nNow let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 25.6% of sales increased by $208 million or 140 basis points. The benefits of stronger volumes and higher pricing more than offset higher freight and material costs for this quarter. Of course, we have been facing increased costs for an extended period of time. And now our gross margins have returned back to 2019 of pre-COVID levels. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $16 million or 2%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting future growth, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.\nJoint venture income declined by $42 million versus a year ago. Lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China was the primary driver of the decline in earnings. Other income was a negative $18 million, $87 million worse than a year ago. We experienced $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans in the second quarter, and this compares to gains of $20 million a year ago. This variation in this one category explains most of the change in other income.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $678 million or $4.77 per diluted share compared to $600 million or $4.10 from a year ago. The earnings per share increased due to higher earnings, lower taxes and a reduced share count resulting from share repurchase activity. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.3%, including $36 million or $0.25 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $599 million compared to $616 million a year ago.\nI will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased 11% from a year ago, while EBITDA decreased from 16.1% of sales to 15.2% of sales, as the benefits of stronger volumes and pricing actions in our consolidated earnings were more than offset by lower joint venture income in China. In 2022, we expect the revenues to be up 10%, up 2% from our prior guidance. The increase in sales primarily driven by higher demand for engines and parts in North America. 2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 14.5%, in line with our prior guidance.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 17% from a year ago to $2.3 billion, a record quarter for the segment. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.2% compared to 10.5% sales a year ago, primarily due to stronger parts, whole goods, and sales and pricing actions. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% year-over-year and EBITDA margins in the range of 10.5% of sales, both in line with our prior guidance.\nComponents segment revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter, primarily driven by weaker demand in China. EBITDA increased from 15.1% of sales to 18.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions which offset material cost increases and lower warranty expense. We expect revenues to increase 3% for the year, down from an increase of 6% in our prior guidance, primarily to a lower outlook in China. EBITDA margin is expected to be 16.75% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 5% and EBITDA decreased from 12.2% to 10.6% of sales, as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing were more than offset by higher material and logistics expenses. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8% and EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11% for Power Systems, unchanged from our prior year guidance.\nIn the New Power segment, revenues were $42 million, up 75% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $80 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the products infrastructure and capabilities to support future growth and was in line with our expectations. In 2022, we still expect revenues for the New Power business to be approximately $200 million, up 72%. And net EBITDA losses are still expected to be in the range of $290 million for New Power, also unchanged from our prior guidance.\nAs Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our '22 expectations of company revenues to be up 8% and our EBITDA margins of approximately 15.5% of sales. This guidance excludes expenses outside of the normal course of business associated with the separation of the Filtration business, the pending acquisition of Meritor or the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline 25% in 2022, excluding the impact of suspension of our business in Russia. And this is down from our prior guide of a decline of 20% due to continued weakness -- or further weakness, in fact, in the China truck market. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for this year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were $147 million in the quarter, up from $125 million a year ago. We still expect that our full year capital investments will be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.\nWe returned $240 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns of $758 million for the first half of the year. We still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. While high inflation and rising global interest rates present risks to global economic growth, we did not experience any significant changes in aggregate demand from our customers over the past quarter. Our focus remains on raising financial performance cycle-over-cycle in our core business, while investing in technologies that will deliver future profitable growth, including in new markets, new applications and with new customers.\nWe continue to advance our strategy in the second quarter, delivered record quarterly revenues and earnings per share, and recently announced an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the 13th straight year of dividend increases.\nThank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we're ready for our first question.",

Thank you. You may begin.\n\nChristopher Clulow\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2022. Participating with me today are Tom Linebarger, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.\nBefore we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.\nMore information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.\nWith that out of the way, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger, to kick us off.\n\nN. Thomas Linebarger\n\nChairman & CEO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, then I'll discuss our sales and end market trends by region and I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.\nBefore getting into the detail on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. The company announced 2 significant acquisitions, to expand our product portfolio and are critical to advancing our decarbonization goals. The acquisition of Jacobs Vehicle Systems and the definitive agreement to acquire Meritor.\nJacob Vehicle Systems is a supplier of engine braking, cylinder deactivation, start-stop control and thermal management technologies, which are key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations.\nThe integration of Meritor, a global leader of drivetrain mobility, braking and electric powertrain solutions for commercial vehicle and industrial markets, will position Cummins as one of the few companies able to provide integrated powertrain solutions across the full range of power technologies, including combustion engines, battery electric and fuel cell electric systems.\nIn February, Cummins also unveiled the industry's first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms. This technology approach to our new engines will be applied across Cummins' X-Series, L-Series and B-Series product platforms that will help fleets reduce carbon emissions today by enabling vehicles to run on low to zero carbon fuels. The platforms will utilize the leading engine technology that customers are familiar with and have a high level of parts commonality across fuel types to reduce costs and complexity.\nAlso, Florida Power & Light Company, a division of NextEra, announced Cummins will supply a 25-megawatt electrolyzer system for the groundbreaking FPL Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub. The Hydrogen Hub will be Florida's first of its kind green hydrogen plant and will use solar energy to power the electrolysis process. Once built, this will be the largest PEM electrolyzer installation in North America. These acquisitions, product development announcements and project wins are all part of our Destination Zero strategy to evolve our company, our products and our customers' products to the technologies needed for a decarbonized world.\nThe strategy, which we reviewed with you at Analyst Day, includes reducing carbon emissions now by making improvements in the technologies we know today, while rapidly advancing the zero emissions technologies of the future.\nAnother important development during the first quarter was the company's decision to indefinitely suspend our operations in Russia as the conflict in Ukraine persists with no peaceful resolution sight. We are continuing to evaluate the best way to support our employees during this difficult time in accordance with local laws and regulations. We are also actively working with community organizations, especially in Romania and Poland to determine how we can assist refugees as they arrive.\nNow I will comment on the overall performance for the first quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets.\nDemand for our products remain strong across all of our key markets and regions, with a notable exception of China, resulting in record revenues for the first quarter of 2022. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. EBITDA was $755 million or 11.8% compared to $980 million or 16.1% a year ago. First quarter results include costs of $158 million related to the suspension of operations in Russia and $17 million related to preparations for the separation of the Filtration business, which we have discussed in previous calls.\nThe costs incurred relating to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, include inventory write-downs, reserves on accounts receivable, the impairment of a joint venture investment and other costs. My comments moving forward will exclude the onetime financial impact of the suspension of our Russian operations.\nEBITDA percentage declined in the first quarter as joint venture income dropped from a record high in the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by the slowdown in China markets. Research and development expenses also increased in the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantage in the future, particularly in the Engine and New Power segments.\nGross margin percentage improved compared to the first quarter of last year. As the benefit of pricing, we implemented at the beginning of this year exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and material cost increases during the quarter. This pricing only partially offset the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we carried through from 2021.\nOur first quarter revenues in North America grew 12% to $3.7 billion, driven by improved pricing and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 65,000 units, up 8% from 2021 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 23,000, flat with 2021.\nIndustry production of medium-duty trucks was 29,000 units in the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 9% from 2021 levels, while our unit sales were 26,000, down 3% from 2021. We shipped 42,000 engines to Stellantis for their use in Ram pickups in the first quarter of 2022, flat with last year. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 60%, as nonresidential construction spending rose and rental companies increased capital spending.\nRevenues for North America power generation declined by 3% as supply chain constraints limited our production for both U.S. military and mobile power applications.\nOur international revenues decreased by 3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 31% due to lower sales in on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 264,000 units, a decrease of 55% from last year. Last year's numbers were unusually strong, supported by a pre-buy ahead of NS VI. But weaker new vehicle demand and economic impacts from shutdowns as the country responded to a COVID-19 resurgence have pushed the market below normal levels.\nOur sales and units, including joint ventures, were 35,000, a decrease of 62%. The light-duty market in China decreased 20% from 2021 levels to 468,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 34,000 units, a decrease of 24%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 77,000 units, a decrease of 39% from record 2021 levels. The decrease was driven by decline in demand within the property market and the COVID-19 impact on infrastructure. Our units sold were 13,000, a decrease of 41%.\nSales of power generation equipment increased 58% in the first quarter, primarily driven by data center customers. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $621 million an increased 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck demand increased by 18%, while our shipments increased by 16%. Demand for power generation and construction equipment also increased in the first quarter as economic activity continued to improve.\nIn Brazil, our revenues increased 10%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.\nNow let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenues from -- for 2022 to be up 8% compared to our prior guidance of up 6%. This guidance reflects a stronger outlook in North America and a weaker outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with last year.\nWe are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 250,000 to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase year-over-year. The supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing continue to limit supply relative to strong end-user demand.\nIn the North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. Consistent with our guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be down 5% compared to 2021.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 10% in 2022. We now project a 40% reduction in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and 12% reduction in demand in the light-duty truck market compared to a 30% decline and a 5% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance.\nIndustry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the projected decline in China and current economic uncertainty, we remain well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in this region. Industry volumes of NS VI products will increase this year as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our experience in meeting similar standards in the United States and Europe has prepared us to meet these standards, allowing us to offer strong support to our partners through the transition. We continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions and build momentum in the new power space through partnerships and in-country capabilities to establish a leadership position in that developing market.\nIn India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 10% in 2022, in line with our previous guidance. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% this year.\nWe continue to project most major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat this year compared to the prior year, a decrease in our prior guidance of up 10%. Demand driven by continued strength in commodity prices is now being offset with a volume decline from our suspension of operations in Russia. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 95% in 2022, albeit off a low base. Our previous guidance for oil and gas engines was an increase of 25%.\nFortunately, we were able to reallocate a significant number of our build slots from planned mining sales into Russia to meet increased demand in the U.S. oil and gas market. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction, consistent with our prior guidance. We are now projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% from 2021, up from our previous estimate of up 10%. This is driven by parts demand within our North American on-highway business as well as global power systems market.\nIn New Power, we continue to expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. In the first quarter, new order intake for electrolyzers was the strongest we have seen to date, contributing to an already healthy backlog. We will continue to accelerate our collaboration with OEMs on both electrified power and fuel cell power for applications in 2022.\nAs a recent example, we are partnering with Scania, a world leader of trucks and buses for heavy transport applications to deliver 20 fuel cell electric trucks by next -- end of next year, demonstrating hydrogen's viability as an alternative power due to its energy density and flexible use.\nIn summary, we are increasing our revenue outlook for the year with year-over-year growth expected in most major regions, except China. We are maintaining our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance of approximately 15.5%, excluding the impacts of our indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our Filtration business. We expect to deliver this strong profitability despite the supply chain constraints and rising inflationary costs that we are experiencing.\nDuring the quarter, we've returned $518 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. Strong execution resulted in record sales in the first quarter despite the very difficult operating environment. The ongoing supply chain constraints through the industry, the continued COVID-19-related impacts and the effect of the conflict in Ukraine all present challenges to operating our business normally.\nI'm humbled by the commitment and resilience of our employees and leaders around the world who are navigating through these difficulties, delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Cummins has never been in a stronger position, allowing us to invest in the products and technologies that will fund future growth, drive advantage for our customers and help decarbonize our industry. And we will accomplish this while generating strong financial results and return cash to shareholders.\nNow let me turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Smith\n\nCFO & VP, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Four key takeaways from my comments today. Number one, that global demand remains strong, and we delivered record revenue in the first quarter. Second, we also delivered solid profitability in the quarter as gross margins improved compared to a tough Q4 last year.\nTom said, we returned $518 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and we've raised our full year outlook despite the many challenges around the globe. We have suspended our commercial operations in Russia indefinitely, which resulted in a pretax charge of $158 million in the first quarter of 2022. To provide clarity on operational performance, I'm excluding the impact of this charge in my comments. We have provided a breakdown of the costs associated with Russia in our earnings material, broken out by operating segment and P&L line item [video] analysis.\nNow let me go into more details on the first quarter performance. First quarter revenues were $6.4 billion, up 5% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 12% and international revenues dropped 3% due to a sharp slowdown in China. Unfavorable foreign currency movements impacted international sales by 2%.\nEBITDA was $913 million or 14.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $980 million or 16.1% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven by negative other income, lower joint venture earnings, primarily in China, and higher operating expenses, principally engineering expense to support future product development.\nGross margins improved year-over-year and also from the fourth quarter, both of which were relatively tough quarters from a gross margin perspective.\nNow let me discuss each line item in more detail. Gross margin of $1.6 billion or 24.9% of sales increased by $105 million or 50 basis points compared to a weak Q1 last year. The benefits of stronger volumes, including aftermarket and higher pricing, more than offset a higher freight costs and material costs from a year ago.\nSelling, admin and research expenses increased $79 million or 9%, primarily due to higher research costs, which support future growth as well as $17 million of expenses associated with the planned separation of our Filtration business.\nJoint venture income declined by $39 million versus a year ago, driven by lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was a negative $52 million, $45 million worse than a year ago.\nDuring our Analyst Day in February, we highlighted our new advanced range of fuel-agnostic combustion engines, which are receiving very strong customer interest. As we finalized our product plans for the new platforms, we wrote down the value of certain existing assets, which negatively impacted other income by $36 million. In addition, we experienced $37 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans in the first quarter. This compares to a $32 million mark-to-market loss a year ago.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $565 million or $3.95 per diluted share compared to $603 million or $4.07 from a year ago. The costs associated with Russia and the planned separation of the filtration business reduced Q1 EPS by $1.12. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%, which included unfavorable discrete tax items of $31 million.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $164 million versus $339 million in Q1 of 2021. The lower cash flow result was a result of lower earnings and a higher payout of variable compensation this year compared to the payout in 2021.\nI'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues increased 12% from a year ago, while EBITDA increased from 14.4% of sales to 15.4% as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing actions more than offset lower joint venture income and increased input costs.\nIn 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8%, up 1% from our prior guidance, primarily driven by higher aftermarket sales in North America.\n2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 14.5%, down 100 basis points from our prior guidance, primarily due to lower joint venture income in China as well as acknowledging the impairment costs in Q1. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to $2.1 billion, a record for the segment.\nEBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 9.9% compared to 8.7% a year ago, primarily due to higher aftermarket volumes and pricing. We expect 2022 distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to 2021, in line with our prior guidance. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by stronger aftermarket demand globally.\nEBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of approximately 10.5%, up from our prior forecast of 10% primarily driven by strong aftermarket. Components segment revenue decreased 8% in the first quarter, primarily driven by a weaker demand in China. EBITDA decreased from 19.6% of sales to 16.4%, driven by the negative impacts of lower volume as well as higher material and logistics expenses.\nWe expect revenues to increase 6%, but from our prior forecast of 4%, primarily due to higher aftermarket sales, which more than offset weaker demand in China. EBITDA margin is projected to be 16.75%, up from last year and our prior guidance primarily due to stronger volumes and some efficiency gains.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 14% in the first quarter and EBITDA decreased from 12.3% to 9.5% of sales as the benefits of stronger volumes were more than offset by higher supply chain expenses. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8%, 3% higher than our prior forecast, primarily due to higher demand for oil and gas and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA is projected to be 11% for the full year, in line with our prior year guidance.\nIn the New Power segment, revenues were $31 million, down from $35 million a year ago due to the timing of electrolyzer sales. Our EBITDA loss was $67 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. For the new power business, we still anticipate full year 2022 revenues to be approximately $200 million, representing an increase of 72%.\nNet expense in that segment is still projected to be approximately $290 million as we continue to make targeted investments. We are raising our full year 2022 expectations for company revenues to be up 8% from our previous guidance of 6%, primarily driven by strong demand in North America while maintaining our guidance for company EBITDA margins at approximately 15.5%. This guidance excludes the first quarter charge for Russia and any expenses associated with the separation of the Filtration business.\nWe continue to see challenges with global supply chain performance and rising input costs and have raised prices to counter the inflation. We will continue to monitor costs closely and evaluate the need for further price increases. We expect earnings from joint ventures now to decline 20% this year, excluding the impact of our suspension of Russia operations. This is down from our prior guidance of down 15% to 20% due to a weaker outlook in China.\nWe are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% in 2022, excluding any discrete items. Our outlook for capital investments is also unchanged at $850 million to $900 million for the year. We anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nTo summarize, demand remains strong in nearly all of our end markets with China, the notable exception. We delivered record sales and solid profitability in the first quarter and have raised our outlook for the full year. We remain focused on strengthening our position in our core markets, investing in technologies that will accelerate our plans for future profitable growth and generating strong returns. Thank you for your interest today. And now let me turn it back to Chris.\n\nChristopher Clulow\n\nThank you, Mark, and we're ready for our Q&A session now.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jack Kienzler, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJack Kienzler\n\nExecutive Director of IR, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jennifer Rumsey; our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith; and our Corporate Controller, Chris Clulow. Mark is dealing with a bit of a cough today, so Chris is going to read his remarks this morning.\nWe will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation, are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.\nWith that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.\n\nN. Thomas Linebarger\n\nChairman & CEO, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Jack, and good morning, everybody. Before I jump into our results, though, I do want to welcome Chris Clulow to our Investor Relations function. So yes, he is our Corporate Controller, but he is replacing Jack as the Head of the Investor Relations function soon. And so Chris has been with the company for 18 years. He's gained valuable leadership experience and roles across the finance organization. During his career journey, Chris has served as the controller of the Engine and Components businesses while also playing a key role in development and strategy. Chris has served as the Corporate Controller for the last 5 years and has a deep understanding of our business and our financial performance. He'll be a terrific addition to the Investor Relations team and will continue Jack's efforts to improve communications with investors, to make sure that you have the insights and understanding you need of our business and our financial condition and to work with our managers across the company to ensure that they understand what investors expect of us. I'm grateful to Jack for his contributions to Investor Relations and excited for him about his new opportunity serving as the finance leader for our Filtration business. Thank you, Jack, and welcome, Chris.\nNow I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and our market trends by region, and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Chris will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance as well as our forecast for this year.\nStrong economic recovery, combined with high demand for our products, resulted in record full-year revenues in 2021. On the other hand, our industry continues to experience significant supply chain constraints, driving elevated manufacturing, logistics and material costs and resulting in margins below our expectations, particularly in the fourth quarter. We've taken a number of actions to significantly improve our margins in 2022 and expect to generate strong incrementals through increased pricing as well as surcharges, combined with cost reduction initiatives in our supply chain and operations. Having effectively managed through a challenging 2021, we expect improved performance in 2022 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders.\nThe decarbonization of our economy is critical to our way of life and our industry and -- excuse me, and all of us and it will -- and our industry will play a key role in the effort to decarbonize our economy. Fortunately, decarbonization is also a growth opportunity for Cummins. We are confident in our ability to play a leading role in bringing lower carbon technologies to the commercial and industrial markets globally and to generate strong returns due to the unique capabilities that Cummins has built over many years. Specifically, we're a leader in key technologies for 0 tail pipe emissions in commercial and industrial applications and are investing further to strengthen our position.\nWe're also a leader in the transition technologies that will be needed in our industry for many, many years. Technologies at lower carbon emissions, while still offering customers economic solutions and hard-to-abate applications. We also have existing relationships with leading OEMs and customers around the globe and are continually forming new partnerships with market leaders in a variety of industries. These relationships bring us visibility to opportunities and product plans. They drive economies of scale and production and service, and they provide the trust of those making key purchase decisions.\nWe have a deep knowledge of our end markets and applications, each of which has unique technical and performance service and service demands. We know how to adapt existing and new technologies into our product -- into products, excuse me, that customers can actually use and operate economically. We are building a combination of businesses that have both the capability to serve the industry and the agility necessary to quickly pivot our product offerings depending on changes in regulations or infrastructure, advancements in technology and end-user preference. We have invested significantly to attract and build the best talent and to create an environment for innovation and long-term success that will increase shareholder value.\nAs a result of the successful execution of our strategy over many years, we are also in a very strong financial position, which allows us to make the sustained investments required to transition our industry to a 0 carbon future, while navigating economic cycles and returning excess cash to shareholders. We're excited to tell you more about our long-term strategy during our Analyst Day later this month.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $5.9 billion, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as increased demand in many of our international markets was offset by a decline in North American sales as our customers work to clear their production backlog. EBITDA was $705 million or 12.1% compared to $837 million or 14.4% a year ago. EBITDA decreased as a percentage of sales due to the elevated material and supply chain costs we continue to experience. These impacts were partially offset by lower product coverage costs.\nFor the full year, Cummins sales were $24 billion, up 21% year-over-year and a record for our company. Our EBITDA margins were $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales compared to $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales in 2020. Higher supply chain and material expenses, as well as higher compensation expenses, more than offset the benefits of higher volume, higher joint venture income and lower product coverage expense compared to 2020.\nNow I'll cover the full year trends across our key markets, beginning with North America before moving to our international regions. Our revenues in North America increased 17% in 2021, primarily due to higher demand across on-highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks increased 228,000 units, up 26% from 2020 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 85,000, an increase of 37% from 2020. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 115,000 units in 2021, an increase of 12% from 2020 levels, while our unit sales were 94,000, an increase of 21% from 2020. We shipped 159,000 engines to Chrysler for use in their Ram pickups in 2021, an increase of 27% from the previous year.\nEngine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 50% as nonresidential construction spending increased and rental companies increased capital spending. Engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America increased by 13% from last year, with higher demand from agriculture, rail and mining segments, partially offset by decreased shipments to defense and marine customers. Power generation revenues increased 6% year-over-year, driven by higher demand for standby applications, again resulting from higher nonresidential construction spending.\nOur international revenues increased 27% in 2021 with higher demand in all markets. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $7.5 billion, up 8% compared to 2020. The increased revenue was driven by record demand in the truck, construction and data center markets, particularly in the first half of the year. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 1.6 million units, a decrease of 11%, driven by a decline in production in the second half of the year following a significant prebuy period, ahead of broad NS VI implementation in July. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 249,000 units, a decline of 13%. The light-duty market in China decreased 4% from 2020 levels to 2.1 million units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 150,000 units, a decrease of 21% as new regulations drove demand for smaller displacement engines.\nIndustry demand for excavators set another record of 342,000 units in 2021, an increase of 4% from 2020 levels. Our units sold were 56,000 units, an increase of 5%.\nIn our Power Systems markets, power generation sales in China increased 48% compared to 2020, driven by growth in key markets such as infrastructure, health care and mobile power applications, driven by the power shortage in the country. Industrial engine sales increased 18% from 2020, primarily driven by strong mining demand. Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $2 billion, up 68%. Industry truck production increased by 76% in 2021. Demand for construction equipment increased by 55%, and power generation revenues increased 38% as the broader economy in India recovered off a very low base in 2020. In Brazil, our revenues increased 46%, driven by higher demand in most end markets.\nNow let me provide our overall outlook for 2022 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2022 to increase 6% compared to 2021, driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India, offset by China, where we expect demand to moderate after a strong year in 2021. We expect demand for construction equipment to increase in North America and Europe and decline in China from record levels experienced in 2021. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase by 10% compared to 2021. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 250,000 to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase year-over-year. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 120,000 units or between 120,000 and 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market as the engine partnerships we announced last year continue to phase in. Our shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be down 5% compared to last year.\nIn China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 10% in 2021. We project a 30% reduction in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and a 5% reduction in demand in the light-duty truck market. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from last year's record levels. Despite the projected decline in China, we remain well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. Industry volumes of NS VI product will increase in 2022 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. We first launched engines to meet standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago, and we have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies along with China local customer and market requirements to develop a range of products for the Chinese markets that we expect to be highly competitive and well accepted by end users. We continue to ramp production, expand our presence in automated manual transmissions and have launched new natural gas platform, which will play an increasingly important role as the region moves towards a lower emissions future.\nFinally, we continue to build momentum in the new power space, adding partnerships and in-country capabilities to establish a leadership position as the market develops. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 10% in 2021. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% this year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to increase by 10% in 2022 with greater demand following continued strength in commodity prices. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 25% this year, albeit off a very low base, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction spending.\nIn New Power, we expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to deliver fuel cell systems for use in the European rail market and other adjacent markets as adoption gains momentum. We also expect to continue to provide fuel cells for truck applications this year as more end users try out the new technology.\nWe are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel and natural gas to hydrogen and other low carbon fuels to fuel cells and battery electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be the leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment.\nWe expect supply chain constraints to continue to impact our industry during the first half of 2022, driving inflation and elevated costs. We will continue to place a strong focus on managing costs and cash flow and are well positioned to generate attractive incremental margins as constraints ease across our markets.\nIn summary, we expect full year sales growth of 6% and EBITDA to be approximately 15.5% of sales. We are projecting EBITDA as a percent of sales to increase versus 2021, primarily due to strong truck production in North America, increased pricing and surcharges and the easing of supply chain costs. We anticipate profitability will be at the low end of our guidance range in the first half of 2022 as the industry continues to manage through supply constraints that are limiting production and adding incremental costs. We anticipate these costs will ease throughout the year, driving stronger performance in the second half of the year.\nNow let me turn it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nChristopher C. Clulow\n\nVP & Corporate Controller, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. There are 4 key takeaways from my comments today. Global supply constraints continue to limit growth for our industry in the fourth quarter, resulted in elevated freight and logistic costs and drove inefficiencies in our operations, negatively impacting margins. We've been experiencing supply side challenges all year and saw further escalation in global freight rates in the fourth quarter. .\nOn a more positive note, underlying demand in many of our core markets remain strong, pointing to another record revenue year in 2022.\nFourth quarter margins were below our expectations, and we have taken actions to improve in 2022, including pricing, surcharges and a strong focus on cost reduction, which are reflected in guidance for this year.\nAnd lastly, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nNow let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.9 billion, flat with a year ago. Sales in North America were down 4%, inhibited by supply constraints, and international revenues increased 6%. Currency movements in aggregate did not have a significant impact on revenue.\nEarnings before interest and tax, depreciation and amortization were $705 million or 12.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $837 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. EBITDA decreased by $132 million versus the fourth quarter last year as higher freight, labor and material costs more than offset lower product coverage cost and the benefits of pricing actions.\nGross margin of $1.3 billion or 22.5% of sales decreased by $44 million or 80 basis points. Lower product coverage expense and the benefits of higher pricing were more than offset by higher material and logistics cost.\nSelling, administrative and research expenses increased by $86 million or 10% due to higher compensation costs, including higher variable compensation related to stronger full year 2021 earnings and program costs associated with future growth. Joint venture income declined by $1 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China versus a year ago, partially offset by strength in China power generation markets.\nOther income of $31 million increased by $7 million from a year ago.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $394 million or $2.73 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 from a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.2%.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $732 million, $410 million lower than the fourth quarter last year. Lower earnings and higher working capital contributed to the decline in cash generation.\nFor the full year 2021, revenues were a record $24 billion, an increase of 21% or $4.2 billion from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 17% and international revenues increased 27%. Currency movements positively impacted revenues by 2%.\nEarnings before interest and tax, depreciation and amortization were $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales for 2021 compared to $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales a year ago. EBITDA declined as a percent of sales primarily due to elevated supply chain and material costs and higher compensation expenses, which more than offset the benefits of higher volumes, higher joint venture income and lower product coverage expense.\nNet earnings were $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted shares. This compared to $1.8 billion or $12.01 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2.3 billion, down from $2.7 billion a year ago. Higher working capital was the primary driver of the lower cash generation.\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $734 million, up $206 million from 2020 when we reprioritized and reduced our plans in the face of extreme uncertainty. We returned to $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 98% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2021. In the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion in shares of common stock upon completion of the company's 2019 $2 billion share repurchase program, reinforcing the company's commitment to deliver strong returns to shareholders and confidence in long-term performance.\nMoving on to the operating segments, I will summarize their 2021 results and provide our forecast for 2022.\nFor the Engine segment, 2021 revenues increased 24% from a year ago, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization decreased from 15.4% to 14.2% of sales as the impacts of supply side costs more than offset the benefits of higher volumes. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 7%. The increase in sales is primarily driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America and higher aftermarket revenues in North America. 2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 15.5% compared to 14.2% of sales in 2021. The benefit of higher volumes, increased pricing and lower logistics costs are expected to more than offset lower joint venture income.\nIn the Distribution segment, revenues increased 9% from a year ago to $7.8 billion. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased as a percent of sales to 9.4% compared to 9.3% of sales a year ago. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to 2021. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by stronger aftermarket demand. EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 10% compared to 9.4% of sales in 2021, primarily due to higher volumes and increased pricing.\nComponents segment revenues increased 27% in 2021, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization decreased from 16% of sales to 15.4% as higher material, logistics and compensation expenses more than offset the benefits of stronger volumes. This year, we expect revenues to increase 4%, primarily due to higher industry truck production in North America, offsetting weaker demand in China. EBITDA margin is projected to be approximately 16% compared to 15.4% of sales in 2021, primarily due to stronger volumes, increased pricing and some efficiency gains.\nIn the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 22% in 2021, and EBITDA increased from 9.4% to 11.2% of sales as the benefits of stronger volumes and better mix more than offset higher compensation expenses and elevated freight costs. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 5%, primarily due to higher demand for mining engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11% compared to 11.2% of sales in 2021.\nIn the New Power segment, revenues increased 61% to $116 million in 2021, primarily driven by stronger sales of battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $223 million in 2021 as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2022, we anticipate revenues to be approximately $200 million, up 72%. Net expense is projected to be approximately $290 million as we continue to make targeted investments in this space. As Tom mentioned, we are projecting 2022 company revenues to be up 6%. Company EBITDA margins are projected to be approximately 15.5%. EBITDA is projected to increase as a percent of sales versus 2021, primarily due to stronger truck production volumes in North America, increased pricing and easing of supply chain challenges. We anticipate profitability will be lower in the first half of 2022 than the second half with some of the challenges we saw in 2021 continuing into the first quarter of 2022.\nWe expect earnings from joint ventures to decline 15% to 20% in 2022, primarily due to a decline in demand in China truck and construction markets and the transition of our natural gas engine joint venture in North America to fully consolidated in 2022. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% in 2022, excluding any discrete items. We expect that our 2022 capital investments will be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.\nAs we have discussed in prior years, our base case is to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time. We accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% base case, given the excess cash generated above our core business needs. We will continue to evaluate the best ways to deploy capital for profitable growth and deliver strong returns to shareholders.\nTo summarize, demand recovered in nearly all our markets in 2021, and we delivered record sales and higher full year earnings despite facing significant supply constraints. Fourth quarter margins were below our expectations, and we have some actions, including price increases that should see improvements starting in the first quarter of 2022. As we enter 2022, end customer demand remains in many of our core markets, and we are well positioned to deliver a strong year. Our focus remains on investing in the products and technologies that position us to grow profitably for the long run, improve performance cycle over cycle and return excess capital to shareholders.\nThank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Jack.\n\nJack Kienzler\n\nExecutive Director of IR, Cummins Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we are now ready for our first question.",

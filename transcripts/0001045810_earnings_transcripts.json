With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you, Toshiya. We delivered another outstanding quarter with revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year, and a record sequential revenue growth of $10 billion, or 22%. Our customers continue to lean into three platform shifts, fueling exponential growth for accelerated computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. Yet we are still in the early innings of these transitions that will impact our work across every industry. We currently have visibility to half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026. By executing our annual product cadence and extending our performance leadership through full-stack design, we believe NVIDIA will be the superior choice for the $3 to 4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure build we estimate by the end of the decade. Demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations.\nThe clouds are sold out, and our GPU-installed base, both new and previous generations, including Blackwell, Hopper, and Ampere, is fully utilized. Record Q3 data center revenue of $51 billion increased 66% year-over-year, a significant feat at our scale. Compute grew 56% year-over-year, driven primarily by the GB300 ramp, while networking more than doubled given the onset of NVLink scale-up, and robust double-digit growth across Spectrum-X Ethernet and Quantum-X InfiniBand. The world hyperscalers, a trillion-dollar industry, are transforming search, recommendations, and content understanding from classical machine learning to generative AI. NVIDIA CUDA excels at both, and is the ideal platform for this transition, driving infrastructure investment measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. At Meta, AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content, leading to more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads.\nAnalyst expectations for the top CSPs and hyperscalers in 2026 aggregate CapEx have continued to increase and now sit roughly at $600 billion, more than $200 billion higher relative to the start of the year. We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity. Another growth pillar is the ongoing increase in compute spend driven by foundation model builders such as Anthropic, Mistral, OpenAI, Reflection, Safe Superintelligence, Thinking Machines Lab, and xAI, all scaling compute aggressively to scale intelligence. The three scaling laws, pre-training, post-training, and inference, remain intact. In fact, we see a positive virtuous cycle emerging whereby the three scaling laws and access to compute are generating better intelligence and, in turn, increasing adoption and profits.\nOpenAI recently shared that their weekly user base has grown to 800 million, enterprise customers have increased to 1 million, and that their gross margins were healthy. Well, Anthropic recently reported that its annualized run rate revenue has reached $7 billion as of last month, up from $1 billion at the start of the year. We are also witnessing a proliferation of agentic AI across various industries and tasks. Companies such as Cursor, Anthropic, OpenEvidence, EPIC, and Abridge are experiencing a surge in user growth as they supercharge the existing workforce, delivering unquestionable ROI for coders and healthcare professionals. The world's most important enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, and SAP are integrating NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI stack. Our new partner, Palantir, is supercharging the incredibly popular ontology platform with NVIDIA CUDA X libraries and AI models for the first time.\nPreviously, like most enterprise software platforms, ontology runs only on CPUs. Lowe's is leveraging the platform to build supply chain agility, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction. Enterprises broadly are leveraging AI to boost productivity, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. RBC is leveraging agentic AI to drive significant analyst productivity, slashing report generation time from hours to minutes. AI and digital twins are helping Unilever accelerate content creation by 2x and cut costs by 50%. Salesforce's engineering team has seen at least a 30% productivity increase in new code development after adopting Cursor. This past quarter, we announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs. This demand spans every market: CSPs, sovereigns, model builders, enterprises, and supercomputing centers, and includes multiple landmark buildouts.\nxAI's Colossus 2, the world's first gigawatt-scale data center, Lilly's AI factory for drug discovery, the pharmaceutical industry's most powerful data center. Just today, AWS and Humane expanded their partnership, including the deployment of up to 150,000 AI accelerators, including our GB300. xAI and Humane also announced a partnership in which the two will jointly develop a network of world-class GPU data centers anchored by the flagship 500-megawatt facility. Blackwell gained further momentum in Q3. The GB300 crossed over GB200 and contributed roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. The transition to GB300 has been seamless, with production shipments to the majority of the major cloud service providers, hyperscalers, and GPU clouds, and is already driving their growth. The Hopper platform, in its 13th quarter since accession, recorded approximately $2 billion in revenue in Q3. H20 sales were approximately $50 million.\nSizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China. While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world. To establish a sustainable leadership position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer, and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China. The Rubin platform is on track to ramp in the second half of 2026. Powered by seven chips, the Vera Rubin platform will once again deliver an X-factor improvement in performance relative to Blackwell.\nWe have received silicon back from our supply chain partners and are happy to report that NVIDIA teams across the world are executing the bring-up beautifully. Rubin is our third-generation rack-scale system, substantially redefined the manufacturability while remaining compatible with Grace Blackwell. Our supply chain, data center ecosystem, and cloud partners have now mastered the build-to-installation process of NVIDIA's rack architecture. Our ecosystem will be ready for a fast Rubin ramp. Our annual X-factor performance leap increases performance per dollar, while driving down computing costs for our customers. The long useful life of NVIDIA's CUDA GPUs is a significant TCO advantage over accelerators. CUDA's compatibility and our massive installed base extend the life of NVIDIA systems well beyond their original estimated useful life. For more than two decades, we have optimized the CUDA ecosystem, improving existing workloads, accelerating new ones, and increasing throughput with every software release.\nMost accelerators without CUDA and NVIDIA's time-tested and versatile architecture became obsolete within a few years as model technologies evolve. Thanks to CUDA, the A100 GPUs we shipped six years ago are still running at full utilization today, powered by a vastly improved software stack. We have evolved over the past 25 years from a gaming GPU company to now an AI data center infrastructure company. Our ability to innovate across the CPU, the GPU, networking, and software, and ultimately drive down cost per token, is unmatched across the industry. Our networking business, purpose-built for AI and now the largest in the world, generated revenue of $8.2 billion, up 162% year-over-year, with NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X Ethernet all contributing to growth. We are winning in data center networking as the majority of AI deployments now include our switches, with Ethernet GPU attach rates roughly on par with InfiniBand.\nMeta, Microsoft, Oracle, and xAI are building gigawatt AI factories with Spectrum-X Ethernet switches, and each will run its operating system of choice, highlighting the flexibility and openness of our platform. We recently introduced Spectrum-XGS, a scale-across technology that enables gigascale AI factories. NVIDIA is the only company with AI scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across platforms, reinforcing our unique position in the market as the AI infrastructure provider. Customer interest in NVLink Fusion continues to grow. We announced a strategic collaboration with Fujitsu in October, where we will integrate Fujitsu's CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs via NVLink Fusion, connecting our large ecosystems. We also announced a collaboration with Intel to develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products, connecting NVIDIA and Intel's ecosystems using NVLink. This week at Supercomputing 25, ARM announced that it will be integrating NVLink IP for customers to build CPU SoCs that connect with NVIDIA.\nCurrently on its fifth generation, NVLink is the only proven scale-up technology available on the market today. In the latest MLPerf training results, Blackwell Ultra delivered 5x faster time to train than Hopper. NVIDIA swept every benchmark. Notably, NVIDIA is the only training platform to leverage FP4 while meeting MLPerf's strict accuracy standards. In semi-analysis inference max benchmark, Blackwell achieved the highest performance and lowest total cost of ownership across every model and use case. Particularly important is Blackwell's NVLink's performance on a mixture of experts, the architecture for the world's most popular reasoning models. On DeepSeek R1, Blackwell delivered 10x higher performance per watt and 10x lower cost per token versus H200, a huge generational leap fueled by our extreme co-design approach. NVIDIA Dynamo, an open-source, low-latency, modular inference framework, has now been adopted by every major cloud service provider.\nLeveraging Dynamo's enablement and disaggregated inference, the resulting increase in performance of complex AI models such as MoE models, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and OCI have boosted AI inference performance for enterprise cloud customers. We are working on a strategic partnership with OpenAI focused on helping them build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. In addition, we have the opportunity to invest in the company. We serve OpenAI through their cloud partners, Microsoft Azure, OCI, and CoreWeave. We will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As they continue to scale, we are delighted to support the company to add self-build infrastructure, and we are working toward a definitive agreement, and are excited to support OpenAI's growth. Yesterday, we celebrated an announcement with Anthropic.\nFor the first time, Anthropic is adopting NVIDIA, and we are establishing a deep technology partnership to support Anthropic's fast growth. We will collaborate to optimize Anthropic models for CUDA, and deliver the best possible performance, efficiency, and TCO. We will also optimize future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic workloads. Anthropic's compute commitment is initially including up to 1 gigawatt of compute capacity with Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Our strategic investments in Anthropic, Mistral, OpenAI, Reflection, Thinking Machines, and others represent partnerships that grow the NVIDIA CUDA AI ecosystem, and enable every model to run optimally on NVIDIA's everywhere. We will continue to invest strategically while preserving our disciplined approach to cash flow management. Physical AI is already a multi-billion dollar business addressing a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and the next leg of growth for NVIDIA.\nLeading US manufacturers and robotics innovators are leveraging NVIDIA's three-computer architecture to train on NVIDIA, test on Omniverse computer, and deploy real-world AI on Jetson robotic computers. PTC and Siemens introduced new services that bring Omniverse-powered digital twin workflows to their extensive installed base of customers. Companies including Belden, Caterpillar, Foxconn, Lucid Motors, Toyota, TSMC, and Wistron are building Omniverse digital twin factories to accelerate AI-driven manufacturing and automation. Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Figure, and Skild AI are building our platform, tapping offerings such as NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for development, Omniverse for simulation and validation, and Jetson to power next-generation intelligent robots. We remain focused on building resiliency and redundancy in our global supply chain. Last month, in partnership with TSMC, we celebrated the first Blackwell wafer produced on US soil.\nWe will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, Spill, and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years. Gaming revenue was $4.3 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by strong demand as Blackwell momentum continued. End-market sell-through remains robust, and channel inventories are at normal levels heading into the holiday season. Steam recently broke its concurrent user record with 42 million gamers, while thousands of fans packed the GeForce Gamer Festival in South Korea to celebrate 25 years of GeForce. NVIDIA Pro Visualization has evolved into computers for engineers and developers, whether for graphics or for AI. Professional visualization revenue was $760 million, up 56% year-over-year, was another record. Growth was driven by DGX Spark, the world's smallest AI supercomputer built on a small configuration of Grace Blackwell. Automotive revenue was $592 million, up 32% year-over-year, primarily driven by self-driving solutions.\nWe are partnering with Uber to scale the world's largest Level 4 ready autonomous fleet, built on the new NVIDIA Hyperion L4 Robotaxi reference architecture. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margins were 73.4%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 73.6%, exceeding our outlook. Gross margins increased sequentially due to our data center mix, improved cycle time, and cost structure. GAAP operating expenses were up 8% sequentially and up 11% on a non-GAAP basis. The growth was driven by infrastructure compute, as well as higher compensation and benefits in engineering development costs. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was just over 17%, higher than our guidance of 16.5% due to the strong US revenue. On our balance sheet, inventory grew 32% quarter over quarter, while supply commitments increased 63% sequentially.\nWe are preparing for significant growth ahead and feel good about our ability to execute against our opportunity set. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $65 billion, ±2%. At the midpoint, our outlook implies 14% sequential growth, driven by continued momentum in the Blackwell architecture. Consistent with last quarter, we are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75%, respectively, ±50 basis points. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2027, input costs are on the rise, but we are working to hold gross margins in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $6.7 billion and $5 billion, respectively.\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP taxes are expected to be 17%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. At this time, let me turn the call over to Jensen for him to say a few words.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Colette. There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, NVIDIA is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference. With our two-decade investment in CUDA-X acceleration libraries, we are also exceptional at science and engineering simulations, computer graphics, structured data processing, to classical machine learning.\nThe world is undergoing three massive platform shifts at once, the first time since the dawn of Moore's Law. NVIDIA is uniquely addressing each of the three transformations. The first transition is from CPU general-purpose computing to GPU accelerated computing, as Moore's Law slows. The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in compute cloud computing spend each year. Many of these applications, which ran once exclusively on CPUs, are now rapidly shifting to CUDA GPUs. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point. Secondly, AI has also reached a tipping point and is transforming existing applications, while enabling entirely new ones. For existing applications, generative AI is replacing classical machine learning in search ranking, recommender systems, ad targeting, click-through prediction, to content moderation, the very foundations of hyperscale infrastructure.\nMeta's Gem, a foundation model for ad recommendations trained on large-scale GPU clusters, exemplifies this shift. In Q2, Meta reported over a 5% increase in ad conversions on Instagram, and a 3% gain on Facebook feed, driven by generative AI-based Gem. Transitioning to generative AI represents substantial revenue gains for hyperscalers. Now, a new wave is rising: agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and using tools. From coding assistants like Cursor and Claude Code, to radiology tools like Aidoc, legal assistants like Harvey, and AI chauffeurs like Tesla FSD and Waymo, these systems mark the next frontier of computing. The fastest-growing companies in the world today—OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, Cursor, Lovable, Replit, Cognition AI, OpenEvidence, Abridge, Tesla—are pioneering agentic AI. There are three massive platform shifts. The transition to accelerated computing is foundational and necessary, essential in a post-Moore's Law era.\nThe transition to generative AI is transformational and necessary, supercharging existing applications and business models. The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary, giving rise to new applications, companies, products, and services. As you consider infrastructure investments, consider these three fundamental dynamics. Each will contribute to infrastructure growth in the coming years. NVIDIA has chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions, and thus so for any form and modality of AI across all industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots. One architecture. Toshiya, back to you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please pull for questions? Thank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Your first question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could update us. You talked about the $500 billion of revenue for Blackwell plus Rubin in 2025 and 2026 at GTC. At that time, you had talked about $150 billion of that already having been shipped. As the quarter's wrapped up, are those still kind of the general parameters that there's $350 billion in the next kind of 14 months or so? I would assume over that time, you haven't seen all the demand that there is. There's any possibility of upside to those numbers as we move forward?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks, Joe. I'll start first with a response here on that. Yes, that's correct. We are working into our $500 billion forecast, and we are on track for that as we have finished some of the quarters. We have several quarters now in front of us to take us through the end of calendar year 2026. The number will grow, and we will achieve, I'm sure, additional needs for compute that will be shippable by fiscal year 2026. We shipped $50 billion this quarter, but we would be not finished if we didn't say that we'll probably be taking more orders. For example, just even today, our announcements with KSA, and that agreement in itself is 400,000 to 600,000 more GPUs over three years. Anthropic is also net new. There's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. There's clearly a great deal of consternation around the magnitude of AI infrastructure buildouts, the ability to fund such plans, and the ROI. Yet at the same time, you're talking about being sold out. Every stood-up GPU is taken. The AI world hasn't seen the enormous benefit yet from B300, never mind Rubin. Gemini 3 just announced Grok 5 coming soon. The question is this: when you look at that as the backdrop, do you see a realistic path for supply to catch up with demand over the next 12 to 18 months, or do you think it can extend beyond that timeframe?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, as you know, we've done a really good job planning our supply chain. NVIDIA's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world. TSMC and their packaging, our memory vendors, memory partners, and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us. We were planning for a big year. We've seen for some time the three transitions that I spoke about just a second ago: accelerated computing from general-purpose computing. It's really important to recognize that AI is not just agentic AI, but generative AI is transforming the way that hyperscalers did the work that they used to do on CPUs.\nGenerative AI made it possible for them to move search and recommender systems and add recommendations and targeting. All of that has been moved to generative AI and is still transitioning. Whether you installed NVIDIA GPUs for data processing, or you did it for generative AI for your recommender system, or you're building it for agentic chatbots and the type of AIs that most people see when they think about AI, all of those applications are accelerated by NVIDIA. When you look at the totality of the spend, it's really important to think about each one of those layers. They're all growing, they're related, but not the same. The wonderful thing is that they all run on NVIDIA GPUs. Simultaneously, because the quality of the AI models are improving so incredibly, the adoption of it in the different use cases, whether it's in code assistance, which NVIDIA uses fairly exhaustively, and we're not the only one.\nI mean, the fastest-growing application in history, a combination of Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI's Codex, and GitHub Copilot, these applications are the fastest-growing in history. It's not just used for software engineers. It's used because of live coding. It's used by engineers and marketeers all over companies, supply chain planners all over companies. I think that that's just one example, and the list goes on, whether it's OpenEvidence and the work that they do in healthcare or the work that's being done in digital video editing, Runway. I mean, the number of really, really exciting startups that are taking advantage of generative AI and agentic AI is growing quite rapidly. Not to mention, we're all using it a lot more.\nAll of these exponentials, not to mention, just today, I was reading a text from Demis, and he was saying that pre-training and post-training are fully intact. Gemini 3 takes advantage of the scaling laws and received a huge jump in quality, performance, and model performance. We're seeing all of these exponentials kind of running at the same time. Just always go back to first principles and think about what's happening from each one of the dynamics that I mentioned before: general-purpose computing to accelerated computing, generative AI replacing classical machine learning, and, of course, agentic AI, which is a brand new category.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I'm curious, what assumptions are you making on NVIDIA content per gigawatt in that $500 billion number? We have heard numbers as low as $25 billion per gigawatt of content to as high as $30 or $40 billion per gigawatt. I'm curious what power and what dollar per gigawatt assumptions you are making as part of that $500 billion number. Longer-term, Jensen, the $3 to $4 trillion in data center by 2030 was mentioned. How much of that do you think will require vendor financing, and how much of that can be supported by cash flows of your large customers, governments, or enterprises?Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nIn each generation, from Ampere to Hopper, from Hopper to Blackwell, Blackwell to Rubin, our part of the data center increases. Hopper generation was probably something along the lines of 20-somewhat, 20 to 25. Blackwell generation, Grace Blackwell particularly, is probably 30 to 30, say 30 ±. Rubin is probably higher than that. In each one of these generations, the speedup is X factors, and therefore, their TCO, the customer TCO, improves by X factors. The most important thing is, in the end, you still only have one gigawatt of power, one gigawatt data centers, one gigawatt of power. Therefore, performance per watt, the efficiency of your architecture, is incredibly important. The efficiency of your architecture can't be brute forced. There is no brute forcing about it. That one gigawatt translates directly. Your performance per watt translates directly, absolutely directly, to your revenues, which is the reason why choosing the right architecture matters so much now.\nThe world doesn't have an excess of anything to squander. We have to be really, really—we use this concept called co-design across our entire stack, across the frameworks and models, across the entire data center, even power and cooling optimized across the entire supply chain and our ecosystem. Each generation, our economic contribution will be greater, our value delivered will be greater, but the most important thing is our energy efficiency per watt is going to be extraordinary every single generation. With respect to growing into continuing to grow, our customers' financing is up to them. We see the opportunity to grow for quite some time. Remember, today, most of the focus has been on the hyperscalers. One of the areas that is really misunderstood about the hyperscalers is that the investment on NVIDIA GPUs not only improves their scale, speed, and cost from general-purpose computing—that's number one—because Moore's Law scaling has really slowed.\nMoore's Law is about driving cost now. It's about deflationary cost, the incredible deflationary cost of computing over time. That has slowed. Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost now. Going to NVIDIA GPU computing is really the best way to do so. The second is revenue boosting in their current business models. Recommender systems drive the world's hyperscalers every single, whether it's watching short-form videos, recommending books, recommending the next item in your basket, recommending ads, or recommending news to—it's all about recommenders. The internet has trillions of pieces of content. How could they possibly figure out what to put in front of you and your little tiny screen unless they have really sophisticated recommender systems to do so? Well, that has gone generative AI.\nThe first two things that I just said, hundreds of billions of dollars of CapEx is going to have to be invested. It's fully cash flow funded. What is above it, therefore, is agentic AI. This is net new, net new consumption, but it's also net new applications. Some of the applications I mentioned before, but these new applications are also the fastest-growing applications in history. Okay? I think that you're going to see that once people start to appreciate what is actually happening under the water, if you will, from the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx investment, recognizing there's these three dynamics. Lastly, remember, we were just talking about the American CSPs. Each country will fund their own infrastructure. You have multiple countries, you have multiple industries.\nMost of the world's industries haven't really engaged agentic AI yet, and they're about to. All the names of companies that you know we're working with, whether it's autonomous vehicle companies, digital twins for physical AI for factories, and the number of factories and warehouses being built around the world, just the number of digital biology startups that are being funded so that we could accelerate drug discovery. All of those different industries are now getting engaged, and they're going to do their own fundraising. Don't just look at the hyperscalers as a way to build out for the future. You got to look at the world. You got to look at all the different industries. Enterprise computing is going to fund their own industry.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask you about cash. Speaking of half a trillion, you may generate about half a trillion in free cash flow over the next couple of years. What are your plans for that cash? How much goes to buyback versus investing in the ecosystem? How do you look at investing in the ecosystem? I think there's just a lot of confusion out there about how these deals work and your criteria for doing those, like the Anthropic, the OpenAIs, etc. Thanks a lot.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, appreciate the question. Of course, using cash to fund our growth, no company has grown at the scale that we're talking about and have the connection, the depth, and the breadth of supply chain that NVIDIA has.\nThe reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured a really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them. When we make purchases, our suppliers can take it to the bank. When we make forecasts, and we plan with them, they take us seriously because of our balance sheet. We're not making up the offtake. We know what our offtake is. Because they've been planning with us for so many years, our reputation and our credibility is incredible. It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth, the rate of growth, and the magnitude associated with that. That's number one. The second thing, of course, we're going to continue to do stock buybacks. We're going to continue to do that.\nWith respect to the investments, this is really, really important work that we do. All of the investments that we've done so far, well, all the period, is associated with expanding the reach of CUDA, expanding the ecosystem. If you look at the work, the investments that we did with OpenAI, it's, of course, that relationship we've had since 2016. I delivered the first AI supercomputer ever made to OpenAI. We've had a close and wonderful relationship with OpenAI since then. Everything that OpenAI does runs on NVIDIA today. All the clouds that they deploy in, whether it's training and inference, runs NVIDIA, and we love working with them. The partnership that we have with them is one so that we could work even deeper from a technical perspective, so that we could support their accelerated growth. This is a company that's growing incredibly fast.\nDon't just look at what is said in the press. Look at all the ecosystem partners and all the developers that are connected to OpenAI. They're all driving consumption of it. The quality of the AI that's being produced is a huge step up since a year ago, and the quality of response is extraordinary. We invest in OpenAI for a deep partnership in co-development to expand our ecosystem and to support their growth. Of course, rather than giving up a share of our company, we get a share of their company. We invested in them in one of the most consequential once-in-a-generation companies, once-in-a-generation company that we have a share of. I fully expect that investment to translate to extraordinary returns. In the case of Anthropic, this is the first time that Anthropic will be on NVIDIA's architecture.\nThe first time Anthropic will be on NVIDIA's architecture is the second most successful AI in the world in terms of total number of users. In enterprise, they're doing incredibly well. Claude Code is doing incredibly well. Claude is doing incredibly well all over the world's enterprise. Now we have the opportunity to have a deep partnership with them and bringing Claude onto the NVIDIA platform. What do we have now? NVIDIA's architecture, taking a step back, NVIDIA's architecture, NVIDIA's platform is the singular platform in the world that runs every AI model. We run OpenAI, we run Anthropic, we run xAI. Because of our deep partnership with Elon and xAI, we were able to bring that opportunity to Saudi Arabia, to the KSA, so that Humane could also be hosting opportunity for xAI. We run xAI, we run Gemini, we run Thinking Machines. Let's see.\nWhat else do we run? We run them all. Not to mention, we run the science models, the biology models, DNA models, gene models, chemical models, and all the different fields around the world. It's not just cognitive AI that the world uses. AI is impacting every single industry. We have the ability, through the ecosystem investments that we make, to partner with, deeply partner on a technical basis with some of the best companies, most brilliant companies in the world. We are expanding the reach of our ecosystem, and we're getting a share and investment in what will be a very successful company, oftentimes once-in-a-generation company. That's our investment thesis.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In the past, you've talked about roughly 40% of your shipments tied to AI inference. I'm wondering, as you look forward into next year, where do you expect that percentage could go in, say, a year's time? Can you maybe address the Rubin CPX product you expect to introduce next year and contextualize that? How big of the overall TAM you expect that can take, and maybe talk about some of the target customer applications for that specific product? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nCPX is designed for long-context type of workload generation. Long-context, basically, before you start generating answers, you have to read a lot, basically, long-context. It could be a bunch of PDFs, it could be watching a bunch of videos, studying 3D images, so on and so forth. You have to absorb the context. CPX is designed for long-context type of workloads. It's perf for dollars. Its perf for dollars is excellent. Its perf for what is excellent, which made me forget the first part of the question.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nInferencing.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nOh, inference. Yeah. There are three scaling laws that are scaling at the same time. The first scaling law called pretraining continues to be very effective. The second is post-training. Post-training basically has found incredible algorithms for improving an AI's ability to break a problem down and solve a problem step by step. Post-training is scaling exponentially. Basically, the more compute you apply to a model, the smarter it is, the more intelligent it is. The third is inference. Inference, because of chain of thought, because of reasoning capabilities, AIs are essentially reading, thinking before it answers. The amount of computation necessary as a result of those three things has gone completely exponential.\nI think that it's hard to know exactly what the percentage will be at any given point in time and who. Of course, our hope is that inference is a very large part of the market, because if inference is large, then what it suggests is that people are using it in more applications, and they're using it more frequently. We should all hope for inference to be very large. This is where Grace Blackwell is just an order of magnitude better, more advanced than anything in the world. The second best platform is H200. It's very clear now that GB300, GB200, and GB300, because of NVLink 72, the scale-up network that we have achieved, and you saw and Colette talked about in the semi-analysis benchmark, is the largest single inference benchmark ever done.\nGB200, NVLink 72, is 10x, 10 to 15x higher performance. That's a big step up. It's going to take a long time before somebody is able to take that on. Our leadership there is surely multi-year. Yeah. I think I'm hoping that inference becomes a very big deal. Our leadership in inference is extraordinary.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Jensen, many of your customers are pursuing behind-the-meter power. What's the single biggest bottleneck that worries you that could constrain your growth? Is it power, or maybe it's financing, or maybe it's something else like memory or even foundry? Thanks a lot.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, these are all issues, and they're all constraints. The reason for that, when you're growing at the rate that we are and the scale that we are, how could anything be easy? What NVIDIA is doing, obviously, has never been done before. We've created a whole new industry. On the one hand, we are transitioning computing from general-purpose and classical or traditional computing to accelerated computing and AI. That's on the one hand. On the other hand, we've created a whole new industry called AI factories. The idea that in order for software to run, you need these factories to generate it, generate every single token instead of retrieving information that was pre-created. I think this whole transition requires extraordinary scale.\nAll the way from the supply chain, of course, the supply chain, we have much better visibility and control over because, obviously, we're incredibly good at managing our supply chain. We have great partners that we've worked with for 33 years. The supply chain part of it, we're quite confident. Now, looking down our supply chain, we've now established partnerships with so many players in land, power, shell, and, of course, financing. None of these things are easy, but they're all tractable, and they're all solvable things. The most important thing that we have to do is do a good job planning. We plan up the supply chain, down the supply chain. We have established a whole lot of partners, so we have a lot of routes to market.\nVery importantly, our architecture has to deliver the best value to the customers that we have. At this point, I'm very confident that NVIDIA's architecture is the best performance per TCO. It is the best performance per watt, and therefore, for any amount of energy that is delivered, our architecture will drive the most revenues. I think the increasing rate of our success, I think that we're more successful this year at this point than we were last year at this point. The number of customers coming to us and the number of platforms coming to us after they've explored others is increasing, not decreasing. I think all of that is just all the things that I've been telling you over the years are really coming true and are becoming evident.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nQuestions. Colette, I have some questions on margins. You said for next year, you're working to hold them in the mid-70s. I guess, first of all, what are the biggest cost increases? Is it just memory, or is it something else? What are you doing to work toward that? How much is cost optimizations versus pre-buys versus pricing? Also, how should we think about OpEx growth next year, given the revenues seem likely to grow materially from where we're running right now?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Stacy. Let me see if I can start with remembering where we were with the current fiscal year that we're in. Remember, earlier this year, we indicated that through cost improvements and mix, we would exit the year and our gross margins in the mid-70s. We've achieved that and are getting ready to also execute that in Q4. Now it's time for us to communicate where we are working right now in terms of next year.\nNext year, there are input prices that are well-known in the industries that we need to work through. Our systems are by no means very easy to work with. There are a tremendous amount of components, many different parts of it, as we think about that. We're taking all of that into account. We do believe, as we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid-70s. That's our overall plan for gross margin. Your second question is around OpEx. Right now, our goal in terms of OpEx is to really make sure that we are innovating with our engineering teams, with all of our business teams, to create more and more systems for this market.\nAs you know, right now, we have a new architecture coming out, and that means they are quite busy in order to meet that goal. We're going to continue to see our investments on innovating more and more, both our software, our systems, and our hardware to do so. I'll leave it, turn it to Jensen if he wants to add any couple more comments.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. That's spot on. I think the only thing that I would add is remember that we plan, we forecast, we plan, and we negotiate with our supply chain well in advance. Our supply chain has known for quite a long time our requirements, and they've known for quite a long time our demand, and we've been working with them and negotiating with them for quite a long time. I think the recent surge, obviously, quite significant.\nRemember, our supply chain has been working with us for a very long time. In many cases, we've secured a lot of supply for ourselves because, obviously, they're working with the largest company in the world in doing so. We've also been working closely with them on the financial aspects of it, securing forecasts, plans, and so on and so forth. I think all of that has worked out well for us.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. Jensen, the question for you, as you think about the Anthropic deal that was announced and just the overall breadth of your customers, I'm curious if your thoughts around the role that AI ASICs or dedicated XPUs play in these architecture buildouts has changed at all. Have you seen? I think you've been fairly adamant in the past that some of these programs never really see deployments. I'm curious if we're at a point where maybe that's even changed more in favor of just GPU architecture. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the question. First of all, you're not competing against teams. Excuse me. Again, as a company, you're competing against teams. There just aren't that many teams in the world who are extraordinary at building these incredibly complicated things. Back in the Hopper day and the Ampere days, we would build one GPU. That's the definition of an accelerated AI system. Today, we've got to build entire racks, entire three different types of switches: a scale-up, a scale-out, and a scale-across switch.\nIt takes a lot more than one chip to build a compute node anymore. Everything about that computing system, because AI needs to have memory, AI didn't used to have memory at all. Now it has to remember things. The amount of memory and context it has is gigantic. The memory architecture implication is incredible. The diversity of models from mixture of experts to dense models, to diffusion models, to autoregressive, not to mention biological models that obey the laws of physics. The list of different types of models has exploded in the last several years. The challenge is the complexity of the problem is much higher. The diversity of AI models is incredibly large. This is where I will say the five things that make us special, if you will.\nThe first thing I would say that makes us special is that we accelerate every phase of that transition. That's the first phase. CUDA allows us to have CUDA X for transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing. We are incredibly good at generative AI. We're incredibly good at agentic AI. Every single phase of that, every single layer of that transition, we are excellent at. You can invest in one architecture, use it across the board. You can use one architecture and not worry about the changes in the workload across those three phases. That's number one. Number two, we're excellent at every phase of AI. Everybody's always known that we're incredibly good at pretraining. We're obviously very good at post-training, and we're incredibly good, as it turns out, at inference because inference is really, really hard. How could thinking be easy?\nPeople think that inference is one shot, and therefore, it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. It turns out to be the hardest of all because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard. We're great at every phase of AI, the second thing. The third thing is we're now the only architecture in the world that runs every AI model, every frontier AI model. We run open-source AI models incredibly well. We run science models, biology models, robotics models. We run every single model. We're the only architecture in the world that can claim that. It doesn't matter whether you're autoregressive or diffusion-based. We run everything. We run it for every major platform, as I just mentioned. We run every model. The fourth thing I would say is that we're in every cloud.\nThe reason why developers love us is because we're literally everywhere. We're in every cloud. We're in every—we could even make you a little tiny cloud called DGX Spark. We're in every computer. We're everywhere, from cloud to on-prem, to robotic systems, edge devices, PCs, you name it. One architecture, things just work. It's incredible. The last thing, and this is probably the most important thing, the fifth thing, is if you are a cloud service provider, if you're a new company like Humane, if you're a new company like CoreWeave, or NSCALE, or Nebius, or OCI for that matter, the reason why NVIDIA is the best platform for you is because our offtake is so diverse. We can help you with offtake. It's not about just putting a random ASIC into a data center. Where's the offtake coming from? Where's the diversity coming from?\nWhere's the resilience coming from? The versatility of the architecture coming from, the diversity of capability coming from. NVIDIA has such incredibly good offtake because our ecosystem is so large. These five things, every phase of acceleration and transition, every phase of AI, every model, every cloud to on-prem, and of course, finally, it all leads to offtake.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I will now turn the call to Toshiya Hari for closing remarks.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Strategic Finance, NVIDIA\n\nIn closing, please note we will be at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on 2 December 2024, and our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for 25 February 2025. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and close the call.\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you, Toshiya. We delivered another record quarter while navigating what continues to be a dynamic external environment. Total revenue was $46.7 billion, exceeded our outlook as we grew sequentially across all market platforms. Data center revenue grew 56% year-over-year. Data center revenue also grew sequentially despite the $4 billion decline in H20 revenue. NVIDIA's Blackwell platform reached record levels, growing sequentially by 17%. We began production shipments of GB300 in Q2. Our full-stack AI solutions for cloud service providers, Neoclouds, enterprises, and sovereigns are all contributing to our growth.\nWe are at the beginning of an industrial revolution that will transform every industry. We see $3 to 4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the end of the decade. The scale and scope of these buildouts present significant long-term growth opportunities for NVIDIA. The GB200 NVL system is seeing widespread adoption with deployments at CSPs and consumer internet companies. Lighthouse model builders, including OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral, are using the GB200 NVL72 at data center scale for both training next-generation models and serving inference models in production.\nThe new Blackwell Ultra platform has also had a strong quarter, generating tens of billions in revenue. The transition to the GB300 has been seamless for major cloud service providers due to its shared architecture, software, and physical footprint with the GB200, enabling them to build and deploy GB300 racks with ease. The transition to the new GB300 rack-based architecture has been seamless. Factory builds in late July and early August were successfully converted to support the GB300 ramp, and today, full production is underway. The current run rate is back at full speed, producing approximately 1,000 racks per week.\nThis output is expected to accelerate even further throughout the Q3 as additional capacity comes online. We expect widespread market availability in the second half of the year as CoreWeave prepares to bring their GB300 instance to market, as they are already seeing 10x more inference performance on reasoning models compared to H100. Compared to the previous Hopper generation, GB300 NVL72 AI factories promise a 10x improvement in token-per-watt energy efficiency, which translates to revenues as data centers are power limited.\nThe chips of the Rubin platform are in fab: the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, CX9 SuperNIC, NVLink 144 Scale-Up switch, Spectrum-X Scale-Out and Scale-Across switch, and the Silicon Photonics processor. Rubin remains on schedule for volume production next year. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack-scale AI supercomputer with a mature and full-scale supply chain. This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence, and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software. In late July, the US government began reviewing licenses for sales of H20 to China customers.\nWhile a select number of our China-based customers have received licenses over the past few weeks, we have not shipped any H20 based on those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. We have not included H20 in our Q3 outlook as we continue to work through geopolitical issues. If geopolitical issues reside, we should ship $2 to 5 billion in H20 revenue in Q3. If we add more orders, we can bill more.\nWe continue to advocate for the US government to approve Blackwell for China. Our products are designed and sold for beneficial commercial use, and every licensed sale we make will benefit the US economy, the US leadership. In highly competitive markets, we want to win the support of every developer. America's AI technology stack can be the world standard if we race and compete globally. Notably, in the quarter was an increase in Hopper 100 and H200 shipments. We also sold approximately $650 million of H20 in Q2 to an unrestricted customer outside of China.\nThe sequential increase in Hopper demand indicates the breadth of data center workloads that run on accelerated computing, and the power of CUDA libraries and full-stack optimizations, which continuously enhance the performance and economic value of our platform. As we continue to deliver both Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, we are focusing on meeting the soaring global demand. This growth is fueled by capital expenditures from the cloud to enterprises, which are on track to invest $600 billion in data center infrastructure and compute this calendar year alone, nearly doubling in two years.\nWe expect annual AI infrastructure investments to continue growing, driven by several factors: reasoning agentic AI requiring orders of magnitude more training and inference compute, global buildouts for Sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of physical AI and robotics. Blackwell has set the benchmark as it is the new standard for AI inference performance. The market for AI inference is expanding rapidly, with reasoning and agentic AI gaining traction across industries. Blackwell's rack-scale NVLink and CUDA full-stack architecture addresses this by redefining the economics of inference.\nNew NVFP4 4-bit precision and NVLink 72 on the GB300 platform delivers a 50x increase in energy efficiency per token compared to Hopper, enabling companies to monetize their compute at unprecedented scale. For instance, a $3 million investment in GB200 infrastructure can generate $30 million in token revenue, a 10x return. NVIDIA's software innovation, combined with the strength of our developer ecosystem, has already improved Blackwell's performance by more than 2x since its launch.\nAdvances in CUDA, TensorRT-LLM, and Dynamo are unlocking maximum efficiency. CUDA library contributions from the open-source community, along with NVIDIA's open libraries and frameworks, are now integrated into millions of workflows. This powerful flywheel of collaborative innovation between NVIDIA and global community contributions strengthens NVIDIA's performance leadership. NVIDIA is a top contributor to OpenAI models, data, and software. Blackwell has introduced a groundbreaking numerical approach to large language model pre-training.\nUsing NVFP4 computations on the GB300 can now achieve 7x faster training than the H100, which uses FP8. This innovation delivers the accuracy of 16-bit precision with the speed and efficiency of 4-bit, setting a new standard for AI factor efficiency and scalability. The AI industry is quickly adopting this revolutionary technology with major players such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and OpenAI, as well as Cohere, Mistral, Kimi AI, Perplexity, Reflection, and Runway, all already embracing it. NVIDIA's performance leadership was further validated in the latest MLPerf Training benchmarks, where the GB200 delivered a clean sweep.\nBe on the lookout for the upcoming MLPerf inference results in September, which will include benchmarks based on the Blackwell Ultra. NVIDIA RTX PRO servers are in full production for the world's systems makers. These are air-cooled PCIe-based systems integrated seamlessly into standard IT environments and run traditional enterprise IT applications, as well as the most advanced agentic and physical AI applications. Nearly 90 companies, including many global leaders, are already adopting RTX PRO servers. Hitachi uses them for real-time simulation and digital twins, Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation, and Disney for immersive storytelling.\nAs enterprises modernize data centers, RTX PRO servers are poised to become a multi-billion dollar product line. Sovereign AI is one on the rise, as the nation's ability to develop its own AI using domestic infrastructure, data, and talent presents a significant opportunity for NVIDIA. NVIDIA is at the forefront of landmark initiatives across the UK and Europe. The European Union plans to invest EUR 20 billion to establish 20 AI factories across France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, including five gigafactories to increase its AI compute infrastructure by tenfold.\nIn the UK, the Isambard-AI supercomputer powered by NVIDIA was unveiled as the country's most powerful AI system, delivering 21 exaflops of AI performance to accelerate breakthroughs in fields of drug discovery and climate modeling. We are on track to achieve over $20 billion in Sovereign AI revenue this year, more than double that of last year. Networking delivered record revenue of $7.3 billion, and escalating demands of AI compute clusters necessitate high efficiency and low latency networking. This represents a 46% sequential and 98% year-on-year increase, with strong demand across Spectrum-X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink.\nOur Spectrum-X enhanced Ethernet solutions provide the highest throughput and lowest latency network for Ethernet AI workloads. Spectrum-X Ethernet delivered double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth, with annualized revenue exceeding $10 billion. At Hot Chips, we introduced Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, a technology designed to unify disparate data centers into gigascale AI superfactories. CoreWeave is an initial adopter of the solution, which is projected to double GPU-to-GPU communication speed.\nInfiniBand revenue nearly doubled sequentially, fueled by the adoption of XDR technology, which provides double the bandwidth improvement over its predecessor, especially valuable for the model builders. The world's fastest switch, NVLink, with 14x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5, delivered strong growth as customers deployed Grace Blackwell NVLink rack-scale systems. The positive reception to NVLink Fusion, which allows semi-custom AI infrastructure, has been widespread. Japan's upcoming FugakuNEXT will integrate Fujitsu's CPUs with our architecture via NVLink Fusion.\nIt will run a range of workloads, including AI supercomputing and quantum computing. FugakuNEXT joins a rapidly expanding list of leading quantum supercomputing and research centers running on NVIDIA's CUDA-Q quantum platform, including [UTEQ], AIST, NNF, and NERSC, supported by over 300 ecosystem partners, including AWS, Google Quantum AI, Quantinuum, QuEra, and PsiQuantum. Jetson Thor, our new robotics computing platform, is now available. Thor delivers an order of magnitude greater AI performance and energy efficiency than NVIDIA AGX Orin.\nIt runs the latest generative and reasoning AI models at the edge in real time, enabling state-of-the-art robotics. Adoption of NVIDIA's robotics full-stack platform is growing at rapid rate. Over 2 million developers and 1,000+ hardware-software applications and sensor partners are taking our platform to market. Leading enterprises across industries have adopted Thor, including Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon, Medtronic, and Meta. Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our data center platform.\nNVIDIA Omniverse, with Cosmos, is our data center physical AI digital twin platform built for development of robot and robotic systems. This quarter, we announced a major expansion of our partnership with Siemens to enable AI automatic factories leading European robotics companies, including Agile Robots, NEURA Robotics, and Universal Robots, are building their latest innovations with the Omniverse platform. Transitioning to a quick summary of our revenue by geography. China declined on a sequential basis to low single-digit percentage of data center revenue. Note, our Q3 outlook does not include H20 shipments to China customers.\nSingapore revenue represented 22% of Q2's billed revenue as customers have centralized their invoicing in Singapore. Over 99% of data center compute revenue billed to Singapore was for US-based customers. Our gaming revenue was a record. $4.3 billion, a 14% sequential increase, and a 49% jump year-on-year. This was driven by the ramp of Blackwell GeForce CPUs, as strong sales continued as we increased supply availability. This quarter, we shipped GeForce RTX 5060 desktop GPU. It brings double the performance, along with advanced ray tracing, neural rendering, and AI-powered DLSS 4 gameplay to millions of gamers worldwide.\nBlackwell is coming to GeForce NOW in September. This is GeForce NOW's most significant upgrade, offering RTX 5080-class performance, minimal latency, and 5K resolution at 120 frames per second. We are also doubling the GeForce NOW catalog to over 4,500 titles, the largest library of any cloud gaming service. For AI enthusiasts, on-device AI performs the best RTX GPUs. We partnered with OpenAI to optimize their open-source GPT models for high-quality, fast, and efficient inference on millions of RTX-enabled Windows devices. With the RTX platform stack, Windows developers can create AI applications designed to run on the world's largest AI PC user base.\nProfessional Visualization revenue reached $601 million, a 32% year-on-year increase. Growth was driven by an adoption of the high-end RTX workstation GPUs, and AI-powered workloads like design, simulation, and prototyping. Key customers are leveraging our solutions to accelerate their operations. Activision Blizzard uses RTX workstations to enhance creative workflows, while robotics innovator Figure AI powers its humanoid robots with RTX-embedded GPUs. Automotive revenue, which includes only in-car compute revenue, was $586 million, up 69% year-on-year, primarily driven by self-driving solutions.\nWe have begun shipments of NVIDIA Thor SoC, the successor to Orin. Thor's arrival coincides with the industry's accelerating shift to vision, language model architecture, generative AI, and higher levels of autonomy. Thor is the most successful robotics and AV computer we've ever created. Thor will power our full-stack DRIVE AV software platform, which is now in production, opening up billions to new revenue opportunities for NVIDIA while improving vehicle safety and autonomy. Now moving to the rest of our P&L. GAAP gross margin was 72.4%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 72.7%.\nThese figures include a $180 million, or 40 basis point, benefit from releasing previously reserved H20 inventory. Excluding this benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 72.3%, still exceeding our outlook. GAAP operating expenses rose 8% and 6% on a non-GAAP basis sequentially. This increase was driven by higher compute and infrastructure costs, as well as higher compensation and benefit costs. To support the ramp of Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, inventory increased sequentially from $11 billion to 15 billion in Q2.\nWhile we prioritized funding our growth and strategic initiatives in Q2, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cost dividends. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $60 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $14.7 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Okay, let me turn it to the outlook for the Q3. Total revenue is expected to be $54 billion, ±2%. This represents over $7 billion in sequential growth. Again, we do not assume any H20 shipments to China customers in our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, ±50 basis points.\nWe continue to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. For the full year, we expect operating expenses to grow in the high 30s range year-over-year, up from our prior expectations of the mid-30s. We are accelerating investments in the business to address the magnitude of growth opportunities that lie ahead. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and public-held equity securities.\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial data are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference on 8 September in San Francisco. Our annual NDR will commence the first part of October. GTC Data Center begins on 27 October with Jensen's keynote scheduled for the 28. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our Q3 of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for 19 November.\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Your first question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess with Wayfarer into rack out lead times of 12 months, you confirmed on the call today that Rubin is on track for ramping the second half. Obviously, many of these investments are multi-year projects contingent upon power, cooling, et cetera. I was hoping perhaps you could take a high-level view and speak to your vision for growth into 2026. As part of that, if you can kind of comment between network and data center, it would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, CJ. At the highest level, growth drivers would be the evolution, the introduction, if you will, of reasoning agentic AI. Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt and it would generate the answer. Now the AI does research. It thinks and does a plan, and it might use tools. It's called long thinking. The longer it thinks, oftentimes it produces better answers. The amount of computation necessary for one-shot versus reasoning agentic AI models could be 100x, 1,000x, and potentially even more as the amount of research and basically reading and comprehension that it goes off to do increases.\nThe amount of computation that has resulted in agentic AI has grown tremendously. Of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously. Because of agentic AI, the amount of hallucination has dropped significantly. You can now use it. You can now use tools and perform tasks. Enterprises have been opened up. As a result of agentic AI and vision language models, we now are seeing a breakthrough in physical AI and robotics, autonomous systems. The last year, AI has made tremendous progress. Agentic systems, reasoning systems, is completely revolutionary. Now, we built the Blackwell NVLink 72 system, a rack-scale computing system for this moment.\nWe've been working on it for several years. This last year, we transitioned from NVLink 8, which is a node-scale computing, each node is a computer, to now NVLink 72, where each rack is a computer. That disaggregation of NVLink 72 into a rack-scale system was extremely hard to do, but the results are extraordinary. We're seeing orders of magnitude speed up and therefore energy efficiency and therefore cost-effectiveness of token generation because of NVLink 72. Over the next couple of years, you're going to—well, you asked about longer term.\nOver the next five years, we're going to scale into, with Blackwell, with Rubin, and follow-ons, to scale into effectively a $3 to 4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity. The last couple of years, you have seen that CapEx has grown in just the top four CSPs, has doubled and grown to about $600 billion. We're in the beginning of this buildout. The AI technology advances have really enabled AI to be able to adopt and solve problems to many different industries.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my questions. Colette, just wanted to clarify the $2 to 5 billion in China, what needs to happen, and what is the sustainable pace of that China business as you get into Q4. Then, Jensen, for you on the competitive landscape, several of your large customers already have or are planning many ASIC projects. I think one of your ASIC competitors, Broadcom, signaled that they could grow their AI business almost 55%, 60% next year. Any scenario in which you see the market moving more towards ASICs and away from NVIDIA GPU? Just what are you hearing from your customers?\nHow are they managing this split between their use of merchant silicon and ASICs? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Vivek. Let me first answer your question regarding what will it take for the H20s to be shipped. There is interest in our H20s. There is the initial set of licenses that we received. Additionally, we do have a supply that we are ready, and that's why we communicated that somewhere in the range of about $2 to 5 billion this quarter, we could potentially ship. We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do. It's still open at this time, and we're not exactly sure what that full amount will be this quarter.\nHowever, if more interest arrives, more licenses arrive, again, we can also still build additional H20 and ship more as well.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA builds very different things than ASICs. Let's talk about ASICs first. A lot of projects are started. Many startup companies are created. Very few products go into production. The reason for that is it's really hard. Accelerated computing is unlike general-purpose computing. You don't write software and just compile it into a processor. Accelerated computing is a full-stack co-design problem. AI factories in the last several years have become so much more complex because of the scale of the problems that have grown so significantly. It's really the ultimate, the most extreme computer science problem the world's ever seen, obviously.\nThe stack is complicated. The models are changing incredibly fast, from generative based on autoregressive to generative based on diffusion, to mixed models, to multi-modality. The number of different models that are coming out that are either derivatives of transformers or evolutions of transformers is just daunting. One of the advantages that we have is that NVIDIA is available in every cloud. We're available from every computer company. We're available from the cloud to on-prem, to edge, to robotics on the same programming model. It's sensible that every framework in the world supports NVIDIA.\nWhen you're building a new model architecture, releasing it on NVIDIA is most sensible. The diversity of our platform, both in the ability to evolve into any architecture, the fact that we're everywhere, and also we accelerate the entire pipeline, everything from data processing to pre-training to post-training with reinforcement learning, all the way out to inference. When you build a data center with NVIDIA platform in it, the utility of it is best. The lifetime usefulness is much, much longer. I would just say that, in addition to all of that, it is just a really extremely complex systems problem anymore.\nPeople talk about the chip itself. There's one ASIC, the GPU, that many people talk about. In order to build Blackwell, the platform, and Rubin, the platform, we had to build CPUs that connect fast memory, low extremely energy-efficient memory for large KB caching necessary for agentic AI, to the GPU, to a SuperNIC, to a scale-up switch we call NVLink, completely revolutionary. We're in our fifth generation now. To a scale-out switch, whether it's Quantum or Spectrum-X Ethernet, to now scale across switches so that we could prepare for these AI superfactories with multiple gigawatts of computing all connected together.\nWe call that Spectrum-XGS. We just announced that at Hot Chips this week. The complications, the complexity of everything that we do, is really quite extraordinary. It's just done at a really, really extreme scale now. Lastly, if I could just say one more thing, we're in every cloud for a good reason. Not only are we the most energy-efficient, our perf per watt is the best of any computing platform. In a world of power-limited data centers, perf per watt drives directly to revenues. You've heard me say before that in a lot of ways, the more you buy, the more you grow. Because our perf per dollar, the performance per dollar, is so incredible, you also have extremely great margins.\nThe growth opportunity with NVIDIA's architecture and the gross margins opportunity with NVIDIA's architecture is absolutely the best. There are a lot of reasons why NVIDIA is chosen by every cloud, every startup, and every computer company. We're really a holistic, full-stack solution for AI factories.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask you about your $3 to 4 trillion in data center infrastructure spend by the end of the decade. Previously, you talked about something in the $1 billion range, which I believe was just for compute by 2028. If you take past comments, $3 to 4 trillion would imply maybe $2 billion plus in compute spend. Just wanted to know if that was right and that's what you're seeing by the end of the decade, and wondering what you think your share will be of that. Your share right now of total infrastructure, compute-wise, is very high. Wanted to see, and also if there's any bottlenecks you're concerned about, like power, to get to the $3 to 4 trillion. Thanks a lot.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks. As you know, the CapEx of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years. As the AI revolution went into full steam, as the AI race is now on, the CapEx spend has doubled to $600 billion per year. There are five years between now and the end of the decade, and $600 billion only represents the top four hyperscalers. We still have the rest of the enterprise companies building on-prem. You have cloud service providers building around the world. The United States represents about 60% of the world's compute. Over time, you would think that artificial intelligence would reflect GDP scale and growth, and would be, of course, accelerating GDP growth.\nOur contribution to that. Is a large part of the AI infrastructure. Out of a gigawatt AI factory, which can go anywhere from $50 billion to, you know, ±10%, let's say $50 billion to 60 billion. We represent about 35%±, of that. And 35% out of $50 or so billion for a gigawatt data center. Of course, what you get for that is not a GPU. I think people were famous for building the GPU and inventing the GPU. But as you know, over the last decade, we've really transitioned to become an AI infrastructure company. It takes six different types of chips just to build a Rubin AI supercomputer. Just to scale that out to a gigawatt, you have hundreds of thousands of GPU compute nodes and a whole bunch of racks.\nWe're really an AI infrastructure company. We're hoping to continue to contribute to growing this industry, making AI more useful, and then, very importantly, driving the performance per watt because the world, as you mentioned, limiters, it will always likely be power limitations or AI building limitations. We need to squeeze as much out of that factory as possible. NVIDIA's performance per unit of energy used drives the revenue growth of that factory. It directly translates. If you have a 100 MW factory, perf per 100 MW drives your revenues. It's tokens per 100 MW of factory.\nIn our case, also, the performance per dollar spent is so high that your gross margins are also the best. Anyhow, these are the limiters going forward. $3 to 4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next five years.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Congratulations on reopening the China opportunity. Can you talk about the long-term prospects there? You've talked about, I think, half of the AI software world being there. How much can NVIDIA grow in that business? How important is it that you get the Blackwell architecture ultimately licensed there?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe China market, I've estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year if we were able to address it with competitive products. If it's $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year as the rest of the world's AI market is growing as well. It is the second largest computing market in the world. It is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China. The vast majority of the leading open-source models are created in China. It's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market. Open source, as you know, is created in one country, but it's used all over the world.\nThe open-source models that have come out of China are really excellent. DeepSeek, of course, gained global notoriety. Q1 is excellent. Kimi is excellent. There's a whole bunch of new models that are coming out. They're multimodal. They're great language models. It's really fueled the adoption of AI in enterprises around the world because enterprises want to build their own custom proprietary software stacks. Open-source model is really important for enterprise. It's really important for SaaS, who also would like to build proprietary systems. It has been really incredible for robotics around the world.\nOpen source is really important. It's important that the American companies are able to address it. It's going to be a very large market. We're talking to the administration about the importance of American companies to be able to address the Chinese market. As you know, H20 has been approved for companies that are not on the entities list, and many licenses have been approved. I think the opportunity for us to bring Blackwell to the China market is a real possibility. We just have to keep advocating the sensibility of and the importance of American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race and help make the American tech stack the global standard.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thank you for the question. I want to go back to the Spectrum-XGS announcement this week. Thinking about the Ethernet product now pushing over $10 billion of annualized revenue, Jensen, what is the opportunity set that you see for Spectrum-XGS? Do we think about this as kind of the data center interconnect layer? Any thoughts on the sizing of this opportunity within that Ethernet portfolio? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWe now offer three networking technologies. One is for scale-up, one is for scale-out, and one for scale-across. Scale-up is so that we could build the largest possible virtual GPU, the virtual compute node. NVLink is revolutionary. NVLink 72 is what made it possible for Blackwell to deliver such an extraordinary generational jump over Hopper's NVLink 8 at a time when we have long-thinking models, agentic AI reasoning systems. The NVLink basically amplifies the memory bandwidth, which is really critical for reasoning systems. NVLink 72 is fantastic. We then scale out with networking, which we have two.\nWe have InfiniBand, which is unquestionably the lowest latency, the lowest jitter, the best scale-out network. It does require more expertise in managing those networks. For supercomputing, for the leading model makers, InfiniBand, Quantum InfiniBand is the unambiguous choice. If you were to benchmark an AI factory, the ones with InfiniBand are the best performance. For those who would like to use Ethernet, because the whole data center is built with Ethernet, we have a new type of Ethernet called Spectrum Ethernet. Spectrum Ethernet is not off the shelf. It has a whole bunch of new technologies designed for low latency, low jitter, and congestion control.\nIt has the ability to come closer, much, much closer to InfiniBand than anything that's out there. That's why we call that Spectrum-X Ethernet. Finally, we have Spectrum-XGS, a gigascale for connecting multiple data centers, multiple AI factories into a super factory, a gigantic system. You're going to see that networking, obviously, is very important in AI factories. In fact, choosing the right networking, the performance, the throughput improvement, going from 65% to 85% or 90%, that kind of step-up because of your networking capability effectively makes networking free. Choosing the right networking, you're basically paying.\nYou'll get a return on it like you can't believe because the AI factory, a gigawatt, as I mentioned before, could be $50 billion. The ability to improve the efficiency of that factory by tens of percent results in $10 to 20 billion worth of effective benefit. The networking is a very important part of it. It's the reason why NVIDIA dedicates so much in networking. It's the reason why we purchased Mellanox five and a half years ago. Spectrum-X, as we mentioned earlier, is now quite a sizable business, and it's only about a year and a half old. Spectrum-X is a home run.\nAll three of them are going to be fantastic: NVLink, scale-up; Spectrum-X and InfiniBand, scale-out; and then Spectrum-XGS for scale-across.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a more tactical question for Colette. On the guide, you're up over $7 billion. The vast bulk of that is going to be from data center. How do I think about apportioning that $7 billion out across Blackwell versus Hopper versus networking? I mean, it looks like Blackwell was probably $27 billion in the quarter, up from maybe $23 billion last quarter. Hopper's still $6 or 7 billion post the H20. Do you think the Hopper strength continues? How do I think about parsing that $7 billion out across those three different components?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Stacy, for the question. First part of it, looking at our growth between Q2 and Q3, Blackwell is still going to be the lion's share of what we have in terms of data center. Keep in mind, that helps both our compute side, as well as it helps our networking side, because we are selling those significant systems that are incorporating the NVLink that Jensen just spoke about. Selling Hopper, we are still selling it. H100, H200s, we are. They are HDX systems, and I still believe our Blackwell will be the lion's share of what we're doing on there. We'll continue. We don't have any more specific details in terms of how we'll finish our quarter.\nYou should expect Blackwell, again, to be the driver of the growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nVice President, Credit Trading, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've been very clear about the reasoning model opportunity that you see, and you've also been relatively clear about the technical specs for Rubin. Maybe you could provide a little bit of context about how you view the Rubin product transition going forward. What incremental capability does that offer to customers? Would you say that Rubin is a bigger, smaller, or similar step up in terms of performance from a capability perspective relative to what we saw at Blackwell? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks. Rubin. Rubin, we're on an annual cycle. The reason why we're on an annual cycle is because we can do so to accelerate the cost reduction and maximize the revenue generation for our customers. When we increase the perf per watt, the token generation per amount of usage of energy, we are effectively driving the revenues of our customers. The perf per watt of Blackwell will be, for reasoning systems, an order of magnitude higher than Hopper. For the same amount of energy, and everybody's data center is energy-limited by definition. For any data center, using Blackwell, you'll be able to maximize your revenues.\nCompared to anything we've done in the past, compared to anything in the world today. Because the perf per dollar, the performance is so good that the perf per dollar invested in the capital would also allow you to improve your gross margins. To the extent that we have great ideas for every single generation, we could improve the revenue generation, improve the AI capability, improve the margins of our customers by releasing new architectures. We advise our partners, our customers, to pace themselves and to build these data centers on an annual rhythm. Rubin is going to have a whole bunch of new ideas.\nI paused for a second because I've got plenty of time between now and a year from now to tell you about all the breakthroughs that Rubin's going to bring. Rubin has a lot of great ideas. I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now. I'll save it for GTC to tell you more and more about it. Nonetheless, for the next year, we're ramping really hard into now Grace Blackwell, GB200, and then now Blackwell Ultra, GB300. We're ramping really hard into data centers. This year is obviously a record-breaking year. I expect next year to be a record-breaking year.\nWhile we continue to increase the performance of AI capabilities as we race towards artificial superintelligence on the one hand, and continue to increase the revenue generation capabilities of our hyperscalers on the other hand.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask you, just answer the question. You threw out a number. You said 50% CAGR for the AI market. I'm wondering how much visibility that you have into next year. Is that kind of a reasonable bogey in terms of how much your data center revenue should grow next year? I would think you'll grow at least in line with that CAGR. Maybe, are there any puts and takes to that? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, I think the best way to look at it is we have reasonable forecasts from our large customers for next year, a very significant forecast. We still have a lot of businesses that we're still winning and a lot of startups that are still being created. Don't forget that the number of startups for AI-native startups was $100 billion was funded last year. This year, the year is not even over yet. It's $180 billion funded. If you look at. AI-native, the top AI-native startups that are generating revenues, last year was $2 billion. This year is $20 billion. Next year, being 10x higher than this year, is not inconceivable.\nThe open-source models are now opening up large enterprises, SaaS companies, industrial companies, and robotics companies to now join the AI revolution, another source of growth. Whether it's AI natives, enterprise SaaS, industrial AI, or startups, we're just seeing just an enormous amount of interest in AI and demand for AI. Right now, the buzz is, I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything sold out. H100 sold out. H200s are sold out. Large CSPs are coming out, renting capacity from other CSPs. The AI-native startups are really scrambling to get capacity so that they could train their reasoning models.\nThe demand is really, really high. The long-term outlook between where we are today, CapEx has doubled in two years. It is now running about $600 billion a year just in the large hyperscalers. For us to grow into that $600 billion a year, representing a significant part of that CapEx isn't unreasonable. I think the next several years, surely through the decade, we see just really fast-growing, really significant growth opportunities ahead. Let me conclude with this. Blackwell is the next-generation AI platform the world's been waiting for.\nIt delivers an exceptional generational leap. NVIDIA's NVLink 72 rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive order-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance requirement. Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and the demand is extraordinary. Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represent the Rubin platform. They've all taped out to TSMC. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack-scale AI supercomputer. We expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled-up supply chain.\nBlackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 to 4 trillion global AI factory build-out through the end of the decade. Customers are building ever-greater-scale AI factories, from thousands of Hopper GPUs in tens of megawatt data centers to now hundreds of thousands of Blackwells in 100 MW facilities. Soon, we'll be building millions of Rubin GPU platforms powering multi-gigawatt, multi-site AI superfactories. With each generation, demand only grows. One-shot chatbots have evolved into reasoning agentic AI that research, plan, and use tools, driving orders of magnitude jump in compute for both training and inference.\nAgentic AI is reaching maturity and has opened the enterprise market to build domain and company-specific AI agents for enterprise workflows, products, and services. The age of physical AI has arrived, unlocking entirely new industries in robotics and industrial automation. Every industrial company will need to build two factories, one to build the machines and another to build their robotic AI. This quarter, NVIDIA reached record revenues and an extraordinary milestone in our journey. The opportunity ahead is immense. A new industrial revolution has started. The AI race is on.\nThanks for joining us today, and I'll look forward to addressing you next week, next earnings call. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you, Toshiya. We delivered another strong quarter with revenue of $44 billion, up 69% year-over-year, exceeding our outlook in what proved to be a challenging operating environment. Data center revenue of $39 billion grew 73% year on year. AI workloads have transitioned strongly to inference, and AI factory buildouts are driving significant revenue. Our customers' commitments are firm. On April 9, the US government issued new export controls on H20, our data center GPU designed specifically for the China market. We sold H20 with the approval of the previous administration. Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory.\nIn Q1, we recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue, which occurred prior to April 9, but also recognized a $4.5 billion charge as we wrote down inventory and purchase obligations tied to orders we had received prior to April 9. We were unable to ship $2.5 billion in H20 revenue in the first quarter due to the new export controls. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to reuse certain materials. We are still evaluating our limited options to supply data center compute products compliant with the US government's revised export control rules. Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide.\nOur Blackwell RAM, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue. Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter, with a transition from Hopper nearly complete. The introduction of GB200 NVL was a fundamental architectural change to enable data center-scale workloads and to achieve the lowest cost per inference token. While these systems are complex to build, we have seen a significant improvement in manufacturing yields, and rack shipments are moving to strong rates to end customers. GB200 NVL racks are now generally available for model builders, enterprises, and sovereign customers to develop and deploy AI. On average, major hyperscalers are each deploying nearly 1,000 NVL 72 racks or 72,000 Blackwell GPUs per week and are on track to further ramp output this quarter.\nMicrosoft, for example, has already deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and is expected to ramp to hundreds of thousands of GB200s with OpenAI as one of its key customers. Key learnings from the GB200 ramp will allow for a smooth transition to the next phase of our product roadmap, Blackwell Ultra. Sampling of GB300 systems began earlier this month at the major CSPs, and we expect production shipments to commence later this quarter. GB300 will leverage the same architecture, same physical footprint, and the same electrical and mechanical specifications as GB200. The GB300 drop-in design will allow CSPs to seamlessly transition their systems and manufacturing used for GB200 while maintaining high yields. B300 GPUs with 50% more HBM will deliver another 50% increase in dense FP4 inference compute performance compared to the B200.\nWe remain committed to our annual product cadence, with our roadmap extending through 2028, tightly aligned with the multiple-year planning cycles of our customers. We are witnessing a sharp jump in inference demand. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are seeing a step-function leap in token generation. Microsoft processed over 100 trillion tokens in Q1, a five-fold increase on a year-over-year basis. This exponential growth in Azure OpenAI is representative of strong demand for Azure AI Foundry, as well as other AI services across Microsoft's platform. Inference-serving start-ups are now serving models using B200, tripling their token generation rate and corresponding revenues for high-value reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1, as reported by Artificial Analysis. NVIDIA Dynamo on Blackwell NVL72 turbocharges AI inference throughput by 30x for the new reasoning models sweeping the industry.\nDeveloper engagements increased, with adoption ranging from LLM providers such as Perplexity to financial services institutions such as Capital One, who reduced agentic chatbot latency by 5x with Dynamo. In the latest MLPerf Inference results, we submitted our first results using GB200 NVL72, delivering up to 30x higher inference throughput compared to our 8 GPU H200 submission on the challenging Llama 3.1 benchmark. This feat was achieved through a combination of tripling the performance per GPU, as well as 9x more GPUs, all connected on a single NVLink domain. While Blackwell is still early in its life cycle, software optimizations have already improved its performance by 1.5x in the last month alone. We expect to continue improving the performance of Blackwell through its operational life, as we have done with Hopper and Ampere. For example, we increased the inference performance of Hopper by 4x over two years.\nThis is the benefit of NVIDIA's programmable CUDA architecture and rich ecosystem. The pace and scale of AI factory deployments are accelerating, with nearly 100 NVIDIA-powered AI factories in flight this quarter, a twofold increase year-over-year, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. More AI factory projects are starting across industries and geographies. NVIDIA's full-stack architecture is underpinning AI factory deployments, as industry leaders like AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek, and Telenor are strategically vital sovereign clouds like those recently announced in Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and the UAE. We have a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of NVIDIA AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future. The transition from generative to [agentic AI], AI capable of perceiving, reasoning, planning, and acting, will transform every industry, every company, and country.\nWe envision AI agents as a new digital workforce capable of handling tasks ranging from customer service to complex decision-making processes. We introduced the Llama Nemotron family of open reasoning models designed to supercharge agentic AI platforms for enterprises. Built on the Llama architecture, these models are available as NIMs or NVIDIA inference microservices with multiple sizes to meet diverse deployment needs. Our post-training enhancements have yielded a 20% accuracy boost and a 5x increase in inference speed. Leading platform companies, including Accenture, Cadence, Deloitte, and Microsoft, are transforming work with our reasoning models. NVIDIA NeMo microservices are generally available across industries that are being leveraged by leading enterprises to build, optimize, and scale AI applications. With NeMo, Cisco increased model accuracy by 40% and improved response time by 10x in its code assistant. Nasdaq realized a 30% improvement in accuracy and response time in its AI platform's search capabilities.\nShell's custom LLM achieved a 30% increase in accuracy when trained with NVIDIA NeMo. NeMo's parallelism techniques accelerated model training time by 20% when compared to other frameworks. We also announced a partnership with Yum! Brands, the world's largest restaurant company, to bring NVIDIA AI to 500 of its restaurants this year, expanding to 61,000 restaurants over time to streamline order taking, optimize operations, and enhance service across its restaurants. For AI-powered cybersecurity, leading companies like Check Point, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA's AI security and software stack to build, optimize, and secure agentic workflows, with CrowdStrike realizing 2x faster detection triage with 50% less compute cost. Moving to networking, sequential growth in networking resumed in Q1, with revenue up 64% quarter-over quarter to $5 billion. Our customers continue to leverage our platform to efficiently scale up and scale out AI factory workloads.\nWe created the world's fastest switch, NVLink, for scale-up. Our NVLink compute fabric in its fifth-generation offers 14x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5. NVLink-72 carries 130 TB per second of bandwidth in a single rack, equivalent to the entirety of the world's peak Internet traffic. NVLink is a new growth vector and is off to a great start, with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. At Computex, we announced NVLink Fusion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CPUs and accelerators that connect directly to the NVIDIA platform with NVLink. We are now enabling key partners, including ASIC providers such as MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies, and Astera Labs, as well as CPU suppliers such as Fujitsu and Qualcomm, to leverage NVLink Fusion to connect our respective ecosystems. For scale-out, our enhanced Ethernet offerings deliver the highest throughput, lowest latency networking for AI.\nSpectrumX posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth and is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue. Adoption is widespread across major CSPs and consumer Internet companies, including CoreWeave, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, and xAI. This quarter, we added Google Cloud and Meta to the growing list of SpectrumX customers. We introduced SpectrumX and QuantumX silicon photonics switches, featuring the world's most advanced co-packaged optics. These platforms will enable next-level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs through the increasing power efficiency by 3.5x and network resiliency by 10x, while accelerating customer time to market by 1.3x. Transitioning to a quick summary of our revenue by geography. China, as a percentage of our data center revenue, was slightly below our expectations and down sequentially due to H20 export licensing controls. For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue.\nAs a reminder, while Singapore represented nearly 20% of our Q1 build revenue, as many of our large customers use Singapore for centralized invoicing, our products are almost always sold elsewhere. Note that over 99% of H100, H200, and Blackwell data center compute revenue billed to Singapore was for orders from US-based customers. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue was a record $3.8 billion, increasing 48% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. Strong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts have made Blackwell our fastest ramp ever. Against a backdrop of robust demand, we greatly improved our supply and availability in Q1 and expect to continue these efforts in Q2. AI is transforming PC and creators and gamers. With a 100 million user installed base, GeForce represents the largest footprint for PC developers.\nThis quarter, we added to our AI PC laptop offerings, including models capable of running Microsoft's Copilot Plus. This past quarter, we brought Blackwell architecture to mainstream gaming with its launch of GeForce RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, starting at just $299. The RTX 5060 also debuted in laptops, starting at $1,099. These systems that doubled the frame rate and slashed latency. These GeForce RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti desktop GPUs and laptops are now available. In console gaming, the recently unveiled Nintendo Switch 2 leverages NVIDIA's neural rendering and AI technologies, including next-generation custom RTX GPUs with DLSS technology, to deliver a giant leap in gaming performance to millions of players worldwide. Nintendo has shipped over 150 million Switch consoles to date, making it one of the most successful gaming systems in history. Moving to ProVisualization, revenue of $509 million was flat sequentially and up 19% year-on-year.\nTariff-related uncertainty temporarily impacted Q1 systems, and demand for our AI workstations is strong, and we expect sequential revenue growth to resume in Q2. NVIDIA DGX Spark and Station revolutionized personal computing by putting the power of an AI supercomputer in a desktop form factor. DGX Spark delivers up to one petaflop of AI compute, while DGX Station offers an incredible 20 petaflops and is powered by the GB300 Superchip. DGX Spark will be available in calendar Q3, and DGX Station later this year. We have deepened Omniverse's integration and adoption into some of the world's leading software platforms, including Databricks, SAP, and Schneider Electric. New Omniverse blueprints, such as Mega for at-scale robotic fleet management, are being leveraged in KION Group, Pegatron, Accenture, and other leading companies to enhance industrial operations. At Computex, we showcased Omniverse's great traction with technology manufacturing leaders, including TSMC, Quanta, Foxconn, and Pegatron.\nUsing Omniverse, TSMC saves months in work by designing fabs virtually. Foxconn accelerates thermal simulations by 150x, and Pegatron reduced assembly line defect rates by 67%. Lastly, with our automotive group, revenue was $567 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers, and robust demand for NEVs. We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using NVIDIA AI simulation and accelerated computing. We are now in production with our full-stack solution for Mercedes-Benz, starting with the new CLA, hitting roads in the next few months. We announced Isaac GR00T and won the world's first open, fully customizable foundation model for humanoid robots, enabling generalized reasoning and skill development. We also launched new open NVIDIA Cosmos World Foundation models. Leading companies include 1X, Agility Robotics, Figure, Uber, and Robbie.\nWe've begun integrating Cosmos into their operations for synthetic data generation, while Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, and XPENG Robotics are harnessing Isaac simulation to advance their humanoid efforts. GE Healthcare is using the new NVIDIA Isaac platform for healthcare simulation. Built on NVIDIA Omniverse and using NVIDIA Cosmos, the platform speeds development of robotic imaging and surgery systems. The era of robotics is here. Billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories and warehouses will be developed. All right, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61%, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge, Q1 non-GAAP gross margins would have been 71.3%, slightly above our outlook at the beginning of the quarter. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 7%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 6%, reflecting higher compensation and employee growth.\nOur investments include expanding our infrastructure capabilities and AI solutions, and we plan to grow these investments throughout the fiscal year. In Q1, we returned a record $14.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our capital return program continues to be a key element of our capital allocation strategy. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $45 billion, ±2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In data center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue. Note, our outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion for the second quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72%, respectively, ±50 basis points. We expect better Blackwell profitability to drive modest sequential improvement in gross margins.\nWe are continuing to work towards achieving gross margins in the mid-70s range late this year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4 billion, respectively, and we continue to expect full year, fiscal year 2026 operating expense growth to be in the mid-30% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $450 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website, including a new financially information AI agent. Let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.\nWe will be at the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 4, the Rosenblatt Virtual AI Summit and Nasdaq Investor Conference in London on June 10, and GTC Paris at VivaTech on June 11 in Paris. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for August 27. Well, now let me turn it over to Jensen to make some remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Colette. We've had a busy and productive year. Let me share my perspective on some topics we're frequently asked. On export control. China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success. With half of the world's AI researchers based there, the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally.\nToday, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China. We cannot reduce Hopper further to comply. As a result, we are taking a multi-billion dollar write-off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. We are exploring limited ways to compete, but Hopper is no longer an option. China's AI moves on with or without US chips. It has to compute to train and deploy advanced models. The question is not whether China will have AI. It already does. The question is whether one of the world's largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chip makers from US competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position. Export restrictions have spurred China's innovation and scale. The AI race is not just about chips, it's about which stack the world runs on.\nAs that stack grows to include 6G and quantum, US global infrastructure leadership is at stake. The US has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it's clearly wrong. China has enormous manufacturing capability. In the end, the platform that wins the AI developers wins AI. Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals. On DeepSeek. DeepSeek and Qwen from China are among the best open-source AI models. Released freely, they've gained traction across the US, Europe, and beyond. DeepSeek R1, like ChatGPT, introduced reasoning AI that produces better answers the longer it thinks. Reasoning AI enables step-by-step problem-solving, planning, and tool use, turning models into intelligent agents. Reasoning is compute-intensive, requires hundreds to thousands of times more tokens per task than previous one-shot inference.\nReasoning models are driving a step function surge in inference demand. AI scaling laws remain firmly intact, not only for training, but now inference too requires massive-scale compute. DeepSeek also underscores the strategic value of open-source AI. When popular models are trained and optimized on US platforms, it drives usage, feedback, and continuous improvement, reinforcing American leadership across the stack. US platforms must remain the preferred platform for open-source AI. That means supporting collaboration with top developers globally, including in China. America wins when models like DeepSeek and Qwen run best on American infrastructure. Regarding onshore manufacturing, President Trump has outlined a bold vision to reshore advanced manufacturing, create jobs, and strengthen national security. Future plants will be highly computerized in robotics. We share this vision. TSMC is building six fabs and two advanced packaging plants in Arizona to make chips for NVIDIA.\nProcess qualification is underway, with volume production expected by year-end. SPILL and Amkor are also investing in Arizon, constructing packaging, assembly, and test facilities. In Houston, we're partnering with Foxconn to construct a million-square-foot factory to build AI supercomputers. Wistron is building a similar plant in Fort Worth, Texas. To encourage and support these investments, we've made substantial long-term purchase commitments, a deep investment in America's AI manufacturing future. Our goal, from chip to supercomputer, built in America within a year. Each GB200 NVLink-72 rack contains 1.2 million components and weighs nearly 2 tons. No one has produced supercomputers on this scale. Our partners are doing an extraordinary job. On AI diffusion rule, President Trump rescinded the AI diffusion rule, calling it counterproductive, and proposed a new policy to promote US AI tech with trusted partners. On his Middle East tour, he announced historic investments.\nI was honored to join him in announcing a 500 MW AI infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia and a 5 GW AI campus in the UAE. President Trump wants US tech to lead. The deals he announced are wins for America, creating jobs, advancing infrastructure, generating tax revenue, and reducing the US trade deficit. The US will always be NVIDIA's largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure. Every nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution, a new industry that produces intelligence and essential infrastructure for every economy. Countries are racing to build national AI platforms to elevate their digital capabilities. At Computex, we announced Taiwan's first AI factory in partnership with Foxconn and the Taiwan government. Last week, I was in Sweden to launch its first national AI infrastructure.\nJapan, Korea, India, Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, and more are now building national AI factories to empower startups, industries, and societies. Sovereign AI is a new growth engine for NVIDIA. Toshiya, back to you. Thank you.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, NVIDIA\n\nOperator, we will now open the call for questions. Would you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. You guys have talked about this scaling up of inference around reasoning models for at least a year now, and we've really seen that come to fruition, as you talked about. We've heard it from your customers.\nCan you give us a sense for how much of that demand you're able to serve? Give us a sense for maybe how big the inference business is for you guys, and do we need full-on NVL72 rack scale solutions for reasoning inference going forward?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, we would like to serve all of it. I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink-72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100,000x more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step by step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer.\nIt could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. What we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40x higher speed and throughput. This is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. That's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink-72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign, the entire way that these supercomputers are built.\nNow we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for the question. Just a clarification for Colette first. On the China impact, I think previously it was mentioned that at about $15 billion, you had the $8 billion in Q2. Is there still some left as a headwind for the remaining quarters, just Colette, how to model that? Question, Jensen, for you. Back at GTC, you had outlined a path towards almost a trillion dollars of AI spending over the next few years. Where are we in that build-out? Do you think it's going to be uniform, that you will see every spender, whether it's CSP, sovereign, enterprises, or build-out? Should we expect some periods of digestion in between?\nWhat are your customer discussions telling you about how to model growth for next year?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYes, Vivek, thanks so much for the question regarding H20. Yes, we recognized $4.6 billion H20 in Q1. We were unable to ship $2.5 billion, so the total for Q1 should have been $7 billion. When we look at our Q2, our Q2 is going to be meaningfully down in terms of China data center revenue. We had highlighted the amount of orders that we had planned for H20 in Q2, and that was $8 billion. Going forward, we did have other orders that we will not be able to fulfill. That is what was incorporated, therefore, in the amount that we wrote down of the $4.5 billion. That write-down was about inventory and purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments were about what we expected regarding the orders that we had received.\nGoing forward, though, it's a bigger issue regarding the amount of the market that we will not be able to serve. We assess that TAM to be close to about $50 billion in the future, as we don't have a product to enable for China.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nVivek, probably the best way to think through it is that AI is several things. Of course, we know that AI is this incredible technology that's going to transform every industry, from the way we do software to healthcare and financial services to retail, to, I guess, every industry, transportation, manufacturing. We're at the beginning of that. Maybe another way to think about that is, where do we need intelligence? Where do we need digital intelligence? Every country is in every industry. We know. Because of that, we recognize that AI is also an infrastructure. It's a way of delivering a technology that requires factories.\nThese factories produce tokens, and they, as I mentioned, are important to every single industry and every single country. On that basis, we're really at the very beginning of it because the adoption of this technology is really kind of in its early stages. Now, we've reached an extraordinary milestone with AIs that are reasoning, are thinking. What people call inference time scaling. Of course, it created a whole new era. We've entered an era where inference is going to be a significant part of the compute workload. Anyhow, it's going to be a new infrastructure, and we're building it out in the clouds. The United States is really the early starter and available in US clouds. This is our largest market, our largest installed base, and we'll continue to see that happening.\nBeyond that, we're going to have to, we're going to see AI go into enterprise, which is on-prem, because so much of the data is still on-prem. Access control is really important. It's really hard to move every company's data into the cloud, and so we're going to move AI into the enterprise. You saw that we announced a couple of really exciting new products: our RTX Pro enterprise AI server that runs everything enterprise and AI, our DGX Spark and DGX Station, which is designed for developers who want to work on-prem. Enterprise AI is just taking off. Telcos. Today, a lot of the telco infrastructure will be, in the future, software-defined and built on AI. 6G is going to be built on AI, and that infrastructure needs to be built out. It's at its very, very early stages.\nOf course, every factory today that makes things will have an AI factory that sits with it. The AI factory is going to be creating AI and operating AI for the factory itself, but also to power the products and the things that are made by the factory. It's very clear that every car company will have AI factories. Very soon, there will be robotics companies, robot companies, and those companies will be also building AIs to drive the robots. We're at the beginning of all of this build-out.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question.\nThere have been many large GPU cluster investment announcements in the last month, and you alluded to a few of them with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and then also we've heard from Oracle and xAI, just to name a few. My question, are there others that have yet to be announced of the same kind of scale and magnitude? Perhaps more importantly, how are these orders impacting your lead times for Blackwell and your current visibility sitting here today, almost halfway through 2025?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, we have more orders today than we did at the last time I spoke about orders at GTC. However, we're also increasing our supply chain and building out our supply chain. They're doing a fantastic job. We're building it here onshore in the United States, but we're going to keep our supply chain quite busy for many more years coming.\nWith respect to further announcements, I'm going to be on the road next week through Europe. Just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure, and there are umpteen AI factories being planned. I think in the remarks Colette mentioned there's 100 AI factories being built. There's a whole bunch that haven't been announced. I think the important concept here, which makes it easier to understand, is that like other technologies that impact literally every single industry—of course, electricity was one, and it became infrastructure. Of course, the information infrastructure, which we now know as the internet, affects every single industry, every country, every society. Intelligence is surely one of those things. I don't know any company, industry, country who thinks that intelligence is optional. It's essential infrastructure. We've now digitalized intelligence, and so I think we're clearly in the beginning of the build-out of this infrastructure.\nEvery country will have it, I'm certain of that. Every industry will use it, that I'm certain of. What's unique about this infrastructure is that it needs factories. It's a little bit like the energy infrastructure, electricity. It needs factories. We need factories to produce this intelligence, and the intelligence is getting more sophisticated. We were talking about earlier that we had a huge breakthrough in the last couple of years with reasoning AI, and now there are agents that reason, and there are super agents that use a whole bunch of tools. Then there are clusters of super agents where agents are working with agents, solving problems. You could just imagine, compared to one-shot chatbots and the agents that are now using AI built on these large language models, how much more compute-intensive they really need to be and are.\nI think we're in the beginning of the build-out, and there should be many, many more announcements in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question. Excuse me. Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask first to Colette just a little clarification around the guidance and maybe putting it in a different way. The $8 billion for H20 just seems like it's roughly $3 billion more than most people thought with regard to what you'd be foregoing in the second quarter. That would mean that with regard to your guidance, the rest of the business, in order to hit $45 billion, is doing $2 billion-$3 billion or so better. I was wondering if that math made sense to you.\nIn terms of the guidance, that would imply the non-China business is doing a bit better than the street expected. Wondering what the primary driver was there in your view. This second part of my question, Jensen, I know you guide one quarter at a time, but with regard to the AI diffusion rule being lifted and this momentum with Sovereign, there's been times in your history where you guys have sat on calls like this where you have more conviction in sequential growth throughout the year, etc. Given the unleashing of demand with AI diffusion being revoked and the supply chain increasing, does the environment give you more conviction in sequential growth as we go throughout the year? First one for Colette, and then next one for Jensen. Thanks so much.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Ben, for the question.\nWhen we look at our Q2 guidance and our commentary that we provided, had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20. That's correct. That was a possibility for what we would have had in our outlook for this quarter in Q2. What we also have talked about here is the growth that we've seen in Blackwell, Blackwell across many of our customers, as well as the growth that we continue to have in terms of supply that we need for our customers. Putting those together, that's where we came through with the guidance that we provided. I'm going to turn the rest over to Jensen to see how he wants to.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks. Thanks, Ben. I would say compared to the beginning of the year, compared to GTC timeframe, there are four positive surprises.\nThe first positive surprise is the step function demand increase of reasoning AI. I think it is fairly clear now that AI is going through an exponential growth, and reasoning AI really busted through concerns about hallucination or its ability to really solve problems. I think a lot of people are crossing that barrier and realizing how incredibly effective agentic AI is and reasoning AI is. Number one is inference reasoning and the exponential growth there, demand growth. The second one, you mentioned AI diffusion. It's really terrific to see that the AI diffusion rule was rescinded. President Trump wants America to win, and he also realizes that we're not the only country in the race. He wants the United States to win and recognizes that we have to get the American stack out to the world and have the world build on top of American stacks instead of alternatives.\nAI diffusion happened, the rescinding of it happened at almost precisely the time that countries around the world are awakening to the importance of AI as an infrastructure, not just as a technology of great curiosity and great importance, but infrastructure for their industries, startups, and society. Just as they had to build out infrastructure for electricity and internet, you got to build out infrastructure for AI. I think that that's an awakening, and that creates a lot of opportunity. The third is enterprise AI. Agents work, and agents are doing, these agents are really quite successful. Much more than generative AI, agentic AI is game-changing. Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem-solve and use tools and have memory and so on. I think this is, enterprise AI is ready to take off.\nIt's taken us a few years to build a computing system that is able to integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to it. This is the RTX Pro enterprise server that we announced at Computex just last week. Just about every major IT company has joined us, super excited about that. Computing is one part of it, but remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars. It's compute, storage, and networking, and we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that. Lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of. The world reordering, if you will, is regions onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world.\nAll of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. This fourth pillar is quite important. Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. In order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. Back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. These four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Colette. Jensen, I wanted to ask about China. It sounds like the July guidance assumes there's no SKU replacement for the H20, but if the president wants the US to win, it seems like you're going to have to be allowed to ship something into China.\nI guess I had two points on that. First of all, have you been approved to ship a new modified version into China, and you're currently building it, but you just can't ship it in fiscal Q2? You were sort of run rating $7 billion-$8 billion a quarter into China. Can we get back to those sorts of quarterly run rates once you get something that you're allowed to ship back into China? I think we're all trying to figure out how much to add back to our models and when. Whatever you can say there would be great. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe president has a plan. He has a vision, and I trust him. With respect to our export controls, it's a set of limits. The new set of limits pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further for any productive use.\nThe new limits, it's kind of the end of the road for Hopper. We have limited options. The key is to understand the limits. The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it. We're thinking about it. Obviously, the limits are quite stringent at the moment. We have nothing to announce today. When the time comes, we'll engage the administration and discuss that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, this is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the great quarter.\nI was wondering if you could give some additional color around the strength you saw within the networking business, particularly around the adoption of your Ethernet solutions at CSPs, as well as any change you're seeing in network attach rates.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thank you for that. We now have three networking platforms, maybe four. The first one is the scale-up platform to turn a computer into a much larger computer. Scaling up is incredibly hard to do. Scaling out is easier to do, but scaling up is hard to do. That platform is called NVLink. NVLink comes with it chips and switches and NVLink spines, and it's really complicated. Anyways, that's our new platform, scale-up platform. In addition to InfiniBand, we also have SpectrumX. We've been fairly consistent that Ethernet was designed for a lot of traffic that are independent.\nIn the case of AI, you have a lot of computers working together, and the traffic of AI is insanely bursty. Latency matters a lot because the AI is thinking, and it wants to get work done as quickly as possible. You got a whole bunch of nodes working together, and so we enhanced Ethernet, added capabilities like extremely low latency, congestion control, adaptive routing, the type of technologies that were available only in InfiniBand, to Ethernet. As a result, we improved the utilization of Ethernet in these clusters. These clusters are gigantic, from as low as 50% to as high as 85%, 90%. The difference is if you had a cluster that's $10 billion, and you improved its effectiveness by 40%, that's worth $4 billion. It's incredible. SpectrumX has been really, quite frankly, a home run.\nThis last quarter, as we said in the prepared remarks, we added two very significant CSPs to the SpectrumX adoption. The last one is BlueField, which is our control plane. In those four, the control plane, the network, which is used for storage, is used for security, and for many of these clusters that want to achieve isolation among its users, multi-tenant clusters, and still be able to use and have extremely high-performance bare metal performance, BlueField is ideal for that and is used in a lot of these cases. We have these four networking platforms that are all growing, and we're doing really well. I'm very proud of the team.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, NVIDIA\n\nJensen, over to you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat is all the time we have for questions. Jensen and I will turn the call back to you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you. This is the start of a powerful new wave of growth.\nGrace Blackwell is in full production. We're off to the races. We now have multiple significant growth engines. Inference. Once the lighter workload is surging with revenue-generating AI services. AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the internet, mobile, and cloud. Blackwell is built to power the full AI lifecycle, from training frontier models to running complex inference and reasoning agents at scale. Training demands continue to rise with breakthroughs in post-training and reinforcement learning, and synthetic data generation. Inference is exploding. Reasoning AI agents require orders of magnitude more compute. The foundations of our next growth platforms are in place and ready to scale. Sovereign AI nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and internet. Enterprise AI, AI must be deployable on-prem and integrated with existing IT.\nOur RTX Pro, DGX Spark, and DGX Station enterprise AI systems are ready to modernize the $500 billion IT infrastructure on-prem or in the cloud. Every major IT provider is partnering with us. Industrial AI, from training to digital twin simulation to deployment, NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac GR00T are powering next-generation factories and humanoid robotic systems worldwide. The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI, and industrial AI. NVIDIA is ready. Join us at GTC Paris. I'll keynote at VivaTech on June 11, talking about quantum GPU computing, robotic factories, and robots, and celebrate our partnerships building AI factories across the region. The NVIDIA band will tour France, the UK, Germany, and Belgium. Thank you for joining us at the earnings call today. See you in Paris.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year, well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5x. Networking revenue grew more than 2x from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% of our data center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer internet and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell.\nKey workloads driving our data center growth include generative AI, model training and inferencing, video, image, and text data, pre- and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10-20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise, healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud.\nCSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer internet, and enterprise companies. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture, offering over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership, with both NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell platforms combining to win gold medals on all tasks.\nAt COMPUTEX, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, NVLink, NVLink switch, and the networking chips, systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL-72 system with the fifth generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability to run trillion-parameter models in real time. Hopper demand is strong, and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yields.\nBlackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year 2026. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially, with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including xAI, to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6x the performance of traditional Ethernet.\nWe plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure as national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI bridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies.\nA range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual copilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake, who serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers, is working with NVIDIA to build copilots. Lastly, Wistron is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter, as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers.\nAutomotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption, and will grow as next generation AV models require significantly more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI Foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1 collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies, for the first time, can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use, and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications.\nNVIDIA NIMs accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowe's, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and eight times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM Agent Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM Agent Blueprints, enterprises can refine their AI applications over time, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM Agent Blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to enterprises.\nNVIDIA NIM and NIM Agent Blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise Software Platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS, and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs, gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue, and demand is strong and growing, and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI TOPS, and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designed from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games, and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI.\nNVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies, is available for RTX AI PCs. Mecha BREAK is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small language model, MiniTron-4B, optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow. Recently added RTX and DLSS titles include Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Dune: Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The GeForce Now library continues to expand with a total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to ProVisualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations.\nThe world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. Several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz, signed multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins of factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workflows, accelerating their ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers, such as the Coca-Cola Company. Moving to automotive and robotics. Revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions.\nAt the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Grand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at scale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Boston Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsic, Siemens, Skilled AI, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per share.\nOur Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, ±2%. Our third quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, ±50 basis points. As our data center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively.\nFull-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us and poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\nAs a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there's a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back-end packaging or anything else? I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite a change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing, what that means to your kind of revenue profile, and how are customers reacting to it?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary. We're sampling functional samples of Blackwell, Grace Blackwell, in a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at COMPUTEX. We're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers' and customers' customers' return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, what are you guys watching?\nWhat's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts CapEx? A quick follow-up, maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook, and how should we think about fiscal 2026? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship, I don't mean starting production, but shipping out. On the longer-term question, let's take a step back. You've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. The reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time.\nIt is slow to a crawl. Yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. If we do not have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you are seeing that. The answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing. What that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. In fact, this week, there is a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer.\nThat's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. It's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. The reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic-scale models, multi-trillion parameter models, and train it on, pre-train it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning. Which caused the generative AI revolution?\nNow, generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it, is because it's not just a feature, it's not just a capability, it's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers, what are our previous observations, and then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal AI is a bit of a universal function approximator, and it learns the function. You can learn the function of almost anything, anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. Now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science.\nIt's affecting how every layer of computing is done, from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms. The type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. There are several things that are happening in generative AI. The first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. They're still seeing, we're still all seeing, the benefits of scaling. Whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the data set to go train it. The amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. It's not unexpected to see that the next generation models could take 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation.\nWe have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. The first one is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. Surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year, so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is, although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT, image generators, and coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. Those are kind of the tip of the iceberg.\nWhat's below the iceberg are the largest computing systems in the world today, which are—you've heard me talk about this in the past—recommender systems moving from CPUs. It's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. Recommender systems, ad generation, custom ad generation, targeting ads at very large scale, and quite hyper-targeting, search, and user-generated content—these are all very large-scale applications that have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. Sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource, and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting.\nYou might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to, so many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their company. Then general robotics, the big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse. We are now able to work with just about every robotics company now to start thinking about, start building general robotics. You can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. We're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nToshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. More and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. Yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible. It seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. How long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? Can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activity is new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. It's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible. There are a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. The reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane.\nIt's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. Almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas data, data science toolkits like Pandas and the new one, Polars. These are the most popular data processing platforms in the world. Aside from CPUs, which, as I've mentioned before, are really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. That's number one, the number one use case long before generative AI came along, is the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers, renting it to startup companies.\nA generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. These companies need it now. They just simply can't afford you just raise money. They want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year. You got to do it today. There's a fair that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to be gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. The second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same.\nThe ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that. We show that to the world in the GPUs we make, the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best, and that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future, and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see all that come true. These model makers are the same. Of course, they want to be the world's best. They want to be the world's first.\nAlthough Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. Between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. Everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure. Even Hopper, of course, H200 is state of the art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. I think people are just clamoring to transition the trillion dollars of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure. Hopper is state of the art.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Jensen, I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about, I don't know, the ROI on all of this CapEx. Hopefully, this question and the distinction will make some sense. What I'm having discussions about is the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability. They're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company, versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI.\nI don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology, and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI computing infrastructure investment you can make today. One way to think through it, probably the easiest way to think through it, is just go back to first principles. You have a trillion dollars' worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. The question is, do you want to build more of that or not? For every billion dollars' worth of general-purpose CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than a billion.\nBecause it's commoditized, there's already a trillion dollars on the ground. What's the point of getting more? The people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. The reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money. Data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. Recommender systems save money, so on and so forth. You start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up is going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. Your capacity gets rented right away, and the return on investment of that is really good. The third reason is your own business.\nYou want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system, a next-generation recommender system, or a next-generation search system. For your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. There are a lot of ways you could think through it. At the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing and NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth both near and longer term. I know, Colette, you did increase OpEx for the year. If I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling. I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp?\nI guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year, and you look into 2026, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nI'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. Remember, the world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. The world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs.\nThe reason for that is very clear because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next trillion dollars of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last trillion, and it'll be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell Classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta. I think it was Volta.\nWe've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go liquid-cooled is quite significant. The reason for that is because we can, in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center power-limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from three to five times the AI throughput compared to the past. Liquid cooling is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO, is better. Liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink, which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. Imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink. We're increasingly showing you the benefits of that.\nThe next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput, large language model inference. The large NVLink domain is going to be a game changer for that. I think people are very comfortable deploying both. Almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking forward, yeah, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry, and Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. As I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time.\nThat's just really, really important to keep your head on, your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing, and human-engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence-learned software. Okay?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4, is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well, on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars?\nThe second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, depending on where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? How should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYes. Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. We believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4.\nLet's say Hopper there for versus H100 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting of ramping in Q4. Hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provide a gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full year, also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. We're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4, again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there.\nWe don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nYeah. Hey. Thanks a lot for the question, Jensen and Colette. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out, and the United States was down sequentially, while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there. Obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks. What are the puts and takes? I just wanted to clarify from Stacey's question if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter given all those favorable revenue dynamics. Thanks.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nLet me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure, and a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. The piece is in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to. What you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may even travel to the end customer. These are just moving to our OEMs, our ODMs, and our system integrators, for the most part, across our product portfolio.\nWhat you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks, and those pieces of it. That shift happens from time to time. Yes, our China number there, our invoicing to China, keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, data center, and automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue, Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. Determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4.\nWe do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more given rising complexity and a radical limit in the advanced package world. Curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships, and then thinking through consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks. Let's see. I think the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing, so we want to continue to increase its scale. We believe that by continuing to scale the AI models, that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness, and that it would open up, I realize, the next industrial revolution. We believe it, and we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability, fairly uniquely, to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless you have all the parts.\nNext year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX DPU for east and west, BlueField DPUs for north and south, and data and storage processing, to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multi-billion-dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. The fact that we could build, we have access to all of this. We have one architectural stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens is you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to, and then you've got to build, somebody's got to build up an AI factory.\nThe AI factory has got a mountain of software. It's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to service ZT. They were recently purchased, and so on and so forth. The number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers. The scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrators, integrator supply chain is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. That part we don't want to do, and we're not good at doing. We know how to design the AI infrastructure, provide it the way that customers would like it, and let the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yeah. Anyways, that's the reason why.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about NVL72, and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle. I guess put distinctly, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system is designed and architected as a rack, but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. The reason for that is because everybody's rack is a little different, surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not, some of them are enterprise, and the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. The way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack, and then we provide the system components. For example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious, and we have MGX ODMs, integrators, and OEMs all over the planet.\nJust about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to it has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. Everything from the supply chain, from the moment that we ship the GPU CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. You could imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. I think because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration.\nOur customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value added. There's a final design in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but that design fit-in is really complicated. The design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair, repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. We have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. Integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. We don't want to be an integrator. We want to be a technology provider.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA",
    "content2": "Thank you. Let me make a couple of comments that I made earlier again.\nThe data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries. CuVS for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Aerial and Sionna for 5G wireless base station. A whole suite of a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing. AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated.\nWe are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a trillion dollars' worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one. Number two, Blackwell is a step function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's leap becomes clear. The Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize. The Grace CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU in a co-op package, ConnectX DPU for east-west traffic, BlueField DPU for north-south and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive burst traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers.\nNVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack, end-to-end, from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power, and cooling, and mountains of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal. Its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into one NVLink domain with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 TB per second in one rack. Just put that in perspective. That's about 10 times higher than Hopper.\n259 TB per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. That natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput, large-language model token generation. We now have three networking platforms: NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast, but it's just the tip of the iceberg.\nInternet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI startups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSPs' cloud capacity, and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, is opening up the next era of AI, general robotics. Now the enterprise AI wave has started, and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI enterprise platform consists of NeMo, NIMs, NIM agent blueprints, and AI Foundry that our ecosystem partners, the world-leading IT companies, use to help companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI enterprise runtime. At $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere.\nFor NVIDIA's software TAM, it can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU install base grows from millions to tens of millions. As Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion US dollars was up 18% sequentially, up 262% year-on-year, and well above our outlook of $24 billion US dollars. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $22.6 billion US dollars was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year-on-year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x, and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential data center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale, and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our data center revenue. Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud providers' investment.\nFor every $1 US dollars spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 US dollars in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem, and tight integration with cloud providers, makes it easy for end customers to get up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time-to-train models, the lowest cost to train models, and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in data center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs.\nTheir use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on vision. Video transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within data center this year, driving a multi-billion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Llama3 is openly available and has kickstarted a wave of AI development across industries.\nAs generative AI makes its way into more consumer internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity, as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our data center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs.\nFrom a geographic perspective, data center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million US dollars in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank, to build out the nation's sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer.\nIn Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DTX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. In Singapore, the National Supercomputer Center is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and a rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jumpstart their countries' AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require an export control license.\nOur data center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continued to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week.\nH200 nearly doubled the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama3, which, with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 US dollars spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama3 tokens can generate $7 US dollars in revenue over four years. With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 improves, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year.\nDemand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the ALPS supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe, Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the UK, and Jupiter in the Jülich Supercomputing Center in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace to Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the number one, the number two, and the number three spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nStrong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand new market to NVIDIA networking, and enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multi-billion dollar product line within a year.\nAt GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine, and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series, designed for a trillion-parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hoppers launched, and representing every major computer maker in the world.\nThis will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads, and data center environments in the first-year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices, or NIM. NIMs provide secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM, with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics, and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock, and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral, Snowflake, and Stability AI.\nNIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs, gaming revenue of $2.65 billion US dollars was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs market reception is strong, and end demand and channel inventory remain healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor Cores. Now, with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, and AI enthusiasts, and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs.\nTensorRT-LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3 mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models, as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. Top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent, and Ubisoft, are embracing NVIDIA Avatar character engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and non-playable characters. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $427 million US dollars was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year-on-year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications.\nSome of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including Ansys, Cadence, 3DEXCITE at Dassault Systèmes, Brand, and Siemens. Developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year. Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse-powered digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive, revenue was $329 million US dollars, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers, and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving.\nWe supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets. We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, with several leading EV makers, including BYD, Xpeng, GAC's Aion Hyper, and Neural. Drive Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. Okay, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4%, and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory charges. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs, and increased compute and infrastructure investments.\nIn Q1, we returned $7.8 billion US dollars to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares, with 10 June 2024 as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion US dollars, ±2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, ±50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion US dollars and $2.8 billion US dollars, respectively. Full-year OpEx is expected to grow in the low 40% range.\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $300 million US dollars, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IRA website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen, as he would like to make a few comments.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing, and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence.\nAI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services, and NVIDIA Cloud instances attract rental customers from a rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform propels our data center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video, and 3D, and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from foundation up, full-stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction.\nFrom today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan, and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do. From general-purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills. At the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multi-year buildout of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multi-billion dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI.\nThe combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, Spectrum-X switches, high-speed interconnects, and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer, more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs, through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.\n\nSimona Jankowski\n\nVP of Investor Relations, NVIDIA\n\nThank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comments that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore? What does it mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWe will be shipping, well, we've been in production for a little bit of time, but our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGot it. This year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWe will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I wanted to ask Jensen about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper, just given the system's nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center.\nDo these complexities sort of elongate the transition? How do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYep. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. The platform includes support for air-cooled, liquid-cooled, x86, and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X, and a very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC, that I showed at GTC. For some customers, they will ramp into their existing install base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. Of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nWe've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. The CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull ahead or hoarding behavior because of tight supply, competition, or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your very strong shipment growth?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. The reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now it's going to be multimodality, and Gemini, and Bitstamp, and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there.\nThere's also a long line of generative AI startups, some 15,000, 20,000 startups that in all different fields, from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design application, productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars. The list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing, actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible. I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data, to train their regional models. There's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. Anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high, and it outstrips our supply.\nLonger term, that's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. This is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past, but time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. The reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven only computer. It's an intention understanding computer. It understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do, and it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan and come back with a solution. Every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant, intelligent answers.\nThat's going to change computing stacks all over the world. You saw at Build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. This is just the beginning of all the things that people see today, the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs, and the things that we're doing with all the startups, large companies, and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Understanding what you just said about how strong demand is, you have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have, or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWe see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. We expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. The reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent do you consider them as competitors medium to long term? In your view, do you think they're limited to addressing mostly internal workloads, or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline, from unstructured data processing to prepare for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. As I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed. It's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. The generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. It's one of the reasons why TensorRT-LLM was so well received.\nWe improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture, and the richness of our software. One, you could use NVIDIA for everything from computer vision to image processing to computer graphics to all modalities of computing. As the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. Accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, it's how you're going to save energy in computing. The versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data centers. Second, we're in every cloud.\nFor developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. We're on-prem, we're in the cloud, we're in computers of any size and shape, we're practically everywhere. That's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. This is becoming more apparent to people, that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips, and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together.\nThe fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. Just to put it in perspective in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion US dollars infrastructure and you improve the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value to you is $5 billion US dollars. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. The value of it is really quite extraordinary. This is the reason why today performance matters everything.\nThis is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that go along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it. All of it adds up. The highest performance is also the lowest TCO.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at, the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting. I mean, 5x in training, some of the stuff you talked about at GTC, up to 30x in inference. It's an amazing thing to watch, but it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on is going to be not as competitive with your new stuff, very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycles of that product.\nI'd like you to, if you wouldn't mind, speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, they're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. It'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build-out, you're going to feel very differently. Because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. When Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. After Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. There's a short, we're on a one-year rhythm, as we explain to the world. We want our customers to see our roadmap for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways, so they had to just keep on building. There's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance average your way into it.\nThat's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today, and time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable. Why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable and getting this thing called time to train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI, and the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. The question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? That's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important.\nYou're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership for companies to trust the leadership, want to build on your platform, and know that the platform they're building on is going to get better and better. Leadership matters a great deal. Time to train matters a great deal. The difference between time to train that is three months earlier just to get it done. In order to get time to train on a three-month project, getting started three months earlier is everything. It's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. That's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is, how is it that we're moving so fast and advancing so quickly?\nWe have all the stats here. We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We actually also like our PowerPoint slides to look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. The reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. One of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructures here, then we disaggregate it and integrate it into our customers' data centers however they like. We know how it's going to perform, and we know where the bottlenecks are.\nWe know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep, intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. We understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. I appreciate it. Those are the three points.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Lipacis\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost compute cycle down. This was a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU, CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. If I mischaracterize that observation, please do let me know.\nThe question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. The question is, does the general-purpose computing framework become more at risk, or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general-purpose framework? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general-purpose. For example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet that was really designed for general-purpose computing. There's the control loop of an operating system code, probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose computing, not for accelerated computing. I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities. Maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel. They're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the runtime, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing.\nThe versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of startups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. Every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along, or the moment diffusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now. Now, all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory. Because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important.\nEach one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model, but to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software. That software is going to continue to evolve. That software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily a million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it, and we're ready for it. The versatility of our platform is really quite key.\nIf you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I actually got a curious—I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about—I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impacts, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin. I didn't hear the question. Something bleeped out. H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, we have customers that we honor, and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. It's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. Those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers and the markets there, and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market, and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell towards the end of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. Jensen, actually, more of a clarification on what you said GB200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs, and the systems business was relatively small. I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO, or is it something else, or is it just the architecture? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense, and we integrate them into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell, and that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even.\nYou're going to see liquid-cooled version, air-cooled version, x86 versions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed, and they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now, of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously. The integration of CPUs and the much more compressed density of computing, liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power, and not to mention to be more energy efficient. It's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center, and everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance networking from networking switches, networking, of course, NICs.\nWe have Ethernet now so that we can bring NVIDIA AI to large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Technology, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that when there were—while there were reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provided some real advantage that made that technology worth delivering to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper or Grace and Blackwell.\nCan you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side whereby, while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, some advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific, and we build excellent systems together. Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips—calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip.\nThe two of them are connected with this interface that's like a terabytes per second. It's off the charts. The memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory, so we save a lot of power on every single node. Finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next generation large language models for inferencing. You saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU, so we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. There are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons, and there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way.\nIf we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. Today, as you saw at the Build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next generation PCs, Copilot+PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. It also supports ARM beautifully, so it opens up opportunities for system innovation, even for PCs.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking, and amidst rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation ahead? Your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive. Kudos, sparsity, precision, grace, coherent connectivity.\nWhen you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? I guess maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA",
    "content2": "Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. We are on a one-year rhythm. You can also count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet, but we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting roadmap coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. For companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric. Ethernet's a network.\nInfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network. With Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. We're fully committed to all three links: NVLink computing fabric for a single computing domain, to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. We're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. You're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mountain of chips that are coming. The beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA, and all of it runs our entire software stack.\nIf you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster and faster. If you invest in our architecture today without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers, and everything just runs. I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. We should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens. We're going to do that at scale. Thank you.\nThat will conclude our question and answer session and our call for today.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nWe thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect."

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially, up 265% year on year, and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion, up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center, data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached a tipping point of a new computing era. The trillion-dollar installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing.\nAs Moore's law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO, and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose-built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the Q4, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially, and up 409% year on year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking.\nCompute revenue grew more than 5x, and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Q4 data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases, and regions.\nThe versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing, and a broad range of CUDA-accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale.\nEnterprises access NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU-specialized, and private clouds, or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy. In the Q4, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers.\nMicrosoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year on year. Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 Enterprise Suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services, and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems.\nThese AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation, and click-through rates. Meta, in its latest quarter, cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers, and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions, and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains.\nEarly customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP, and Snowflake. The field of foundation large language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthroughs in generative AI.\nExciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.AI, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity, and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures, and customs of the world's many regions. Others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries, like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generative Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU-specialized cloud providers.\nJust this morning, we announced that we collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the-art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, data center, and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains, such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low-latency machine learning for fraud detection, or robotics, leveraging our full-stack accelerated computing platform.\nWe estimate that data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA Drive Infrastructure Solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, curation, labeling, and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi, and tier-one suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. In effect, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA.\nAs AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging, and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara Healthcare Platform and NVIDIA BioNemo, a generative AI service to develop, customize, and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery.\nBioNemo features a growing collection of pre-trained biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for the proprietary AI model through BioNemo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases, from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography, growth was strong across all regions except for China, where our data center revenue declined significantly following the US government export control regulations imposed in October.\nAlthough we have not received licenses from the US government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that do not require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single-digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4, and we expect it to stay in a similar range in the Q1. In regions outside of the US and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language, on domestic data, and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture, along with InfiniBand networking.\nTogether, they have emerged as the de facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the Q2. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI dedicated infrastructures.\nWe are now entering the Ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over Ethernet that are purpose-built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum Switch, BlueField, DPU, and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide.\nWe are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter. We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development, as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, which was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year.\nBetter than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor Cores in the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI TOPS, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating, and everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI.\nWith our DLSS technologies, 7 out of 8 pixels can be AI-generated, resulting in up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. With the TensorRT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large language models, generative AI can run up to 5x faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 series AI laptops from every major OEM. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14-inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 TOPS of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms.\nAt CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine Microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools, and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workflows. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed base, and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.\nMoving to ProVisualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX ADA architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive, and robotics.\nThe automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitalize workflows from design to build, simulate, operate, and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers, including Brooklyn, WPP, and ZeroLight, are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like Lotus are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism, and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially, and down 4% year on year.\nFiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA Drive platform by automakers. NVIDIA Drive O-RAN is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA Drive Thor, designed for vision transformers, offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring, and AI cockpit functionality, and will be available next year.\nThere were several automotive customer announcements this quarter. LiAuto, Great Wall Motor, Zeekr, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely, and Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76%, and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7%, on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments, and employee growth.\nIn Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year 2024, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, ±2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and ProViz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77%, respectively, ±50 basis points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs.\nBeyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items.\nFurther financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on 4 March 2024, and the TD Cowen 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston on 5 March 2024. Of course, please join us for our annual GTC Conference starting Monday, 18 March 2024, in San Jose, California.\nTo be held in person for the first time in five years, GTC will kick off with Jensen's keynote, and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, 19 March. We are now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, thank you so much for taking the question, and congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jensen on the data center business. Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar 2024 and 2025 have evolved over the past 90 days. As you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within data center, things like software, sovereign AI. I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium to long term. Recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that? If so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Toshiya. Let's see. There were three questions. One more time. The first question was, can you? AI.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nWell, I guess your expectations for data center, how they've evolved. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nOkay. Yeah. Well, you know we guide one quarter at a time, but fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth, calendar 2024 to calendar 2025, and beyond. Let me tell you why. We're at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions, and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. You could tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from four to six years.\nThere's just no reason to update with more CPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. You have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. With accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20 to 1. Huge numbers. Of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. Generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty about it during the call. Remember, generative AI is a new application.\nIt is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it. The third is it is enabling a whole new industry. This is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at. It connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time, a data center is not just about computing data, storing data, and serving the employees of a company. We now have a new type of data center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory.\nYou've heard me describe it as AI factories. Basically, it takes raw material, which is data, transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA builds, and turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT, Midjourney, or Search these days, are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible startups in digital biology generating proteins and generating chemicals, and the list goes on. All of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of data center.\nThis data center, we call AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. We're seeing diversity. One of the other reasons, so the foundation is that. The way it manifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single time you interact with ChatGPT, you know that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see these amazing Sora videos that are being generated, or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA is doing inferencing.\nThe inference part of our business has grown tremendously. We estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing because these models are getting larger and larger. The amount of inference is increasing. We're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You could see from their CapEx and their discussions. There's a whole new category called GPU-specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU-specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI. ServiceNow is just a really, really great example.\nYou see Adobe. You see others, SAP and others. You see consumer internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI, so they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now, our industries represent multi-billion dollar businesses. Auto, health, financial services in total are vertical industries, are multi-billion dollar businesses now. Of course, sovereign AI.\nThe reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, and the culture of each region are different. They own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own digital intelligence, and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them. Each one of the regions around the world, the data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. They want to protect the data. They want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation into AI, and provision those services themselves.\nWe're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, and so many other regions. My expectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West, will surely be replicated around the world. These AI generation factories are going to be in every industry, every company, every region. I think this last year, we've seen generative AI really becoming a whole new application space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed. That's driving our growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. That's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of where that number was maybe the year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? How are you measuring that? I assume it's, in some cases, the same GPUs you use for training and inference. How solid is that measurement? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nI'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated. We estimated it. Let me tell you why. A year ago, the recommender systems that people are when you run the internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because, as you know, the internet has trillions of I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there. Your phone is three inches square. The ability for them to fit all of that information down to something such as small real estate is through an amazing system called recommender systems. These recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches.\nThe recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings. It needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search. It needs GPU accelerating for re-ranking. It needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. As you know, recommender system is the single largest software engine on the planet. Almost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems.\nWhenever you use ChatGPT as being inference, whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe, these are all generative models. The list goes on. None of these, as I mentioned, existed a year ago. 100% new.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys.Thanks for taking my question. Colette, I wanted to touch on your comment that you expected the next generation of products. I assume that meant Blackwell to be supply constrained. Can you dig into that a little bit? What is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing up? How long do you expect that to be constrained? Do you expect the next generation to be constrained all the way through calendar 2025? When do those start to ease?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. The first thing is, overall, our supply is improving. Overall, our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us. Everything from, of course, the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators, to transceivers, networking, cables, and you name it. The list of components that we ship, as you know, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip, but the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 lbs. These things are really complicated things. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason. If you ever look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system is mind-boggling.\nIt is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world's ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year over year. The supply chain is really doing fantastic supporting us. Overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides through the year. We'll do our best. The cycle times are improving. We're going to continue to do our best. However, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from zero to a very large number. You can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up.\nWhenever we have a new generation of products, and right now we are ramping H200s, there's no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand new product into the world of Ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for AI dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X, Ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system. With Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of Ethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation, or traffic isolation, so that we can optimize Ethernet for AI.\nInfiniBand will be our AI dedicated infrastructure. Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking. That is ramping. With all new products, demand is greater than supply. That's just kind of the nature of new products. We work as fast as we can to catch up with the demand. Overall, net-net, our supply is increasing very nicely.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGood afternoon, Jensen, Colette. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask, I guess, a two-part question. It comes at what Stacy was just getting at on your demand being significantly more than your supply, even though the supply is improving. I guess the two sides of the question are, first for Colette, how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of build-up of product that might not yet be turned on?\nThen, Jensen, for you, I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about the thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries, to smaller startup companies, to things in the healthcare arena, to governments. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling. I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about fairly allocating, sort of for the good of your company, but also for the good of the industry. Thanks.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nLet me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with, have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud, as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers, but also what they need internally. They are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need.\nOur discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture, but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest, and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. It's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built, and what is in use for end customers. The relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the builds has really helped us with that allocation, and both helped us with our communications with them.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nFirst, our CSPs have a very clear view of our product roadmap and transitions. That transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place, and where, and when. They know the timing to the best of our ability, and they know quantities, and of course, allocation. We allocate fairly. Do the best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. As you mentioned earlier, why allocate something when a data center is not ready? Nothing is more difficult than to have anything sit around. Allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily.\nWhere we do, the question that you asked about the end markets, you know that we have an excellent ecosystem with OEMs, ODMs, CSPs, and, very importantly, end markets. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs, and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the healthcare companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies. There's just a giant suite of robotics companies that are emerging.\nThe warehouse robotics to surgical robotics to humanoid robotics, all kinds of really interesting robotics companies, agriculture robotics companies. All of these startups, large companies, healthcare, financial services, auto, and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. Oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. This ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant. At the core of it, we want to allocate fairly, avoiding waste, and look for opportunities to connect partners and end users. We're looking for those opportunities all the time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments, but if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to make as much of a financial commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower, or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order book and your backlog things?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Let me highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand, given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules that we've looked for. The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, components that we need for manufacturing, but also often we are procuring capacity that we may need. The lengths of that need for capacity or the length for the components are all different.\nSome of them may be for the next two quarters, some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are pre-designed to make sure that we have the reserved capacity that we need at several of our manufacturing suppliers as we work forward. Would it read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply? All of them just have different lengths as we have sometimes had to buy things in long lead times or things that needed capacity to be built for us.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks. Congratulations on the results. Colette, I wanted to talk about your comment regarding gross margins and that they should go back to the mid-70s. If you do not mind unpacking that. Also, is that due to the HBM content in the new products? What do you think are the drivers of that comment? Thanks so much.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. We highlighted in our opening remarks really about our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1. Both of those quarters are unique. Those two quarters are unique in their gross margin as they include some benefits from favorable component costs in the supply chain, kind of across both our compute and networking, and also in several different stages of our manufacturing process. Looking forward, we have visibility into a mid-70s gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year, taking us back to where we were before this Q4 and Q1 peak that we've had here. We're really looking at just a balance of our mix.\nMix is always going to be our largest driver of what we will be shipping for the rest of the year. Those are really just the drivers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I took a picture of the question for you, Jensen. When you think about the million x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nHey, CJ Thanks for the question. Yeah, that's the really cool part. If you look at the reason why we're able to improve performance so much, it's because we have two characteristics about our platform. One is that it's accelerated, and two, it's programmable. It's not brittle.\nNVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally the very beginning when CNNs and Alex Krushevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Jeff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through RNNs to LSTMs to RLs to deep learning RLs to transformers to every single version, every single version, and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers, every single, and now time sequence stuff, and every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along. We've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it, and deploy it into our installed base. This is really the great, amazing part.\nOn the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor Cores, like our transformer engine for Tensor Cores, improve new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor Cores, meanwhile supporting the installed base at the same time. As a result, we take all of our new software algorithm inventions, all of the new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed base on the one hand. On the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary, like transformers, we can create something brand new like the Hopper transformer engine and implement it into future.\nWe simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it better and better and better, so our customers' installed base is enriched over time with our new software. On the other hand, for new technologies, create revolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden, amazing breakthroughs in large language models were made possible. Those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. We carry everybody with us on the one hand. We make giant breakthroughs on the other hand.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in the prepared comments, you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also pointed out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a single-digit percent of your total data center business. I guess the question is, what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market? Why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that opportunity again? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you. At the core, remember, the US government wants to limit the latest capabilities of NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI to the Chinese market. The US government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars, if you will, are the restrictions. We had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused so that we understood what the restrictions are, reconfigured our products in a way that is not software hackable in any way. That took some time. We reset our product offering to China\n. Now we're sampling to customers in China, and we're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in that marketplace within the specifications of the restriction. That's it. This last quarter, our business significantly declined as we paused in the marketplace. We stopped shipping in the marketplace. We expect this quarter to be about the same. After that, hopefully, we can go compete for our business and do our best. We'll see how it turns out.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Elena of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. Hey, Jensen, Colette, and NVIDIA team. First of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk a little bit about your software business, and it's pleasing to hear that it's over a billion dollars. I was hoping, Jensen or Colette, if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business. In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nLet me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. First, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams. We work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. Whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them. Their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams. We enhance, we fix, we maintain, we patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing.\nAs you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain, from data processing, SQL versus SQL structured data, versus all the images and text and PDF, which is unstructured, to classical machine learning, to computer vision, to speech, to large language models, all recommender systems. All of these things require different software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries. If you don't have software, you can't open new markets.\nIf you don't have software, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. Now people understand that the software is really key. In the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams.\nHowever, now that generative AI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing, and when it is now essential to embrace accelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow, to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing, all of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all of the world's clouds, private clouds, and on-prem.\nWe are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed base optimization for all of their software stacks. We containerize them into our stack. We call it NVIDIA AI Enterprise. The way we go to market with it is think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a runtime like an operating system. It's an operating system for artificial intelligence. We charge $4,500 per GPU per year. My guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds, private clouds, and on-prem will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, obviously for our GPUs.\nThis is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. Colette mentioned that it's already at a billion-dollar run rate. We're really just getting started.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang, CEO, for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe computer industry is making two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand with increasing throughput, while managing cost and energy. The incredible speedup of NVIDIA enabled a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where software can learn, understand, and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world.\nWe are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this industrial revolution. Every company in every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence. In the future, their proprietary generative AI. Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories.\nWe believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world's data center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions. This new AI infrastructure will open up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer internet companies. Now every industry is on board, from automotive to healthcare to financial services to industrial to telecom, media, and entertainment.\nNVIDIA's full-stack computing platform with industry-specific applications, frameworks, and a huge developer and partner ecosystem gives us the speed, scale, and reach to help every company, to help companies in every industry become an AI company. We have so much to share with you at next month's GTC in San Jose. Be sure to join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially, up more than 200% year-on-year, and well above our outlook of $16 billion. Starting with data center, the continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow, and Zoom AI Companion. Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year, and networking revenue nearly tripled.\nInvestment in infrastructure for training and inferencing, large language models, deep learning recommender systems, and generative AI applications is fueling strong, broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our data center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. Broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla and autonomous driving.\nCloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our data center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs, as well as from a broadening set of GPU specialized CSPs globally, that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud, with instances in high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand, and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Toward the end of the quarter, the US government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East.\nThese regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products, including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series, and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of data center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter, though we believe they'll be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The US government designed the regulation to allow the US industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promote US technology leadership, spurs economic growth, and supports US jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process.\nFor products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer compliant solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the US government does not wish to have advanced notice before each shipment. We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the US government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems.\nFor example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies, including Infosys, Reliance, and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. French private cloud provider Scaleway is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100s, InfiniBand, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative, and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture, with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry-standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of customers.\nThis was also the first revenue quarter of our GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU specialized cloud providers, and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers. Initial shipments to Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre took place in the third quarter. The UK government announced it will build one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers called Isambard-AI, with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center Jülich also announced that it will build its next generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance.\nAll in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the US, Europe, and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops, with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommenders, chatbots, copilots, and text-to-image generation. This is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility, and thus the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, we now achieve more than 2x the inference performance or half the cost of inferencing LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3E, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs.\nIt boosts inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Llama 2. Combined TensorRT-LLM and H200 increase performance or reduce cost by 4x in just one year without customers changing their stack. This is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the A100, H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models, and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stack. We introduced an AI Foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure.\nCustomers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data, and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stack in our DGX Cloud, all with enterprise-grade security and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI Foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top-performing and most versatile platform for AI training, and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs, or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on a nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments.\nNetworking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week, highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000mi of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X and N Ethernet offering, with technologies purpose-built for AI, will be available in Q1 next year, with support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional Ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption.\nWe are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software support and services offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX Cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. Each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively. Our latest DGX Cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Genentech. The biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnerships with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty Images, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and others to come. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year.\nWith strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season, with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technologies now available at price points as low as $299, we enter the holidays with the best-ever lineup for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels, even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS. The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrades and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high-performance PCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs define the most performant AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT-LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x.\nWith an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce Now cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and Starfield. Moving to Proviz, revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially, and up 108% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering, and simulation use cases, and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in healthcare, and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX SmartNIC, offering up to 2x the AI processing, ray tracing, and graphics performance of the previous generations.\nThese powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine-tuning AI models, training smaller models, and running inference locally. We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building, and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse-powered digital twins to plan, design, build, and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. Axon is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced two new Omniverse Cloud services for automotive digital utilization available on Microsoft Azure: a virtual factory simulation engine, and autonomous vehicle simulation engine.\nMoving to automotive, revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially, and up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA Drive Orin SoCs and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership with Foxconn to include NVIDIA Drive Thor, our next-generation automotive SoC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-the-art, safe, and secure software-defined car. Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74%, and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher data center sales and lower net inventory reserves, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products.\nSequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, ±2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by data center, with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments.\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial information is included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on 28 November, the Wells Fargo QMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on 29 November, the Arete Virtual Techs Conference on 7 December, and the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on 8 January. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, 21 February 2024. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please hold for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press Star and the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Just, Colette, wanted to clarify what China contributions are you expecting in Q4. Then, Jensen, the main question is for you. Where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market? Because when I just looked at the trajectory of your data center, its growth, it will be close to nearly 30% of all the spending in data center next year.\nWhat metrics are you keeping an eye on to inform you that you can continue to grow? Just where are we in the adoption curve of your products into the generative AI market? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nFirst, let me start with your question back on export controls and the impact that we are seeing in our Q4 outlook and guidance that we provided. We had seen historically, over the last several quarters, that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our data center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term.\nWe are, though, working to expand our data center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation-compliant solutions that do not require a license. These products may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nGenerative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval-based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has been augmented now, added with a generative method, and it's changed almost everything. You could see that text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-3D, text-to-protein, text-to-chemicals. These were things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data is changed.\nIt used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. We're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP, Dropbox, and many others that you're going to hear about. One of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about a trillion dollars or so, has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. Now there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants. Instead of manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. Instead of licensing software, we'll continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use the software.\nWe'll connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams of AIs, which is going to be the modern version of software, the modern version of enterprise business software. The transformation of software and the way that software is done is driving the hardware underneath. You could see that it's transforming hardware in two ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There are two trends. One is related to accelerated computing. General purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. Now that we have much, much better approaches called accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you could save an order of magnitude of time, or you could save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. Accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general purpose computing into this new approach.\nThat's been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about, where we represent about 1/3 of that. There's a new class of data centers. This new class of data centers is unlike the data centers of the past, where you have a lot of applications running, used by a great many people, that are different tenants using the same infrastructure. That data center stores a lot of files. These new data centers have very few applications, if not one application, used by basically one tenant. It processes data, it trains models, and it generates tokens. It generates AI. We call these new data centers AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere in just about every country.\nIf you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with large language model startups, generative AI startups, and consumer internet companies. We're in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's being ramped, you see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots, copilots, and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms. You're seeing GPU-specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they're dedicated to doing really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people, countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data, and develop their own AI. You see that in India.\nAbout a year ago in Sweden, you're seeing in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France. The number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. My guess is that almost every major region will have, and surely every major country will have, their own AI clouds. I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. We're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nTechnology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business.\nGiven the growth rates that you've now cited, I think it's 155% year-over-year, and strong growth sequentially, it looks like that business is almost approaching a $2.5 to 3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet evolving, and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum-X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above, and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Our networking business is already at a $10 billion+ run rate, and it's going to get much larger. As you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories are standardized on InfiniBand.\nThe reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI in a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. With InfiniBand and with software-defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation, and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate, the low latency, and the very low overhead of InfiniBand that's a natural part of InfiniBand. InfiniBand is not so much just a network. It's also a computing fabric. We put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We'll do floating-point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself.\nThat's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand or InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. The difference is profound. The reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up, is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. If you were renting that infrastructure over the course of four or five years, it really, really adds up. InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise, this is enterprise computing where we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AIs. We're building custom AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills.\nFor example, recently we spoke about one of the models that we're creating. It's called ChipNeMo. We're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company. Our company is, for all of our employees, doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories we use to train the models. We would like the AI to be able to run in an Ethernet environment. What we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet. It doesn't replace Ethernet. It's 100% compliant with Ethernet, and it's optimized for east-west traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with BlueField, as well as our Spectrum switch, that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all, but some.\nWe achieve excellent results. The way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. HP, Dell, and Lenovo have the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stack. Now they integrate with BlueField as well as bundle, take to market their Spectrum switch. They'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force, vast network of resellers, and a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized, at least, end-to-end AI solution. That's basically it, bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\nI wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander, and what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Grace Hopper is in production in high-volume production now. We're expecting next year, just with all of the design window we have in high-performance computing and AI infrastructures, we are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multi-billion dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us. The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create computing nodes that simultaneously have very fast memory, as well as very large memory.\nIn the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called RAG, retrieval augmented generation, you could have a generative AI model be able to refer to proprietary data or factual data before it generates a response. That data is quite large. You could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically stored an entire book into its system memory before you ask it questions, and the context length can be quite large. This way, the generative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand. On the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data, or domain-specific data, your data, and be contextually relevant and reduce hallucination. That particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper.\nIt also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU than x86. Maybe it's European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and like to build up a whole stack, or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot to ARM because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are a variety of different reasons that drive the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to just an extraordinary start. This is a homegrown product.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTim Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about the visibility that you have on revenue. I know there's a few moving parts. I guess on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again.\nOn the other hand, China bans would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. I know we're not even into 2024 yet, and it doesn't sound like, Jensen, you think that next year would be a peak in your data center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that data center can grow even into 2025? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nAbsolutely believe that data center can grow through 2025. There, of course, are several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already one of the broadest, largest, and most capable supply chains in the world. Remember, people think that the GPU is a chip, but the HGX H100, the Hopper HGX, has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70lbs. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not.\nIt has even its passive components are incredible: high-voltage parts, high-frequency parts, high-current parts. It is a supercomputer, therefore, the only way to test a supercomputer is with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated. The testing of it is complicated. The shipping of it is complicated, and installation is complicated. Every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. The remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out that supply chain incredibly. Not to mention, all of our HGXs are connected with NVIDIA networking. The networking, the transceivers, the NICs, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. First of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world-class. Meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. We have new supply.\nWe have new customers, as I was mentioning earlier. Different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds, sovereign AI clouds coming up from all over the world as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them. They have to, they should, they have the skills. Surely with us, in combination, we can help them do that, build up their national AI. The first thing that they have to do is create their AI cloud, national AI cloud. You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has two paths. One path, or if I could say three paths. The first path, of course, is just off-the-shelf AI. There are, of course, ChatGPT, the fabulous off-the-shelf AI. There'll be others.\nThere's also proprietary AI because these software companies like ServiceNow, SAP, and there are many, many others that can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. They are about building tools, and on top of their tools, they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can then rent to their customer base. They're sitting on a gold mine. Almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on a gold mine, and they recognize that. They have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI Foundry where we leverage NVIDIA's capabilities to be able to serve them in that. The next one is enterprises building their own custom AIs, their own custom chatbots, their own custom RAGs. This capability is spreading all over the world.\nThe way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking, and our switches, running our software stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, taking it through our market partners, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, so on and so forth. We're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the startups and CSPs, moving to consumer internet companies, moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. Ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse come together, and that is really, really exciting work. I think we're at the beginning of a basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing.\nThis is going to affect every company, every industry, every country.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you. I wanted to clarify something with Colette real quick, and then I had a question for Jensen as well. Colette, you mentioned that you'll be introducing regulation-compliant products over the next couple of months, yet the contribution to Q4 revenue should be relatively limited. Is that a timing issue? Could it be a source of re-acceleration and growth for data center in April and beyond? Are the price points such that the contribution to revenue going forward should be relatively limited? The question for Jensen, the AI Foundry service announcement from last week, I just wanted to ask about that and hopefully have you expand on it. How is the monetization model going to work?\nIs it primarily services and software revenue? How should we think about the long-term opportunity set? Is this going to be exclusive to Microsoft, or do you have plans to expand to other partners as well? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nOkay. Thanks, Toshiya, on the question regarding potentially new products that we could provide to our China customers. It's a significant process to both design and develop these new products. As we discussed, we're going to make sure that we are in full discussions with the US government of our intent in these products as well. Given our state about where we are in the quarter, we're already several weeks into the quarter. That's just going to take some time for us to go through and discuss with our customers their needs and desires of these new products that we have.\nMoving forward, whether that's medium term or long term, it's just hard to say. Both the ideas of what we can produce with the US government and what the interest of our China customers is. We stay still focused on finding that right balance for our China customers, but it's hard to say at this time.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nToshiya, thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI Foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company, our data, our domain expertise. In the case of many companies, we create tools, and most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms. Those tools are used by people today, and in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire.\nThese AI platforms just got to go across the world, and you'll see. We've already announced a few: SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others are coming. The reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and hand out their data and hand out their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. They come to us. We have several things that are really essential in a foundry. Just as TSMC is a foundry, you have to have AI technology. As you know, we have just an incredible depth of AI capability, AI technology capability.\nYou have to have the best practice, known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrailed, fine-tuned, so on and so forth, that are safe, so on and so forth. The third thing is you need factories. That's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI Foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD system for creating AIs, are called NeMo. They run on NVIDIA's factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that with each one of our partners, they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud where we work together. They bring their data. They bring their domain expertise. We bring our researchers and engineers. We help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible. Then that custom AI becomes theirs.\nThey deploy it on a runtime that is enterprise-grade, enterprise-optimized, or performance-optimized, runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud, on-prem, anywhere. It's secure, securely patched, constantly patched, and optimized and supported. We call that NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GPU per year. That's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then, with that basic license, can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways, we're wholesale. They become retail. They could have a subscription license base. They could have a per instance, or they could do per usage. There's a lot of different ways that they could take to create their own business model. Ours is basically like a software license, like an operating system.\nOur business model is help you create your custom models. You run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. It's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I wanted to know if it weren't for the China restrictions, would the Q4 guide have been higher, or are you supply constrained in just reshipping stuff that would have gone to China elsewhere? I guess along those lines, if you could give us a feeling for where your lead times are right now in data center and just the China redirection such as this, is it lowering those lead times because you've got parts that are sort of immediately available to ship?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Stacy, let me see if I can help you understand. Yes, there are still situations where we are working on both improving our supply each and every quarter. We've done a really solid job of ramping every quarter, which has defined our revenue. With the absence of China for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply constrained that we could have sold to China, but we no longer can. Could our guidance have been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply and plan on continuing growing all throughout next year as well to work on that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Congrats, everybody, on the results. Jensen, I had a two-part question for you.\nIt comes off of sort of one premise. The premise is I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and that somehow as inference, even large model inference, takes more and more of the TAM, the market will become more competitive, you'll be less differentiated, etc., etc. I guess the two parts of the question are, number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLMs and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. Second, up until a month or two ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workload, the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference.\nI think that's a large part of the workload now. Maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nSure. Inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. We this quarter announced one of the most exciting new engines optimizing compilers called TensorRT-LLM. The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub, it's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars, integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world almost instantaneously. There are several reasons for that, obviously. We could create TensorRT-LLM because CUDA is programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT-LLM on the same GPU, without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two.\nThe pace of our innovation is so high, H200 increases it by another factor of two. Our inference performance, another way of saying inference cost, just reduced by a factor of four within about a year's time. That's really, really hard to keep up with. The reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because of our installed base. We've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20+ years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's available from every enterprise system maker. It's used by companies of just about every industry. Anytime you see an NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible. It's something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it.\nWe make it our, if you will, architecture compatibility is job one. That has conveyed to the world the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first, and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All of the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs. We have such a large installed base, large millions and millions of GPUs in the cloud, 100 million GPUs from people's PCs, just about every workstation in the world. They're all architecturally compatible. If you're an inference platform and you are deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider. As a software application provider, you're looking for a large installed base. Data processing.\nBefore you could train a model, you have to curate the data. You have to dedupe the data. Maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. You have to process the data, clean the data, align the data, normalize the data. All of that data is measured not in bytes and megabytes, it's measured in terabytes and petabytes. The amount of data processing that you do before data engineering, before that you do training, is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do in ultimately creating a data-driven machine learning service. Data processing is just a massive part. We accelerate Spark, we accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did is called CUDF Pandas.\nWithout one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world, Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA. Just out of the box, without a line of code. The acceleration is really quite terrific. People are just incredibly excited about it. Pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, really, data processing for data science. NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the history of the tech industry, right, those companies that have been successful have always been focused on ecosystem silicon, hardware, software, strong partnerships, and, just as importantly, right, an aggressive cadence of new products, more segmentation over time.\nThe team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence in data center from two years to now every year, with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization, inferencing, CPU, GPU, DPU networking. How do we think about your R&D, OpEx growth outlook to support a more aggressive and expanding forward roadmap? More importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA",
    "content2": "Gosh, boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan, and you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. The reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT-LLM and H200 reduced the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four.\nThat includes, of course, our speeds and fees, but mostly it's because of our software, mostly the software benefits because of the architecture. We want to accelerate our roadmap for that reason. The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI. The world's number of data center configurations, this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider, and not one of their networking control plane security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different. Yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers, and we work incredibly well with all of them. Not to mention, we then take the whole thing and we create AI factories that are standalone.\nWe take our platform, we can put them into supercomputers, we can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise, bringing generative AI to enterprise, is something nobody's ever done before. We're right now in the process of going to market with all of that. The complexity includes, of course, all of the technologies, segments, and the pace. It includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. It includes all of the domain-specific libraries that we create. The reason why every computer company, without thinking, can integrate NVIDIA into their roadmap and take it to market is because there's market demand for it. There's market demand in healthcare, manufacturing, AI, financial services, supercomputing, and quantum computing.\nThe list of markets and segments that we have domain-specific libraries is incredibly broad. Finally, we have an end-to-end solution for data centers: InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, just about every permutation combination of technology solutions and software stacks provided. That translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers, the largest ecosystem of system makers, the largest and broadest distribution partnership network, and ultimately the greatest reach. Surely that takes a lot of energy. The thing that really holds it together, and this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When we develop a domain-specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimized it for enterprise.\nWhen we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature, or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. That discipline, that architecture-compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now, is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nOur strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI. Large language model startups, consumer internet companies, and global cloud service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand.\nEnterprise software companies like Adobe, Dropbox, SAP, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. Enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity. The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center, an AI factory optimized for refining data, training and inference, and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment, expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI industrial revolution. NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack define an AI factory today.\nAs we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted three elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride: CPU, networking, and software and services. Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line next year. Irrespective of the CPU choice, we can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew fivefold year-over-year and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories. Enterprises are also racing to adopt AI. Ethernet is the standard networking. This week, we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X is an end-to-end solution of BlueField SuperNIC, Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch, and software that boosts Ethernet performance by up to 1.6x for AI workloads. Dell, HPE, and Lenovo have joined us to bring a full generative AI solution of NVIDIA AI computing, networking, and software to the world's enterprises. NVIDIA Software and Services is on track to exit the year at an annualized run rate of $1 billion. Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow and SAP need to build and operate proprietary AI. Enterprises need to build and deploy custom AI copilots. We have the AI technology, expertise, and scale to help customers build custom models with their proprietary data on NVIDIA DGX Cloud and deploy the AI applications on enterprise-grade NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA is essentially an AI foundry.\nNVIDIA's GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year, and above our outlook of $11 billion. Let me first start with data center. Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year. Data center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies for our HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models. Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud, as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers, are deploying in volume HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs. Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI. There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms.\nOur supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. Our data center supply chain, including HGX, with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking, has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process, such as CoWoS packaging. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the US, as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25 of our data center revenue, including compute and networking solutions. At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results.\nGiven the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets. Our cloud service providers drove exceptionally strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI. The NVIDIA HGX platform is the culmination of nearly two decades of full-stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software, and algorithms.\nInstances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure, and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. Consumer internet companies also drove the very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA-powered instances in the cloud, as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure. Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem, through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, with access to our acceleration libraries, retained models, and APIs.\nWe announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated paths to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake data cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbots, search, and summarization, right from the Snowflake data cloud. Virtually every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI copilots, such as those just announced by Microsoft, can boost the productivity of over a billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers. Millions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support, and education will be able to leverage AI systems trained in their field. AI copilots and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers.\nWe are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media, and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design. Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enable users to create 3D scene backgrounds with the help of generative AI. We partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast-tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities.\nAI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA accelerated computing, and with Accenture consulting and deployment services. We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA DGX Cloud. Just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA, with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware. VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI, and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbots, assistance, search, and summarization.\nWe also announced new NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry-standard data center server ecosystem, and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor. L40S is not limited by CoWoS supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers. L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high-volume data center scaling out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inferencing, 3D design and visualization, video processing, and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial visualization. NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers are fully optimized for VMware Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HPE, and Lenovo. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU, entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers.\nIt is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre. NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second-generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3E memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024. We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language models, recommendator systems, and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA NVLink Switch System, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs over NVLink. DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year. Google Cloud, Meta, and Microsoft among the first to gain access.\nStrong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI. For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of millions and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners. For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success.\nIt is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer internet companies. Now moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktops. End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us. Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX, and about 20% have a GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance. Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs. NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs in several regions around the world.\nThis is likely to shift the seasonality of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops. In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continued to expand. Thirty-five new games added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur's Gate III. There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps. We are bringing generative AI to games. At Computex, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine for ACE, for games, a custom AI model foundry service. Developers can use the service to bring intelligence to non-player characters. It harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva, and Audio2Face.\nNow moving to professional visualization. Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year. The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations, with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to four NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 GB of GPU memory. They can be configured with NVIDIA AI Enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation, the NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500, and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput, and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation.\nIn addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development, and data science are expanding the opportunity in pro visualization for our RTX technology. One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote at SIGGRAPH earlier this month was the convergence of graphics and AI. This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for 2D in effect. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar, and NVIDIA formed the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse Cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD, to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workloads. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially, and up 15% year-on-year.\nSolid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on the NVIDIA DRIVE, O-RAN, SoC, with a number of new energy vehicle makers. The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA GPU chiplets. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments, from luxury to entry level. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1%, and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher data center sales. Our data center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margins. Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits.\nWe returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our board of directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2. That means turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our data center platform for AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads, from cloud to enterprise. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, ±2%.\nWe expect sequential growth to be driven largely by data center, with gaming and ProViz also contributing. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community.\nWe will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on 30 August in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Tech Conference on 5 September in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on 6 September, as well as the Citi Tech Conference on 7 September, both in New York, and the B of A Virtual AI Conference on 11 September. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, 21 November 2024. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Could you please pull up a question for us? Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of large model inference. I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have very much a lockdown share of the training market. A lot of the smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. With many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super duper quickly on large model inference. I think your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that. Could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference, and how your product portfolio is positioned for that? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks a lot. Let's take a quick step back. These large language models are pretty phenomenal. It does several things, of course. It has the ability to understand unstructured language. At its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language. It has encoded, or within it, compressed within it, a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it studied. What happens is you create these large language models, and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teacher-student models. It's a process called distillation.\nWhen you see these smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, just as you have professors, teachers, students, and so on and so forth. You're going to see this going forward. You start from a very large model, and it has a large amount of generality, generalization, and what's called zero-shot capability. For a lot of applications, questions, or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models miraculously have the capability to perform them. That's what makes it so magical. On the other hand, you would like to have these capabilities in all kinds of computing devices. What you do is you distill them down.\nThese smaller models might have excellent capabilities in a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well. They don't have what is called as good zero-shot capabilities. They all have their own unique capabilities, but you start from very large models.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, next we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. Just had a quick clarification on a question. Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year? You think it's up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%? Just any sense of how much supply, because you said it's growing every quarter. Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that pie is not really growing that much. What is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more off that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years. If I take your implied Q3 outlook of data center, $12 to 13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? Just give us some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Vivek, for the question regarding our supply. Yes, we do expect to continue increasing, ramping our supply over the next quarters, as well as into next fiscal year. In terms of percent, that's not something that we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building and HGX and many of our other new products that are coming to market. We are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers, and the long time that we have spent with them improving this supply.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers installed in the cloud, enterprise, and otherwise. That trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. The reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy-effective, and the most performant way of doing computing now.\nWhat you're seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated computing, generative AI came along. This incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition, to do a platform shift from general-purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing. There's about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers, call it a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spend each year. You're seeing that data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing, and generative AI. I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition. We're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line's open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me how much of data center in the quarter, maybe even the guide, is systems versus GPU, DGX versus just the H100. What I'm really trying to get at is how much is pricing or content, however you want to define that, versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nSure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our data center, as well as our data center growth that we had seen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture, but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling both of these architectures for the market. Now, when you think about that, what does that mean?\nFrom both the systems as a unit, of course, it is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms of the revenue increases. Both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside data center. Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. Those are a great opportunity for enterprise customers, and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer internet companies. Now, the importance of there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs. That's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about, the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. Again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nStacy, if I could just add something. You say it's H100, and I know you know what your mental image in your mind, but the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly a trillion transistors in combination. It takes a robot to build, well, many robots to build, because it's 70 pounds to lift. It takes a supercomputer to test the supercomputer. These things are technology marvels. The manufacturing of them is really intensive. I think we call it H100 as if it's a chip that comes off of a fab. H100s go out really as HGX and Centennial World's hyperscalers. They're really quite large system components, if you will.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Lipacis\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the success. Jensen, it seems like a key part of your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. I had a two-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements, and is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension, like how many person-years you've invested in building it? Part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on what percentage of the value of the NVIDIA platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, Mark, I really appreciate the question. Let me see if I could use some metrics. We have a runtime called NVIDIA AI Enterprise. This is one part of our software stack. This is, if you will, the runtime that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning, from data processing, the training of any model that you like to do on any framework you like to do, the inference, and the deployment, the scaling it out into a data center. It could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center. It could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware. You could do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field, and millions of GPUs in the cloud, in just about every single cloud. It runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multi-node. It also has multiple sessions or multiple computing instances per GPU.\nFrom multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes to entire data center scale, this runtime called NVIDIA AI Enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries, and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other. That runtime is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our install base, for our stack. That's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work. The number of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane. It's taken us two decades to get here. What I would characterize as probably the elements of our company, if you will, are several. I would say number one is architecture.\nThe flexibility, the versatility, and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, from data processing to training to inference, from pre-processing of the data before you do the inference to the post-processing of the data, tokenizing of languages so that you could then train with it. The workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. Anyways, that's where people focus, and it's fine. When people actually use these computing systems, it requires a lot of applications. The combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost of ownership. The reason for that is because we accelerate so many different things. The second characteristic of our company is the install base.\nYou have to ask yourself, why is it that all the software developers come to our platform? The reason for that is because software developers seek a large install base so that they can reach the largest number of end users, so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make. The third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud, public-facing cloud, because we have so many customers that use so many developers and customers that use our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for internal consumption to develop and train and operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot, all the way to training and inference. We're in the cloud. We're in enterprise. Yesterday, we had a very big announcement.\nIt's really worthwhile to take a look at that. VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise. We've been working together for several years now. We're going to bring together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. Reach is another reason. Because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put NVIDIA's platform in their systems. We have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs, and so on and so forth, because of our reach. Lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were able to sustain this really complex stack of software, hardware, networking, and compute across all of these different usage models and different computing environments.\nWe're able to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering. It seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years. Now we're introducing a new architecture, a new product just about every six months. These properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. Those, in combination, make us special.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line's open.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question, and great job on the results and output. Colette, I have a question on the cool-off list L40S that you guys talked about. Any idea how much of the supply tightness can L40S help with? If you can talk about the incremental profitability or gross margin contribution from this product. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Atif, let me take that for you. The L40 -- L40S is really designed for a different type of application. H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing just very large models and a great deal of data. That's not L40S's focus. L40S's focus is to be able to fine-tune models, fine-tune pre-trained models, and it'll do that incredibly well. It has a transformer engine. It's got a lot of performance. You can get multiple GPUs in a server. It's designed for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers. It comes in a standard rack, standard server, and everything about it is standard, so it's easy to install. L40S also is with the software stack around it, and along with BlueField-3 and all the work that we did with VMware, and the work that we did with Snowflake and ServiceNow, and so many other enterprise partners.\nL40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems. That's the reason why HPE, Dell, Lenovo, and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise. L40S is really designed for a different type of scale-out, if you will. It's, of course, large language models. It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case. The L40S is off to a great start. The world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get L40S deployed.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Next, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I guess the thing about these numbers that's so remarkable to me is the amount of demand that remained unfulfilled. Talking to some of your customers, as good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters. There's a demand, in some cases, for multiples of what people are getting. Can you talk about that? How much unfulfilled demand do you think there is? You talked about visibility extending into next year. Do you have line of sight into when you'll see supply-demand equilibrium here?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. We have excellent visibility through the year and into next year. We're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders. The easiest way to think about the demand is the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's the easiest way to think about the demand.\nThe best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, and improve their cost efficiency is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI. By doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs that the available CPUs in your data center will get boosted. What you're seeing companies do now is recognizing the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition, and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI. That's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us. This isn't a singular application that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening. Data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting in a broad-based way.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Next, we go to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. I had one quick clarification question for Colette and then another one for Jensen. Colette, I think last quarter, you had said CSPs were about 40% of your data center revenue, consumer internet 30%, enterprise 30%. Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer internet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful. Then, Jensen, a question for you. Given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements, and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments.\nI guess I ask the question because there is a concern out there that there could be a bit of a pause in your demand profile in the out years. Curious if there's enough breadth and depth there to support a sustained increase in your data center business going forward. Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nOkay. Thanks, Toshiya, on the question regarding our types of customers that we have in our data center business. We look at it in terms of combining our compute as well as our networking together. Our CSPs, our large CSPs, are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2. The next largest category will be our consumer internet companies, and then the last piece of it will be our enterprise and high-performance computing.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nToshiya, I'm reluctant to guess about the future. I'll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is recognized for some time now that general-purpose computing is just not, and brute forcing general-purpose computing, using general-purpose computing at scale, is no longer the best way to go forward. It's too energy costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow. Finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It's called accelerated computing. What kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. Accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center. By using it, you offload the CPUs, you save a ton of money, an order of magnitude in cost, an order of magnitude in energy, and the throughput is higher. That's what the industry is really responding to.\nGoing forward, the best way to invest in a data center is to divert the capital investment from general-purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers. Accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. The number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It's ready to be deployed. I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, to deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world's clouds. You're seeing a whole crop of new GPU-specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave, and they're doing incredibly well.\nYou're seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now. It's because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest your capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're also seeing that enterprises want to do that. In order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security, and the software-defined data center approach of enterprises. That's called VMware. We've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support not just the virtualization of CPUs, but the virtualization of GPUs, as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking.\nAll of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's Salesforce, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world. This new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation. This will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises. In combination with HP, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI. I think the answer to that question is hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter to quarter. I think the trend is very, very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Can you talk about the attach rate of your networking solutions to the compute that you're shipping? In other words, is half of your compute shipping with your networking solutions, more than half, less than half? Is this something that maybe you can use to prioritize allocation of the GPUs? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, working backwards, we don't use that to prioritize the allocation of our GPUs. We let customers decide what networking they would like to use. For the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer. The reason for that is because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant. Some 10%, 15%, 20% higher throughput for a billion dollars infrastructure translates to enormous savings. Basically, the networking is free.\nIf you have a single application, if you will, infrastructure, or it's largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really a terrific choice. However, if you're hosting for a lot of different users and Ethernet is really core to the way you manage your data center, we have an excellent solution there that we just recently announced, and it's called Spectrum-X. Well, we're going to bring the capabilities, if you will, not all of it, but some of it, of the capabilities of InfiniBand to Ethernet so that we can also, within the environment of Ethernet, allow you to enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities. Spectrum-X is just ramping now. It requires BlueField-3, and it supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches. The additional performance is really spectacular.\nBlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it. BlueField, as all of you know, is a project really dear to my heart. It's off to just a tremendous start. I think it's a home run. This is the concept of in-network computing, and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with BlueField-3. It is going to be a home run.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is now open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for the question and putting me in here. My question is with regard to DGX Cloud. Can you talk about the reception that you're seeing and how the momentum is going? Colette, can you also talk about your software business? What is the run rate right now and the materiality of that business? It does seem like it's already helping margins a bit. Thank you very much.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nDGX Cloud's strategy, let me start there. DGX Cloud's strategy is to achieve several things. Number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs. We recognize that many of our—well, we work with some 30,000 companies around the world. Fifteen thousand of them are startups. Thousands of them are generative AI companies. The fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI. We're working with all of the world's AI startups. Ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds.\nWe built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help land them easily in one of our cloud partners. The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI. To be able to work closely architecturally, to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance, has been really powerful, really terrific. Thirdly, of course, NVIDIA uses very large infrastructures ourselves. Our self-driving car team, our NVIDIA research team, our generative AI team, our language model team, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite significant.\nNone of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems. Even compilers these days require AI. Optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to even develop. It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips. Our own consumption of AI, our robotics team, so on and so forth, Omniverse team, so on and so forth, all needs AI. Our internal consumption is quite large as well. We land that in DGX Cloud. DGX Cloud has multiple use cases, multiple drivers. It's been off to just an enormous success. Our CSPs love it, the developers love it, and our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it. It's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nLet's see if I can answer your question regarding our software revenue. In part of our opening remarks that we made as well, remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they are data center products, GPU systems, or any of our products within gaming, and our future automotive products. You're correct. We're also selling it in a standalone business, and that standalone software continues to grow, where we are providing both the software services, upgrades across there as well. Now, we're seeing at this point probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business. We are looking at NVIDIA AI Enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100. I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces.\nWe're off to a great start. I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does include today's question and answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA",
    "content2": "A new computing era has begun. The industry is simultaneously going through two platform transitions: accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing. The trillion dollars of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency, and cost. Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before-possible applications. Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift. Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding our production capacity.\nSupply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year. NVIDIA has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world's industries can build upon. What makes NVIDIA special are: one, architecture. NVIDIA accelerates everything from data processing, training, inference, every AI model, real-time speech to computer vision, and giant recommenders to vector databases. The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO, and best energy efficiency. Two, install base. NVIDIA has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide. Developers need a large install base to reach end users and grow their business. NVIDIA is the developer's preferred platform. More developers create more applications that make NVIDIA more valuable for customers. Three, reach. NVIDIA is in clouds, enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments, and robotics.\nEach has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems. System suppliers like OEMs, computer OEMs, can confidently invest in NVIDIA because we offer significant market demand and reach, scale, and velocity. NVIDIA has achieved significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI. Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus, and scale to deliver a strong roadmap and reach to help them grow. We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities. We're upgrading and adding new products about every six months versus every two years to address the expanding universe of generative AI. While we increase the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we're ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers.\nSpectrum-X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3 SuperNIC, and software, helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures. Customers are already working on next-generation accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper. We're extending NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises that demand generative AI, but with the model privacy, security, and sovereignty. Together with the world's leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty Images, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware, and WPP, and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world's enterprise. We're building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world's multi-trillion-dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity.\nGenerative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world's largest industries, where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains. It is an exciting time for NVIDIA, our customers, partners, and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

    "content": "Q1 2024 NVIDIA Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2024 NVIDIA Corp Earnings Call\n\nNVDANASDAQMAY 24, 5:00 PM\n\nSimona Jankowski\n\nVP of Investor Relations, NVIDIA\n\nAs of today, 24 May 2023, based on information currently available to us, except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nCFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was $7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially, and down 13% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue, with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections. Starting with data center, record revenue of $4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially, and up 14% year-on-year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA Accelerated Computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based, global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories: cloud service providers, or CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises.\nFirst, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer AI applications for training and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H-100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS, and general availability at emerging GPU-specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H-100 from generative AI pioneers. Second, consumer internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting generative AI and deep learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth. For example, Meta has now deployed its H-100-powered Grand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams. Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong.\nWe are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, healthcare, and telecom, where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation roadmaps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a 50 billion parameter model, BloombergGPT, to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification, and question answering. Auto insurance company CCC Intelligence Solutions is using AI for estimating repairs. AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte for logistics and customer service, and Amgen for drug discovery and protein engineering. This quarter, we started shipping DGX H-100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem.\nWith the launch of DGX Cloud through our partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we deliver the promise of NVIDIA DGX to customers from the cloud. Whether the customers deploy DGX on-prem or via DGX Cloud, they get access to NVIDIA AI software, including NVIDIA Base Command, end-to-end AI frameworks, and pre-trained models. We provide them with a blueprint for building and operating AI, spanning our expertise across systems, algorithms, data processing, and training methods. We also announced NVIDIA AI Foundations, which are model foundry services available on DGX Cloud that enable businesses to build, refine, and operate custom large language models and generative AI models trained with their own proprietary data, created for unique domain-specific tasks. They include NVIDIA NEMO for large language models, NVIDIA Picasso for images, video, and 3D, and NVIDIA BioNEMO for life sciences.\nEach service has six elements: pre-trained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based vector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning, and guardrailing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases. ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform, is an early adopter of DGX Cloud and NEMO. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform. Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings for the thousands of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers. Generative AI is also driving a step function increase in inference workloads because of their size and complexities. These workloads require acceleration.\nThe latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April showed NVIDIA's inference platforms deliver performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry, with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads. To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced four major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video, L40 for Omniverse and graphics rendering, H-100 NVL for large language models, and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLMs and also recommendation systems and vector databases. Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads, such as Google Cloud DataProc, Google Alph, Google AlphaFold, and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences.\nIn addition, Google is integrating our Triton inference server with Google Kubernetes Engine, and its cloud-based Vertex AI platform. In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general-purpose CPU infrastructure remains soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high-performance networks become essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demands of both training and inferencing. Our 400-gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI-dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer internet platforms such as Microsoft Azure. With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment.\nFor multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI, our high-speed Ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching offers the highest available Ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft, Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu, and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400-gig Spectrum-4 Accelerated AI Networking Platform next week at the Computex Conference in Taiwan. Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which is 6x more energy efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to the growing momentum for Grace with both CPU-only and CPU-GPU opportunities across AI, cloud, and supercomputing applications.\nThe coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace, and Grace Hopper Superchips will enable a new generation of super energy-efficient accelerated data centers. Now, let's move to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially and down 38% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40-series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall, demand was solid and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop. The GeForce RTX 40-series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring four NVIDIA inventions: RTX Path Tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex ultra-low latency rendering, and Max-Q energy-efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance, and battery life for gamers and creators.\nLike our desktop offerings, 40-series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform of software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti GPUs. The RTX 4070 is nearly 3x faster than the RTX 2070 and offers our large installed base a spectacular upgrade. Last week, we launched the 60-family RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti, bringing our newest architecture to the world's core gamers starting at just $299. These GPUs, for the first time, provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 Ti is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July. Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to runtime.\nAt the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI-powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers and NEMO LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs a supercharged platform for generative AI. Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The first game from this partnership, Gears 5, is now available, with more set to be released in the coming months. There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service. Moving to ProVisualization, revenue of $295 million was up 31% sequentially and down 53% year-on-year.\nSequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as public sector, healthcare, and automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our ADA Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicks off a major product cycle. At GTC, we announced six new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations, with further rollouts planned in the coming quarters. Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstations. Our collaboration with Microsoft transformed Windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, an NVIDIA fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure, that includes the full suite of Omniverse applications and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure. Using this full-stack cloud environment, customers can design, develop, deploy, and manage industrial metaverse applications.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available starting in the second half of this year. Microsoft and NVIDIA will also connect Office 365 applications with Omniverse. Omniverse Cloud is being used by companies to digitalize their workflows from design and engineering to smart factories, and 3D content generation for marketing. The automotive industry has been a leading early adopter of Omniverse, including companies such as BMW Group, Hyundai, Lotus, General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover. Moving to automotive, revenue was $296 million, up 1% sequentially and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA Drive Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now stands at $14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years.\nSequentially, growth moderated as some NEV customers in China are adjusting their production schedules to reflect slower-than-expected demand growth. We expect this dynamic to linger for the rest of the calendar year. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with BYD, the world's leading manufacturer of NEVs. Our new design win will extend BYD's use of the Drive Orin to its next-generation high-volume Dynasty and Ocean series of vehicles, set to start production in calendar 2024. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margins were 64.6%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 66.8%. Gross margins have now largely recovered to prior peak levels, and we have absorbed higher costs and offset them by innovating and delivering higher-valued products, as well as products incorporating more and more software. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were down 3%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%.\nWe have held OpEx at roughly the same level over the last four quarters while working through the inventory corrections in gaming and professional visualization. We now expect to increase investments in the business, while also delivering operating leverage. We returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. At the end of Q1, we have approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $11 billion, ±2%. We expect this sequential growth to largely be driven by data center, reflecting a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models. This demand has extended our data center visibility out a few quarters, and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year.\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.71 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $90 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 to 350 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some of the upcoming events. Jensen will give the Computex keynote address in person in Taipei this coming Monday, 29 May 2023, local time, which will be Sunday evening in the US.\nIn addition, we will be attending the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on 6 June 2024, Rosenblatt Virtual Technology Summit on the Age of AI on 7 June 2024, and the New Street Future of Transportation Virtual Conference on 12 June 2024. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter, fiscal 2024, is scheduled for Wednesday, 23 August 2024. Well, that covers our opening remarks. We're now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line's open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results and incredible outlook. Just one question on data center. Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to what the key drivers are from April to July, and perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point. What kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nCFO, NVIDIA\n\nOkay, a lot of different questions there. Let me see if I can start, and I'm sure Jensen will have some following-up comments. When we talk about our sequential growth that we're expected between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI large language models are driving this surge in demand, and it's broad-based across both our consumer internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI startups. It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth, and we also expect to see growth both in our computing as well as in our networking business. Those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance that we have provided to Q2.\nWe also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have some significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see, and this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers. They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises, also setting things up at the CSPs, and the large consumer internet companies. We have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters, and this led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nI thought that was great, Colette. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line's open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I guess with data center, you know, essentially doubling quarter on quarter, two natural kind of questions that relate to one another come to mind. Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? As part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing the commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times in the coming years to best kind of match that supply and demand? Thanks so much.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, CJ, thanks for the question. I'll still start backwards. Remember, we were in full production of both Ampere and Hopper when the ChatGPT moment came, and it helped everybody crystallize how to transition from the technology of large language models to a product and service based on a chatbot. The integration of guardrails and alignment systems with reinforcement learning, human feedback, knowledge vector databases for proprietary knowledge, connection to search, all of that came together in a really wonderful way. The reason why I call it the iPhone moment, all the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product it can be and what capabilities it can have. We were already in full production. NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant, as you know. We build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems, and we build them in volume.\nIt includes, of course, the GPUs, but on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components. The networking, the fiber optics, the incredible transceivers, the NICs, the smart NICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand up a data center. We were already in full production, and when the moment came, we had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half, as Colette said. Now, let me talk about the bigger picture and why the entire world's data centers are moving towards accelerated computing. It's been known for some time, and you've heard me talk about it, that accelerated computing is a full-stack problem, but it's a full-stack challenge.\nIf you could successfully do it in a large number of application domains, it's taken us 15 years, sufficiently that almost the entire data center's major applications could be accelerated. You could reduce the amount of energy consumed and the amount of cost for a data center substantially by an order of magnitude. It costs a lot of money to do it because you have to do all the software and everything, and you have to build all the systems and so on and so forth. We've been at it for 15 years. What happened is when generative AI came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. Now we see ourselves in two simultaneous transitions. The world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today.\n$1 trillion, $250 billion a year, it's growing, of course, but over the last four years, call it a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure installed. It's all completely based on CPUs and DOMNICs. It's basically unaccelerated. In the future, it's fairly clear now with generative AI becoming the primary workload of most of the world's data centers generating information. It is very clear now, and the fact that accelerated computing is so energy efficient, that the budget of a data center will shift very dramatically towards accelerated computing. You're seeing that now. We're going through that moment right now as we speak while the world's data center CapEx budget is limited. At the same time, we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers.\nI think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing to accelerated computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs, and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, we'll move to our next question, Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line's open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Semiconductor Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThanks for the question. Colette, just wanted to clarify, does visibility mean data center sales can continue to grow sequentially in Q3 and Q4, or do they sustain at Q2 levels? I just wanted to clarify that. Jensen, my question is that given this very strong demand environment, what does it do to the competitive landscape? Does it invite more competition in terms of custom ASICs? Does it invite more competition in terms of other GPU solutions or other kinds of solutions? How do you see the competitive landscape change over the next two to three years?\n\nColette Kress\n\nCFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, Vivek, thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1 2024. We are expecting not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 2024 for our forecast, but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here that we're not here to guide the second half, but yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nRegarding competition, we have competition from every direction. Startups, really, really well-funded and innovative startups, countless of them all over the world. We have competition from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects, and many of you know about most of these. We're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time. NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution. The reason for that is because accelerated computing is two things that I talk about often, which is it's a full-stack problem. It's a full-stack challenge.\nYou have to engineer all of the software, all the libraries, and all the algorithms, integrate them into and optimize the frameworks, and optimize it for the architecture of not just one chip, but the architecture of an entire data center, all the way into the frameworks, all the way into the models. The amount of engineering and distributed computing, fundamental computer science work is really quite extraordinary. It is the hardest computing as we know. Number one, it's a full-stack challenge, and you have to optimize it across the whole thing and across just a mind-blowing number of stacks. We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind-blowing. The second part is that generative AI is a large-scale problem, and it's a data center-scale problem.\nIt's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center, or the data center is the computer. It's not the chip. It's the data center. It's never happened like this before. In this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches, and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer, and that's what you're trying to operate. In order to get the best performance, you have to understand full-stack and understand data center scale. That's what accelerated computing is. The second thing is that utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and the versatility of your architecture, keeps the utilization high.\nIf you can do one thing and do one thing only and incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized, and it's hard to scale that out. NVIDIA's universal GPU and the fact that we accelerate so many stacks makes our utilization incredibly high. Number one is throughput, and that's software-intensive problems, a data center architecture problem. The second is utilization versatility problem. The third is just data center expertise. We've built five data centers of our own, and we've helped companies all over the world build data centers. We integrate our architecture into all the world's clouds. From the moment of delivery of the product to standing up and the deployment, the time to operations of a data center is measured. If you're not good at it and if you're not proficient at it, it could take months.\nStanding up a supercomputer, let's see. Some of the largest supercomputers in the world were installed about a year and a half ago, and now they're coming online. It's not unheard of to see a delivery to operations of about a year. Our delivery to operations measured in weeks. We've taken data centers and supercomputers, and we've turned it into products. The expertise of the team in doing that is incredible. Our value proposition is, in the final analysis, all of this technology translates into infrastructure, the highest throughput, and the lowest possible cost. I think our market is, of course, very competitive, very large, but the challenge is really, really great.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line's open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nTechnology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. As we kind of think about unpacking the various different growth drivers of the data center business going forward, I'm curious, Colette, of just how we should think about the monetization effect of software, considering that the expansion of your cloud service agreements continues to grow. I'm curious of where do you think we're at in terms of that approach, in terms of the AI Enterprise software suite and other drivers of software-only revenue going forward?\n\nColette Kress\n\nCFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks for the question. Software is really important to our accelerated platforms. Not only do we have a substantial amount of software that we are including in our newest architecture, and essentially all products that we have, we are now with many different models to help customers start their work in generative AI and accelerated computing. Anything that we have here from DGX Cloud on providing those services, helping them build models, or as you've discussed, the importance of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, essentially that operating system for AI. All things should continue to grow as we go forward, both the architecture and the infrastructure, as well as both the availability of the software and our ability to monetize that with it as well. I'll turn it over to Jensen to take a list.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, we can see in real time the growth of generative AI and CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already. There are two segments that require a new stack of software.\nThe two segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt them for your proprietary use case and your proprietary data, in alignment to your own principles and your own operating domains. You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high-performance computing sandbox, and we call that DGX Cloud, and to create that model. You want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any cloud because you have services and you have agreements with multiple cloud vendors, and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds. For the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundation for helping you create custom models, and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack, GPU-accelerated stack in the world that is enterprise-safe and enterprise-supported. There are constant patching that you have to do. There are 4,000 different packages that build up NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine, end-to-end operating engine, of the entire AI workflow. It's the only one of its kind. From data ingestion, data processing, obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data you have to process, package up, curate, and align. There's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time. Data processing is a very big deal.\nThe second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model, and the third is deploying the model for inferencing. NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches, and security patches continuously, all of those 4,000 packages of software. For an enterprise that wants to deploy their engines, just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software. In order to deploy that in every cloud, as well as on-prem, it has to be secure. It has to be supported. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second part. The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics, you need to align the AI for physics. Aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback.\nIn the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. Omniverse is a vital engine for software-defined and robotic applications and industries. Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform. Our software stack, the three software stacks, AI Foundation, AI Enterprise, and Omniverse, runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI as well as Omniverse with GCP and Oracle. We have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI. AI Enterprise is integrated into all three of them. I think in order for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud and into the world's enterprise and into the world's industries, you need two new types of you need new software stacks in order to make that happen.\nBy putting it in the cloud, integrated into the world's CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales, the marketing team, and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line's open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I had a question, and then I had a clarification as well. The question first is, Jensen, on the InfiniBand versus Ethernet argument, can you sort of speak to that debate and maybe how you see it playing out? I know you need the low latency of InfiniBand for AI, but can you sort of talk about the attach rate of your InfiniBand solutions to what you're shipping on the core compute side and maybe whether that's similarly crowding out Ethernet like you are on the compute side? The clarification, Colette, is that there wasn't a share buyback despite you still having about $7 billion on the share repo authorization. Was that just timing? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nColette, how about you go first and take the question?\n\nColette Kress\n\nCFO, NVIDIA\n\nSure. That is correct. We have $7 billion available in recurrent authorization for repurchases. We did not repurchase anything in this last quarter, but we do repurchase opportunistically and will consider that as we go forward as well. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nInfiniBand and Ethernet target different applications in a data center. They both have their place. InfiniBand had a record quarter. We're going to have a giant record year. InfiniBand has a really, NVIDIA's and Quantum InfiniBand has an exceptional roadmap. It's going to be really incredible. The two networks are very different. InfiniBand is designed for an AI factory, if you will.\nIf that data center is running a few applications for a few people for a specific use case, and it's doing it continuously, and that infrastructure costs you, pick a number, $500 million. The difference between InfiniBand and Ethernet could be 15% to 20 in overall throughput. If you spent $500 million in infrastructure and the difference is 10% to 20, and it's $100 million, InfiniBand's basically free. That's the reason why people use it. InfiniBand is effectively free. The difference in data center throughput is just too great to ignore. You're using it for that one application. However, if your data center is a cloud data center and it's multi-tenant, it's a bunch of little jobs, a bunch of little jobs, and it's shared by millions of people, then Ethernet's really the right answer.\nThere's a new segment in the middle where the cloud is becoming a generative AI cloud. It's not an AI factory per se, but it's still a multi-tenant cloud, but it wants to run generative AI workloads. This new segment is a wonderful opportunity. At Computex, I referred to it at the last GTC. At Computex, we're going to announce a major product line for this segment, which is for Ethernet-focused generative AI application type of clouds. InfiniBand is doing fantastically, and we're doing record numbers quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line's open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on inference versus training for generative AI. You're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess two subparts of that. Is that because inference basically scales with the usage versus training is more of a one-and-done? Can you give us some sort of, even if it's just qualitatively, do you think inference is bigger than training or vice versa? If it's bigger, how much bigger is it? Is the opportunity, is it 5x? Is it 10x? If anything you can give us on those two workloads within generative AI would be helpful.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. I'll work backwards. You're never done with training. Every time you deploy, you're collecting new data. When you collect new data, you train with the new data, so you're never done training. You're never done producing and processing a vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured, unstructured data that you have.\nWhether you're building a recommender system, a large language model, or a vector database, these are probably the three major applications, the three core engines, if you will, of the future of computing. There's a whole bunch of other stuff, but obviously, these are three very important ones. They're always running. You're going to see that more and more companies realize they have a factory for intelligence, an intelligence factory. In that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data, vectorizing data, and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth. The inference part of it, our APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that are integrated into workflows, but APIs of all kinds. There would be hundreds of APIs in a company. Some of them they built themselves.\nSome of them part that many of them could come from companies like ServiceNow and Adobe that we're partnering with in AI Foundations. They'll create a whole bunch of generative AI APIs that companies can then connect into their workflows or use as an application. Of course, there'd be a whole bunch of internet service companies. I think you're seeing for the very first time simultaneously a very significant growth in the segment of AI factories, as well as a market, a segment that really didn't exist before, but now it's growing exponentially, practically by the week, for AI inference with APIs. The simple way to think about it in the end is that the world has a trillion dollars of data center installed, and they used to be 100% CPUs. In the future, we've heard it in enough places.\nI think this year's ISC keynote was actually about the end of Moore's Law. We've seen it in a lot of places now that you can't reasonably scale out data centers with general purpose computing, and that accelerated computing is the path forward. Now it's got a killer app. It's called generative AI. The easiest way to think about that is your trillion-dollar infrastructure. Every quarter's CapEx budget would lean very heavily into generative AI, into accelerated computing infrastructure everywhere, from the number of GPUs that would be used in the CapEx budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated networking chips that connect them all. The easiest way to think about that is over the next 4, 5, 10 years, most of that trillion dollars, and then compensating, adjusting for all the growth in data centers, still will be largely generative AI.\nThat's probably the easiest way to think about that. That's training as well as inference.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Next, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line's open.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I wanted to follow up on that. In terms of the focus on inference, it's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models. The cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. Can you talk about the ramifications of that for you guys? Is that where some of the specialty inference products that you launched at GTC come in? Just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, that's a great question. Whether you start by building a large language model and you use that large language model, very large version, you could distill them into medium, small, and tiny size. The tiny size ones, you could put in your phone, your PC, and so on and so forth. They all have good, they all have, it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. Obviously, the zero-shot or the generalizability of the large language model, the biggest one, is much more versatile, and it can do a lot more amazing things. The large one would teach the smaller ones how to be good AIs. You use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones, and so on and so forth.\nYou start by building very large ones, and then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones. That's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference. You saw that I announced L4, L40, H100 MVL, which also has H100. We have H100 HGX, and then we have H100 multi-node with NVLink. You could have model sizes of any kind that you like. The other thing that's important is these are models, but they're connected ultimately to applications. The applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out. The input and the output require a lot of pre- and post-processing. The pre- and post-processing can't be ignored.\nThis is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart. It's because the model itself is only, call it 25% of the data of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about pre-processing, post-processing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that. I think the multimodality aspect of inference, the multi-diversity of inference, that it's going to be done in the cloud, on-prem, it's going to be done in multi-cloud. That's the reason why we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-prem. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell. We just announced the other day called Project Helix. That's going to be integrated into third-party services.\nThat's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow and Adobe, because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. The diversity and the reach of generative AI is so broad. You need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described in order to really address the whole space of it.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line's open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nHead of Semiconductor Capital Equipment Team, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I really appreciate more of the focus or some of the focus today on your networking products. I mean, it's really an integral part to sort of maximize the full performance of your compute platforms. I think your data center networking business is driving about $1 billion of revenues per quarter, plus or minus. That's 2.5x growth from three years ago when you guys acquired Mellanox, so very strong growth. Given the very high attach of your InfiniBand, Ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run rate stepping up in line with your compute shipment? What is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, data sets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability, and so on?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Harlan, I really appreciate that. Nearly everybody who thinks about AI, they think about that chip, that accelerator chip. In fact, it misses the whole point nearly completely. I've mentioned before that accelerated computing is about the stack, about the software. Networking, remember, we announced very early on this networking stack called DOCA.\nWe have an acceleration library called Magnum IO. These two pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect tens of thousands of GPUs. How do you connect tens of thousands of GPUs if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great? That's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. One of the great things that we have—we have Mellanox, as you know quite well—was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high-performance networking. It is the reason why our two companies are together. You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with really super low latency.\nIt communicates using memory references, not network packets. We take NVLink, connect it inside multiple GPUs. I've described going beyond the GPU, and I'll talk a lot more about that at Computex in a few days. That gets connected to InfiniBand, which includes the NIC and the SmartNIC, BlueField-3 that we're in full production with, and the switches, all of the fiber optics that are optimized end-to-end. These things are running at incredible line rates. Beyond that, if you want to connect the smart AI factory, this AI factory into your computing fabric, we have a brand new type of Ethernet that we'll be announcing at Computex.\nThis whole area of the computing fabric, extending, connecting all of these GPUs and computing units together all the way through the networking, through the switches, the software stack is insanely complicated. I'm delighted you understand it. We don't break it out particularly because we think of the whole thing as a computing platform as it should be. We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like, and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up.\nIt's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world, from cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G. This way of doing it is really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line's open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Congratulations, Jensen, and to the whole team. One of the things I wanted to dig into a little bit is the DGX Cloud offering. You guys have been working on this for some time behind the scenes where you sell in the hardware to your hyperscale partners and then lease it back for your own business.\nThe rest of us kind of found out about it publicly a few months ago. As we look forward over the next number of quarters, as Colette discussed, to high visibility in the data center business, maybe you could talk a little bit about the mix you're seeing of hyperscale customers buying for their own first-party internal workloads versus their own sort of third-party, their own customers, versus what of that big upside in data center going forward is systems that you're selling in with potential to support your DGX Cloud offerings and what you've learned since you've launched it about the potential of that business. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Without being too specific about numbers, the ideal scenario, the ideal mix is something like 10% NVIDIA DGX Cloud and 90% the CSPs clouds. Our DGX Cloud is the NVIDIA stack. It's the pure NVIDIA stack.\nIt is architected the way we like and achieves the best possible performance. It gives us the ability to partner very deeply with the CSPs to create the highest-performing infrastructure, number one. Number two, it allows us to partner with the CSPs to create markets. For example, we're partnering with Azure to bring Omniverse Cloud to the world's industries. The world's never had a system like that, the computing stack with all the generative AI stuff, all the 3D stuff, and the physics stuff, incredibly large database, and really high-speed networks and low-latency networks. That kind of industrial virtual world has never existed before. We partner with Microsoft to create Omniverse Cloud inside Azure Cloud. That allows us, number two, to create new applications together and develop new markets together. We can go to market as one team.\nWe benefit by getting customers on our computing platform, and they benefit by having us in their cloud, number one. Number two, the amount of data, services, and security services, and all of the amazing things that Azure, GCP, and OCI have, they can instantly have access to that through Omniverse Cloud. It's a huge win-win. For the customers, the way that NVIDIA's cloud works for these early applications, they could do it anywhere. One standard stack runs in all the clouds. If they would like to take their software and run it on the CSPs' cloud themselves and manage it themselves, we're delighted by that because NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA AI Foundations, and long-term, this is going to take a little longer, but NVIDIA Omniverse will run in the CSPs' clouds. Okay.\nOur goal really is to drive architecture, to partner deeply in creating new markets, and the new applications that we're doing, and provide our customers with the flexibilities to run NVIDIA everywhere, including on-prem. Those were the primary reasons for it. It's worked out incredibly. Our partnership with the three CSPs that we currently have DGX Cloud in, and their sales force, marketing teams, and leadership teams is really quite spectacular. It works great.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions: accelerated computing and generative AI. CPU scaling has slowed, yet computing demand is strong. Now with generative AI, supercharged. Accelerated computing, a full-stack and data center-scale approach that NVIDIA pioneered, is the best path forward.\nThere's a trillion dollars installed in the global data center infrastructure based on the general-purpose computing method of the last era. Companies are now racing to deploy accelerated computing for the generative AI era. Over the next decade, most of the world's data centers will be accelerated. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet their surging demand. Large language models can learn information encoded in many forms. Guided by large language models, generative AI models can generate amazing content. With models to fine-tune, guardrail, align to guiding principles, and ground to facts, generative AI is emerging from labs and is on its way to industrial applications.\nAs we scale with cloud and internet service providers, we are also building platforms for the world's largest enterprises, whether within one of our CSP partners or on-prem with Dell Helix, whether on a leading enterprise platform like ServiceNow, Adobe, or bespoke with NVIDIA AI Foundations, we can help enterprises leverage their domain expertise and data to harness generative AI securely and safely. We are ramping a wave of products in the coming quarters, including H100, our Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips, and our BlueField-3 and Spectrum-4 networking platform. They are all in production. They will help deliver data center-scale computing that is also energy-efficient and sustainable computing. Join us next week at Computex, and we'll show you what's next. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you, Simona. Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion US dollars, up 2% sequentially, and down 21% year-on-year. Full year revenue was $27 billion US dollars, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center, revenue was $3.62 billion US dollars, down 6% sequentially, and up 11% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion US dollars, up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans.\nThough we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. Networking grew, but a bit less than we expected on software demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues.\nWith cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU-specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of data center as a whole, as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing four-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our data center revenue. Adoption of our new flagship H100 data center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially.\nThis is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as 9x faster than the A100 for training and up to 30x faster than inferencing of transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale-out of inference of large language models. AI adoption is at an inflection point. OpenAI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand, and showing what's possible with generative AI.\nThese new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents, creating images for ads or video games, or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more, faster. Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world.\nNVIDIA's expertise spans across AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing, and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprise. We look forward to helping customers with generative AI opportunities. In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer internet companies, enterprises, and startups. The opportunity is significant, and driving strong growth in the data center that will accelerate through the year.\nDuring the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry vehicles. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services. Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection, and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.\nWe also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC-optimized Ethernet platforms, fueled by AI. Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads.\nDelivering unmatched performance, latency, and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient, cloud-scale generative AI. For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum-2 400 Gb per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise, and supercomputing customers.\nIn Ethernet, our 40 Gb per second Spectrum-4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adapters, and switches. We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pre-trained models, and new workflows for contact center intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription, and cybersecurity. Upcoming offerings include our NeMo and BioNeMo large language model services, which are currently in early access with customers.\nNow, we turn to Jensen to talk a bit more about our software and cloud.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Colette. The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI's versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing, and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most. Today, I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer.\nWe are partnering with major cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform while remaining close to the storage, networking, security, and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds.\nCustomers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software, or pre-trained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer. Just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, and others on the way.\nAt the AI platform software layer, customers can access NVIDIA AI Enterprise for training and deploying large language models or other AI workloads. At the pre-trained generative AI model layer, we will be offering NeMo and BioNeMo, customizable AI models to enterprise customers who want to build proprietary generative AI models and services for their businesses. With our new business model, customers can engage NVIDIA's full scale of AI computing across their private to any public cloud. We will share more details about NVIDIA AI Cloud Services at our upcoming GTC, so be sure to tune in.\nNow, let me turn it back to Colette on gaming.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion US dollars was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion US dollars is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. Demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions.\nWhile China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market. Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX 4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock. The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the Ada architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphics.\nEarlier this month, the first wave of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment previously limited to basic tasks and apps. In another first, we are bringing the 90-class GPUs, our most performant models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology.\nAll in, RTX 40 series GPUs will power over 170 gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-school season. There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The Ada architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance.\nOne of the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3, enabling a 3x to 4x boost in frame rate performance at 4K resolution. Our GeForce Now cloud gaming service continues to expand in multiple dimensions: users, titles, and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance Ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.\nYesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce Now Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo, and Flight Simulator. Upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch. Moving to Pro visualization.\nRevenue of $226 million US dollars was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion US dollars was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations, with strength in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year. Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build, with almost 300,000 downloads so far, and 185 connectors to third-party design applications.\nThe latest release of Omniverse adds a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K real-time path tracing, Omniverse Deep Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse Cloud Containers for AWS. Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million US dollars, up 17% and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions.\nNew program grants at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million US dollars was up 60%. At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. This partnership will provide scale for volume manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive Hyperion Compute and Sensor Architecture for its electric vehicles.\nFoxconn will be a tier-one manufacturer producing electronic control units based on the NVIDIA Drive O-RAN for the global automotive market. We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from TÜV SÜD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation. Moving to the rest of the P&L.\nGAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%. Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year-on-year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%.\nWe plan to keep them relatively flat at these levels over the incoming quarter. Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. We returned $1.15 billion US dollars to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $7 billion US dollars remaining under our share repurchase authorizations through December 2023. Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our four major market platforms, led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion US dollars, ±2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion US dollars.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion US dollars. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million US dollars, excluding gains and losses of non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million US dollars to 400 million US dollars for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion US dollars to 1.3 billion US dollars for the full fiscal year 2024.\nFurther financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on 6 March 2024 in San Francisco, and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on 7 March 2024 in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually, with Jensen's keynote kicking off on 21 March 2024. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, 24 May 2024.\nNow, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\nYour first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking a question. Clearly, on this call, a key focal point is going to be the monetization effect of your software and cloud strategy. I think, as we look at it, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite is priced at around $6,000 US dollars per CPU socket. I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model. I'm just curious, Colette, how do we start to think about that monetization contribution to the company's business model over the next couple of quarters relative to, I think, in the past, you've talked to a couple hundred million or so. Just curious if you can unpack that a little bit.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nI'll start and turn it over to Jensen to talk more, because I believe this will be a great topic and discussion also at our GTC. Our plans in terms of software, we continue to see growth. Even in our Q4 results, we're making quite good progress in both working with our partners, onboarding more partners, and increasing our software. You are correct. We've talked about our software revenues being in the hundreds of millions, and we're getting even stronger each day as Q4 was probably a record level in terms of our software levels. There's more to unpack in terms of there, and I'm going to turn it to Jensen.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, first of all, taking a step back, you know NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today. It starts from data processing to learning, training, validations, to inference. This body of software is completely accelerated. It runs in every cloud, it runs on-prem, and it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere. By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost-effective. You save money by using accelerated software.\nOur announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and having it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI Enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software.\nIt is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pre-trained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. We're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if you meant data center could grow on a year-on-year basis also in Q1. Jensen, my main question kind of relates to two small related ones. The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? On the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from Cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThat's exactly. Thanks for the question. First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1, we do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth, and we are also expecting a growth year-over-year for our data center. We actually expect a great year with our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerating past Q1.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nLarge language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law in its best days would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks, algorithms, and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster.\nWhat would have taken a couple of months in the beginning now happens in about 10 days. You still need a large infrastructure. Even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, its new NVLink switches, and its new InfiniBand 400 Gb per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models.\nI think by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX Cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure and, with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. That's one thought. The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different.\nDifferent fields, different domains, whether it's imaging, or it's biology, or it's physics, each one of them needs their own domain of foundation models. With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting. The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data.\nThe most valuable data in the world are proprietary, and they belong to the company. It's inside their company. It'll never leave the company. That body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. Our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and proprietary models.\nThe second thing about competition, we've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training. You can use it for inference. You could use it for models of all different types. It supports every framework, it supports every cloud, it's everywhere.\nIt's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This one architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere. The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application. There's a pre-processing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post-processing because it's maybe not as sexy, and not as interesting.\nHowever, it turns out the pre-processing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or 2/3 of the overall workload. By accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline from pre-processing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the pre-processing, all the way to post-processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline.\nThe limit to speed up, even if you're instantly fast, if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50 times faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up.\nThe reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end. I think the universality of our accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way.\nMost importantly, to all the service providers, because the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. The comparison is not even close. Anyhow, those are the two answers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nChristopher Muse\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, you talked about ChatGPT as an inflection point, kind of like the iPhone. Curious, Part A, how have your conversations evolved post-ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises? Secondly, as you think about Hopper with the transformer engine and Grace with high bandwidth memory, how have your outlook for growth for those two product cycles evolved in the last few months? Thanks so much.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job. OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it, and the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability. What people were surprised by, and this is in our close within the industry as well understood, was the surprising capability of a single AI model that could perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do.\nFor this language model to not just speak English or translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. It is a program that writes a program for another program. We now realize that the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed.\nThis new computer, when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that it processes directly or waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not. This type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because its democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world.\nEvery single CSP, every single internet service provider, and frankly, every single software company because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert, or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service. This is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide.\nThe activity around the AI infrastructures that we build, Hopper, and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. There is no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\n\nMatthew Ramsay\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DGX Cloud. I guess we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers. I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems-level business, meaning pairing InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product, and selling things more on a systems level.\nI wonder if you could step back and, over the next two or three years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? What can that mean for the margins of that business over time? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, appreciate the question. First of all, as you know, our data center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of eight Hoppers or eight Amperes that is connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink.\nThis board represents essentially one GPU. It's eight chips connected together into one GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. We've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. That is one GPU. When we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's eight GPUs. We're going to continue to do that.\nThe thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI startups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. All of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least, or into the cloud and on-prem, and oftentimes multi-cloud.\nBy having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure, our full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. They welcomed us with open arms. We're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds. For the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced.\nThey have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI Open Operating System, all the way up to AI models. Within one entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. This is a great model for customers, a great model for CSPs, and a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind.\nAs much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. Now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Jensen, I had a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on tech, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there. It seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe on the high end at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands more to inference a widely deployed model.\nIt seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion US dollars hardware TAM and $300 billion US dollars software TAM. How do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nI think those numbers are really good anchors still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI, and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened towards the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry.\nEvery single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program, and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications.\nBecause it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applications, part cloud, part on a mobile device, and so easy to distribute because of App Stores, the same exact thing is now happening to AI. In no computing era did one computing platform, ChatGPT, reach 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. People were using it to create all kinds of things.\nI think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging. There's no question this is, in every way, a new computing era. I think the TAM that we explained and expressed, it really is even more realizable today and sooner than before.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Semiconductor Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a clarification and then a question both for Colette. The clarification, you said H100 revenue is higher than A100. Was that an overall statement or was that at the same point in time, like after two quarters of shipments? For my actual question, I wanted to ask about auto, specifically the Mercedes opportunity.\nMercedes had an event today, and they were talking about software revenues for their MB drive that could be single digit or low billion euros by mid-decade and mid-billion euros by the end of the decade. I know you guys were supposedly splitting software revenues 50/50. Is that kind of the order of magnitude of software revenues from the Mercedes deal that you guys are thinking of over that similar timeframe? Is that how we should be modeling that? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nGreat. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let me first start with your question you had about H100 and A100. We began initial shipments of H100 back in Q3. It was a great start. Many of them began that process many quarters ago. This was a time for us to get production level to them in Q3. Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H100 that we saw.\nWhat that means is our H100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4. They were all wanting to both get up and running in cloud instances. We actually saw less of A100 in Q4 of what we saw in H100 being a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but just in Q4, it was a strong quarter for H100.\nNow, your additional questions that you had on Mercedes-Benz. Very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working very diligently at both getting ready to come to market. You're right, they did talk about the software opportunity. They talked about their software opportunity in two phases, about what they can do with drive, as well as what they can also do with connect. They extended out to a position of probably about 10 years, looking at the opportunity that they see in front of us. It aligned with what our thoughts are with a long-term partner of that, and sharing that revenue over time.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. One of the things that I could add, Stacey, to say something about the wisdom of what Mercedes is doing. This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an install base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward.\nIf you could just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet that is on the road today were completely programmable, that you can OTA, it would represent tens of millions of Mercedeses that would represent revenue-generating opportunity. That's the vision that Ola has and what they're building towards. I think it's going to be extraordinary. A large install base of luxury cars that will continue to renew for customers' benefits, and also for revenue-generating benefits.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Lipacis\n\nSenior Semiconductor Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I think for you, Jensen, it seems like every year a new workload comes out and drives demand for your process or your ecosystem cycles. If I think back, facial recognition, then recommendation engines, natural language processing, Omniverse, and now generative AI engines. Can you share with us your view? Is this what we should expect going forward, like a brand new workload that drives demand to the next level for your products?\nThe reason I ask is because I found it interesting your comments in your script where you mentioned that your kind of view about the demand that generative AI is going to drive for your products and now services seems to be a lot better than what you thought just over the last 90 days. To the extent that there's new workloads that you're working on or new applications that can drive next levels of demand, would you care to share with us a little bit of what you think could drive it past what you're seeing today? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, Mark, I really appreciate the question. First of all, I have new applications that you don't know about and new workloads that we've never shared that I would like to share with you at GTC. That's my hook to come to GTC. I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about.\nNow, there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is, number one, NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95%, 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way.\nWe're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that could be highly paralyzed to offload them. We're multi-domain. We could do particle systems, fluids, neurons, and we can do computer graphics. We could do rays. There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate, number one. Number two, our install base is so large.\nThis is the only accelerated computing platform, the only platform, literally the only one that is architecturally compatible across every single cloud from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars, to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who develops something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach, they like the universal reach, they like the acceleration, number one.\nThey like the ecosystem of programming tools, the ease of using it, and the fact that they have so many people they could reach out to to help them. There are millions of CUDA experts around the world, software all accelerated, tool all accelerated. Very importantly, they like the reach. They like the fact that you can see they could reach so many users after they develop the software.\nIt is the reason why we just keep attracting new applications. Finally, this is a very important point. Remember that the rate of CPU computing advance has slowed tremendously. Whereas back in the first 30 years of my career, it 10x in performance at about the same power every five years, and 10x every five years. That rate of continued advance has slowed at a time when people still have really, really urging applications that they would like to bring to the world. They can't afford to do that with the power keep going up. Everybody needs to be sustainable.\nYou can't continue to consume power. By accelerating it, we can decrease the amount of power you use for any workload. All of these multitude of reasons is really driving people to use accelerated computing, and we keep discovering new exciting applications.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nSenior Networking Equipment Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. Colette, I have a question on data center. You saw some weakness on build plans in the January quarter, but you're guiding to year-to-year acceleration in April and through the year. If you can just rank order for us, the confidence in the acceleration, is that based on your H100 ramp, generative AI sales coming through, or the new AI services model? Also, if you can talk about what you're seeing on the enterprise vertical.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. When we think about our growth, yes, we're going to grow sequentially in Q1 and do expect to over year growth in Q1 as well. We'll likely accelerate there going forward. What do we see as the drivers of that? Yes, we have multiple product cycles coming to market. We have H100 in market now. We are continuing with our networking launches as well that are sometimes fueled with our GPU computing with our networking.\nWe have Grace coming likely in the second half of the year. Additionally, generative AI, it's sparked interest definitely among our customers, whether those be CSPs, whether those be enterprises, whether those be startups. We expect that to be a part of our revenue growth this year.\nLet's just not forget that given the end of Moore's Law, there's an error here of focusing on AI, focusing on accelerated computing. As the economy improves, this is probably very important to the enterprises, and it can be fueled by the existence of cloud first for the enterprises as they open that up. I'm going to turn it to Jensen to see if he has any additional things he'd like to add.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nNo, I think you did great. That was great.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question today comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSenior Semiconductor Industry Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Jensen, you talked about this sort of million-times improvement in your ability to train these models over the last decade. Can you give us some insight into what that looks like in the next few years, and to the extent that some of your customers with these large language models are talking about 100x the complexity over that kind of timeframe? I know Hopper is 6x better transformer performance, but what can you do to scale that up? How much of that just reflects that it's going to be a much larger hardware expense down the road?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nFirst, I'll start backwards. I believe the number of AI infrastructures are going to grow all over the world. The reason for that is that AI, the production of intelligence, is going to be manufacturing. There was a time when people manufactured just physical goods. In the future, almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in.\nThat data center does exactly one thing and one thing only. It cranks on that data, and it produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or infrastructure cranks on it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value, that's called a factory. I expect to see AI factories all over the world. Some of it will be hosted in cloud, some of it will be on-prem.\nThere will be some that are large. There are some that will be mega large. There will be some that are smaller. I fully expect that to happen, number one. Number two, over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms, and new AI algorithms, and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x.\nThere are a lot of ways for us to do that. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA is not just a chip company, because the problem we're trying to solve is just too complex. You have to think across the entire stack, all the way from the chip, all the way to the data center, across the network, through the software.\nIn the mind of one single company, we can think across that entire stack. It's really quite a great playground for computer scientists for that reason, because we can innovate across that entire stack. My expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next coming, the AI platforms in the coming decade. Simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you. The accumulation of breakthroughs from transformers, large language models, and generative AI has elevated the capability and versatility of AI to a remarkable level. A new computing platform has emerged. New companies, new applications, and new solutions to long-standing challenges are being invented at an astounding rate. Enterprises in just about every industry are activating to apply generative AI to reimagine their products and businesses.\nThe level of activity around AI, which was already high, has accelerated significantly. This is the moment we've been working towards for over a decade. We are ready. Our Hopper AI supercomputer with the new transformer engine and Quantum InfiniBand fabric is in full production. CSPs are racing to open their Hopper cloud services. As we work to meet the strong demand for our GPUs, we look forward to accelerating growth through the year. Don't miss the upcoming GTC.\nWe have much to tell you about new chips, systems, and software, new CUDA applications and customers, new ecosystem partners, and a lot more on NVIDIA AI and Omniverse. This will be our best GTC yet. See you there.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to NVIDIA's third quarter earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. Thank you. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\n\nSimona Jankowski\n\nVP Investor Relations, NVIDIA\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially.\nFor a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results in business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the report that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, 16 November 2022, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially, and down 17% year-on-year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue, while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we worked through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions. Starting with data center, revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially, and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges, new export controls, and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year, growth was driven primarily by leading US cloud providers, and a broadening set of consumer internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems, and generative AI. As the number and scale of public cloud computing and internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows, our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases.\nWe will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries such as automotive and energy also contributed to growth, with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations, and analytics. During the quarter, the US government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H100-based products to China and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter. We started shipping our flagship H100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper architecture in Q3. H100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers, including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro.\nEarly next year, the first H100-based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. H100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks. H100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance. It offers 3x lower total cost of ownership while using 5x fewer server nodes and 3.5x less energy. Earlier today, we announced a multi-year collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI, including large state-of-the-art models. Microsoft Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens of thousands of A100 and H100 GPUs, Quantum-2 400 Gb per second InfiniBand networking, and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite to its platform.\nOracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure the full NVIDIA Accelerated Computing stack, and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H100. Cloud-based high-performance companies, Rescale is adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific community's rising demand for AI in the cloud. NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to Rescale's high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries. Networking posted strong growth, driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. Our new Quantum-2 40 Gb per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum.\nWe achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware, whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been re-architected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs. Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design pipeline is growing, and the number of infrastructure software partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks, and Red Hat. The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total, and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing. The number one most energy-efficient system is the Flatiron Institute's Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H100 GPUs.\nAt GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVX, reference designs featuring the new L40 GPU based on the ADA Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual worlds using NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. NVIDIA OVX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo, and Super Micro by early 2023. Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVX systems. We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and BioNeMo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adapt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, text summarization, chat box, code development, protein structure, and biomolecular property predictions.\nMoving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4. Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA, but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand. Our new ADA Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first ADA GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090, became available in mid-October amid tremendous demand and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the ADA family, RTX 4080, is available today.\nThe RTX 40 series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neural rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster gameplay. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics, and helped supercharge gaming. For example, the 15-year-old classic game Portal, now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3, has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed games. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350. There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on Steam just hit a record of 30 million, surpassing the prior peak of 28 million in January.\nActivision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales, topping the combined Box Office openings of movie blockbusters Top Gun: Maverick and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. This month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out in minutes, with 18,000 esports fans packed into the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. We continue to expand the GeForce Now cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400. We also launched GeForce Now on new gaming devices, including Logitech, CloudG, handheld cloud gaming Chromebooks, and Razer 5G Edge.\nMoving to ProViz. Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design, and engineering workloads. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers, and enterprise teams to design, publish, and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse Cloud Computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OVX for graphics and physics simulation, NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads, and the NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network, a global-scale distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge.\nLeaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse. Home improvement retailer Lowe's is using it to help design, build, and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company Heavy AI are creating Omniverse-powered digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. Deutsche Bahn, operator of Germany's National Railway, is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability. Moving to automotive. Rrevenue of $251 million increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers' core-based production ramps continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multi-billion-dollar platform. Volvo Cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform.\nThis is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both Drive Orin and Drive Xavier, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include Polestar, Auto, NIO, Polestar, and XPeng. At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA Drive Thor Superchip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC roadmap, delivers up to 2,000 teraflops of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace, Hopper, and ADA architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems simultaneously, offering a leap of performance while reducing cost and energy consumption. Drive Thor will be available for automakers' 2025 models, with Geely-owned automaker Zeekr as the first announced customer. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 53.6%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 56.1%.\nGross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges, largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth, salary increases, and higher data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nWe expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the H100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth, with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction. In automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Orin design wins. All in, we expect modest sequential growth, driven by automotive, gaming, and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, ±2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.2% and 66%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments.\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to 550 million. Further, financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse Conference in Phoenix on 30 November, the ERTE Virtual Tech Conference on 5 December, and the JPMorgan Forum on 5 January in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, 22 February. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please pull for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on the telephone keypad. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. Colette, I just wanted to clarify first. I think last quarter you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker, so I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming. Jensen, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. If, let's say, US Cloud CapEx is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center, and why?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYes. Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. We had indicated if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business. Now, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continued to challenge our overall China business, it was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid, and desktop a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia Pacific areas. We expect, though, stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nVivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general-purpose computing no longer scaling. Acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost-efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general-purpose computing slows. The second dynamic is AI, and we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AI, important breakthroughs in AI.\nOne is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to get the best content, or item, or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a cell phone or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request, and make the appropriate recommendation to them. The second has to do with large language models.\nThis started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to BERT, which led to GPT-3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language, it could be the language of biology, it could be the language of chemistry. Recently, I just saw a breakthrough called GenSLM, which is one of the first examples of learning the language of human genomes. The third has to do with generative AI. You know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI. The goal of perception, of course, is to understand context, but the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution, to create something, to generate product. This is now the beginning of the era of generative AI.\nYou probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images, generating videos, or generating text of all kinds. The ability to augment our performance, to enhance our performance, to make productivity enhanced, to reduce cost, and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever. You can see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency, and, of course, productivity. These things are more important than ever. My expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI for these reasons.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question.You started to bundle NVIDIA AI Enterprise now with the H100. I'm curious if you can talk about how we should think about timing around software modernization and how we should kind of see this growth of the model, particularly with a focus on the AI Enterprise and Omniverse side of things. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks, CJ. We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI Enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds. You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem, and over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and startups of all kinds. More than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly.\nThis quarter, we announced several initiatives, several partnerships, and collaborations. One that we announced today has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there. It has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many startups clamoring for large installations of our GPUs so that they could do large language model training and building their startups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's internet service providers. Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale flexibility of clouds. Over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud, all of our platform software stacks to the cloud.\nToday, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we can take a full stack out to the world's enterprise. That's all software included. A month ago, we announced a similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that Rescale, a leader in high-performance computing cloud, has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. MoNI has been integrated into GCP. We announced recently NEMO, large language model, and BioNEMO, large language model, to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. We also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full-stack software into the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly.\nCustomers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud. It's per GPU instance hour. If they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through a software license and so license and subscription. In both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it. The partners that we work with are super excited about it because NVIDIA's rich ecosystem is global. This could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. Our software stack is making really great progress.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n\nChris Caso\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nYes. Thank you. Good evening.I wonder if you could give some more color about the inventory charges you took in the quarter and then internal inventory in general. In the documentation, you talked about that being a portion of inventory on hand plus some purchase obligations. You also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. If you can clarify what was in those charges. In general, for your internal inventory, does that still need to be worked down? What are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks for the question, Chris. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter.\nMost of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. When we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down. Now, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market: our ADA architecture, our Hopper architecture, and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market, and that's what you see. We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for expected demand going forward. I think we've done a solid job, at least in this quarter, just based on that expectation going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Colette, I have two-part questions. First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that's sort of a modified version of the A100 with a lower data transfer rate. One could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it. I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge. Can you just go into that a little bit more? Last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought. Revenue came in pretty much in line, and it sounded like China was a net neutral. Is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charge is related to? Thanks.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nSure. Let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that. They're usually for very, very specific products and projects that we see. I'm going to answer no, nothing that we can see. Your second question regarding the inventory provisions. At the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We have always been looking at our needs long-term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand.\nThat's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. Now, looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China, it was time for us to take a hard look at what do we think we'll need for data center going forward. That led to our write-downs.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Research\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Colette, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials. It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues. You said gaming was resuming sequential growth, but then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto, gaming, and data center. How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance kind of flattish? Are they all just growing just a little bit, or is one of them actually down? How do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYes. Thanks, Stacy. Your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4. As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you're correct, it is only growing about $100 million. We've indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit. Our pro visualization business, we think, is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels to get to the right amounts. It's very difficult to say which will have that increase. Again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Lipacis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I think for you, you've articulated a vision for the data center where a solution with an integrated solution set of a CPU, GPU, and DPU is deployed for all workloads or most workloads, I think. Could you just give us a sense of or talk about where is this vision in the penetration cycle, and maybe talk about Grace's importance for realizing that vision? What will Grace deliver versus an off-the-shelf x86? Do you have a sense of where Grace will get embraced first or the fastest within that vision? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Mark. Grace's data moving capability is off the charts. Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory, by a factor of 10. That's not possible without special capabilities that are designed between Hopper and Grace, and the architecture of Grace. Grace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds. Those applications are related to, for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time. It's all hot. It all needs to be fast so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using your service. It is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning. Those kind of applications are really terrific.\nGrace, I think I've said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we're still on track to do that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years, near-term, as you guys pointed out. The team is driving strong NIC and BlueField-attached to your own compute solutions like DGX, and more partner announcements like VMware. We also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general-purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends. What's the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. If I could take that. First, thanks for the question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing. We don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our networking solutions are very high-end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data. If you have a hyperscale data center these days and you are deploying a large number of AI applications, it is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center. The small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings, frankly, in provisioning the service, or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics. These days, with disaggregated and AI application, AI provisioning in data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic, and it pays for itself right away.\nThat's where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services, and, well, the AI applications that we focus on. Now, you might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world, and it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 Gb per second network. The reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously. The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. In the places where we focus, networking is really quite important. It goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox.\nI think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. Now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. That kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking. It isn't indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend, but it is highly indexed to AI adoption.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further. When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meta is doing on the AI footprint that they're deploying. Jensen, can you help us understand where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to traditional data center switching? Maybe kind of build on that, how you're positioning Spectrum 4 in the market. Does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks, Aaron. The math is like this. If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%, the numbers are huge. When we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. We distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes, and it runs for a very long time. The importance of the network can't be overemphasized.\nThe difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very easy to achieve, is the difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself. A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge within the network itself. We achieve significant differences in overall efficiency. If you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure or even hundreds of millions of dollars on the infrastructure, the difference is really quite profound.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ambrose Fillmore with BMO. Your line is now open.\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Thank you very much. Actually, I had a couple of clarifications. Colette, on the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down tier with you in the reported quarter? The quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out, and again, you said it grew quarter over quarter. Is that a fair assumption? I had a clarification on the USG band. Initially, it was supposed to be $400 million really going to what the government was trying to firewall. Is the A800, I'm just trying to make sure I understand it. Isn't that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall high-performance compute? Or is A800 going to a different set of customers? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThank you for the question. Looking at our compute for the quarter, it's about flattish. Yes, we're seeing also growth in terms of our networking. You should look at our Q3 compute; it's about flattish for the last quarter.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nAmbrose, A800, the hardware of A800 ensures that it always meets US government's clear test for export control. It cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it. It is hardware limited. It is in the hardware that determines A800's capabilities, so it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit. We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute the introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time. The company did remarkable feats to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected. A800 hardware surely ensures that it always meets US government's clear test for export control.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor and Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. I'm hoping you can discuss the pace of H100 growth as we progress over the next year. We've gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there's quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product, and that there's supply available as well. Does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective, or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let's say, second half of 2023?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nH100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways. The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings, because every data center is now power limited, and because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I—and because of the pent-up demand for Hopper, because of these new models that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems, large language models, and generative AI models, customers are clamoring to ramp Hopper as quickly as possible. We are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers. Remember, NVIDIA is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It's a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years.\nIt's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. We're working hand in glove with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up Hoppers. We expect them to have Hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. We are expecting to ship some volume. We're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1. That's a faster transition than Ampere. It's because of the dynamics that I've described.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director, Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Cowen\n\nYeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business. I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you're thinking there and what sort of drove the decision. I guess the derivative of that, Jensen, that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently, I mean, what does that mean for the business? That it's just a reflection of where demand is and you're going to break things out differently, or is something changing about the mix of, I guess, internal properties versus vertical industry demand within the hyperscale customer base? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYes, Matt. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward in discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger, and our customers are complex.\nNow, when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about seven, eight different companies. The reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases, and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is, where our researchers, where our higher education is also purchasing. We're trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we're seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we're seeing in the hyperscales.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Let me double-click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are two major dynamics that's happening.\nFirst, the adoption of NVIDIA AI in internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot. Internet service companies. These are internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies. The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing. Almost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year, this quarter, the last quarter since GTC, about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud. A CSP, a hyperscaler, are two things to us, therefore. A hyperscaler can be a sell-to customer. They are also a sell-with partner.\nOn the public cloud side of their business, because of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem, because we have so many internet service customers, and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack, the public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us, and the sell-with relationship they have with us. It's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely, very likely, be the vast majority of their overall consumption. Because the world's CSPs, the world's public clouds, is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world, it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large.\nIncreasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will include, of course, continue to sell to them for internal consumption, but very importantly, sell-with for the public cloud side.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to, looking backward at the crypto impact, obviously, that's gone from your numbers now, but do you see any potential for liquidation of GPUs that are in the mining network, any impact going forward? And do you foresee blockchain being an important part of your business at some point down the road?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWe don't expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road. There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. The reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today is upgraded to a 4090, or a 3090 they bought a couple of years ago is upgraded to a 4090 today. That 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed if sold at the right price. The volume of the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. The inventory is never zero. When the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market.\nMy sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. Early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing it, that the ADA launch was a home run. The 4090, we shipped a large volume of 4090s because, as you know, we were prepared for it. Yet, within minutes, they were sold out around the world. The reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. That says something about the strength, the health, and the vibrancy of the gaming market. We're super enthusiastic about the ADA launch. We have many more ADA products to come.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I had two quick ones for Colette. On supply, I think there were some mixed messaging in your remarks. I think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point. When you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point. Secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic, I realize, but it is, I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million. It's becoming a bigger piece of your OpEx. Curious how we should be modeling that going forward. Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nSure. When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better. Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers there. Now, that's our supply. We've also made a discussion regarding our customers' supply constraints issues. When setting up a data center, even getting data center capacity has been very difficult. Therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. That hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply. In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees, but also once a year to our employees.\nIt's a single date in terms of when that is priced. It's difficult to determine. Stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be. We look at it from an overall compensation perspective. Up until now, and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, everyone. We are quickly adapting to the macro environment, correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China, and keeping our OpEx flat for the next few quarters. Our new platforms are off to a great start and form the foundation for our resumed growth.\nNVIDIA RTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI. The launch of ADA Lovelace is phenomenal. Gamers waited in long lines around the world, and 4090 stocks sold out quickly. Hopper, with its revolutionary transformer engine, is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models, and generative AI. NVIDIA Networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput, and enjoying record results. Orin is the world's first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics, and putting automotive on the road to be our next multi-billion-dollar platform. These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services. NVIDIA's pioneering work in accelerated computing is more vital than ever. Limited by business, general-purpose computing has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing.\nScaling through general-purpose computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint. Accelerated computing is the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one again. I would now like to turn the conference over to Simona Jankowski, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSimona Jankowski\n\nHead of Investor Relations, NVIDIA\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Q2 of Fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's investor relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially.\nFor a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, 24 August 2022, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially, and up 3% year-on-year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we indicated in our pre-announcement press release on 8 August 2022, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker gaming revenue. Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook. Starting with gaming, revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially, and down 33% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China.The decline in gaming GPU revenue was sharper than anticipated, driven by both lower units and lower ASPs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand.\nWe implemented programs with our gaming channel partners to adjust pricing in the channel, and to price-position current high-end desktop GPUs as we prepare for a new architecture launch. As noted last quarter, we had expected cryptocurrency mining to make a diminishing contribution to gaming demand. We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto mining contributed to the decline in gaming demand. While gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in gaming remain strong. NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics, and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam. Gaming has emerged from the pandemic as an even more popular form of entertainment and social connectivity.\nEstimated GeForce sell-through is up over 70% since before the pandemic, and peak concurrent users on Steam are also up more than 70% over the same time period. GeForce NOW registered members now exceed 20 million. This quarter, we added 80 more titles, including the hugely popular Genshin Impact, bringing our total to over 1,350. Moving to professional visualization, revenue of $496 million was down 20% sequentially and down 4% from a year ago. A sequential increase in mobile revenue was more than offset by lower desktop revenue, particularly at the high end. As macroeconomic headwinds intensified, enterprise demand slowed, and OEMs worked to reduce inventory. We expect these trends to persist in Q3. While ProViz is undergoing a near-term adjustment after doubling last year, we believe we have expanded the market opportunity over the last couple of years with AI and Omniverse workloads.\nWe believe hybrid work is here to stay, and with it, the need for collaborative 3D design enabled by professional graphic workstations, both at home and in the office, as well as in the cloud. In June, we announced a partnership with Siemens to enable the industrial metaverse and AI-powered digital twins, connecting Siemens' accelerator platform to NVIDIA Omniverse. This connection opens Siemens to the vast ecosystem of NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA to Siemens' ecosystem of the world's largest industries. Earlier this month at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, we announced advancements to several foundational technologies of the metaverse, defined as the 3D version of the internet. First, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will enable businesses to create and deploy assistants and avatars, transforming interactions across a range of industries.\nWe also unveiled 11 new Omniverse connectors, bringing the total number of connectors to the Omniverse USD ecosystem to 112. Finally, we released SDKs for the new field of neurographics, which intertwines AI and graphics to help automate the creation of virtual worlds. Moving to automotive, revenue of $220 million increased 59% sequentially and 45% from the year-ago quarter. Strong growth was driven by auto AI solutions, which include AI cockpits and self-driving revenue, with particular strength in self-driving as new energy vehicle design wins ramp into volume. We believe Q2 was an inflection point for our automotive revenue, as NVIDIA Orin has great momentum. During the quarter, we announced rollout plans of new vehicles from OEM partners: NIO, Li Auto, JiDu, and Human Horizons, as well as Pony.ai's line of self-driving trucks and robotaxis, all built on NVIDIA DRIVE.\nLooking forward, we expect our $11 billion automotive design win pipeline to translate to continued growth. Moving to data center, revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations, as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year-on-year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased, but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions. Vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year. Key workloads driving growth include natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous vehicle fleet data processing and training, and cloud graphics. Let me share a couple of customer examples. Pinterest transitioned to 100x larger recommender models by moving its imprint from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs.\nIts ability to deploy a higher quality model at high throughput and low latency resulted in a 16% increase in engagement, a critical metric for the company, which has over 400 million users and 300 billion images. Tesla recently upgraded its supercomputer to use over 7,000 A100 GPUs for autopilot training. From a product perspective, networking-led growth this quarter put strong demand from our high-speed Ethernet adapters and design win momentum toward next-generation adapters, including the ConnectX-6 and ConnectX-7. We also see growing interest from cloud service providers for our new Spectrum-4 400 Gb per second Ethernet networking platform. Additionally, we are ramping into the upcoming launches of our next-generation platforms. The Hopper architecture flagship H100 data center GPU is in production. Grace is our first CPU.\nTop computer makers, including Dell, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo, and Supermicro, are adopting the new NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip to build the next generation of supers. 71% of the systems on the latest Top500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA's own Selene supercomputer ranks at number eight in the Top500 and is the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA. Significant advances in software technology are key to our platform performance. In the past two years, our A100-based platform has delivered 6x more performance as measured by the MLPerf industry benchmark, largely through new software technologies and optimizations.\nLast month, we announced an update to the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework that can speed up the training of large language models by up to 30%. Improving a multi-hundred million dollar AI infrastructure by 30% translates to significant value for customers. LLMs are one of the most important neural networks today, ranging in size from tens of billions to over a trillion parameters. Learning from text, they can be used for real-time content generation, text summarization, customer service chatbots, and question answering for conversational AI interfaces. Currently, these capabilities are available to early access customers to run on NVIDIA DGX SuperPODs and NVIDIA DGX Foundry, as well as in Microsoft Azure Cloud, with other cloud platforms available soon. We are working with the industry leaders in large language models, a very active and exciting space of AI.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand, and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty. We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and down 32% sequentially, as Q1 included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially.\nThese increases were driven primarily by employee growth costs, as well as increases in salaries to support our employees during this high inflationary environment, and engineering development of new products coming to market. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term revenue growth while managing near-term profitability. Our full-year non-GAAP OpEx is expected to grow over 30%. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases. We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our operation through December 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the Q3 of fiscal 2023. We expect gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially, as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand, and prepare for our new product generation.\nWe expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in data center and automotive. Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion, ±2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, ±1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 to 600 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, and other information is available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.\nWe will be attending the Jeffries Conference in Chicago on 30 August and the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco on 12 September. We will be holding a financial analyst Q and A with management following Jensen's GTC keynote on 20 September. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our Q3 of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, 16 November. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you assist? Would you please hold for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director of Semiconductor and Semiconductor Equipment Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question.\nI think the question we all have is, what is normalized revenues for gaming for you guys? Obviously, this is a challenge for you as well. Curious how you're thinking about it today. Is the fiscal 2020 recovery post the first half 2019 correction an appropriate framework, or was that inflated by crypto as well? I guess as part of that, how do we think about the cascading in of the new product cycle? Is there potential for future reserves needed to be taken if gaming does not meet your new updated outlook? Thanks so much.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, let me start first there and see if I can assist in terms of how to think about after we get through our completion just now of Q2 and what we have provided here for guidance for Q3.\nAcross those two quarters, Q2 of 2023 and Q3 of 2023, we have likely undershift gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through, or essentially our end demand for those combined two quarters of Q2 and Q3, to be approximately $5 billion. Now, on top of this, keep in mind that we do have gaming growth drivers to consider for the future. These can include our new gaming product introductions that are around the corner, as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our gaming technology, to just name a couple. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that.\nNow, regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter, but what we need for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did of supply back more than a year ago when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products. This was an opportunity for us to resize, given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. Our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are. I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Colette.\nCJ, our sell-through is off the highs in the beginning of the year, but it's still very solid. In fact, sell-through has increased 70% since pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. It's very clear that the fundamentals of gaming are strong, and this medium is really doing well. Not to mention, the gaming platforms are being used. Our gaming PCs are being used for influencers, people sharing content, creating content, Vbloggers, VTubers. There's all kinds of new ways of engaging and spending time with video games. Our strategy is to reduce the sell-in, reduce the sell-in this quarter, next quarter, to let channel inventory correct. Obviously, we're off the highs, and the macro condition turns sharply worse. Our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory.\nWe've also instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products. Ampere is the most popular GPU we've ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. It remains the best GPUs in the world, and it will be very successful for some time. However, we do have exciting new next-generation coming, and it's going to be layered on top of that. We've done two things. We've reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct, and we've implemented programs with our partners to price position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation. All of this, we anticipate we're working towards a path to be in a good shape going into next year. Okay, so that's what our game plan is.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. Actually, I just wanted to clarify, Jensen, should we assume that gaming sell-in will kind of stay at these levels into your Q1 or Q2, or depending on new product launch, it might recover? Just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there. My question is actually similar on the data center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that data center CapEx could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors.\nI'm curious, what's your sense of utilization of your data center shipments, and what is the risk that there could be a correction in the data center given some of the macro caution expressed by some of the hyperscaler and enterprise customers?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Vivek. The sell-through, as I mentioned earlier, of GeForce is solid. The end market gaming demand is solid. It's off the highs, which was really high recently in the beginning of the year. We have, and because we were building for such a vibrant market, we found ourselves with excess inventory. Our strategy is to sell well below, well sell-in, well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct. We'll do that for a couple of quarters or so.\nWe believe that by the end of the year, we'll be in good shape going into next year. I hope that answers your question, but the important thing is our sell-in rate is far below what is happening in the market for sell-throughs. The sell-through is solid, has increased 70% since pre-COVID, and the gaming market is really quite vibrant. On the second question, on data center end markets, we hear fairly broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud. We hear quite broadly that demand for GPU rentals far exceeds current supply. It's fairly sensible to us, partly because the number of use cases for GPUs in the cloud has grown quite a bit.\nIf you look at one particular segment in just managing, collecting data, and managing the data of the AV fleet and using that data to train AI models, using that data to reconstruct HD maps, the usage of GPUs in the cloud for just that one application has grown a lot. Furthermore, the deep learning-based recommender systems have demonstrated such significant effectiveness, and it helps internet service providers to enhance engagement, enhance click-through rate. This particular form of recommender systems is going to really drive a fair amount of data processing and machine learning in the cloud. Over the last several years, a very important model has emerged called Transformers. You and I have spoken about this model several times in the past.\nIt's been found that this transformer model, this language model, which when scaled up in size, exhibits really spectacular and effective capabilities to be used to learn skills with either few shots or almost no shot, meaning it could learn skills, it could perform skills that it had never learned because the knowledge was somehow encoded from the large amount of data that it had learned from. This large language model area of innovation is used in, of course, conversational, chat, Q and A, summarization, text generation, image generation. Very importantly, it's being used in life sciences for understanding chemistry. We've done some very important work in this area ourselves called MegaMolBART, understanding proteins, understanding DNA to learn the language of these large, very, very large spatially as well as temporally or sequentially types of data.\nThe impact of this area is really quite worth staying close to. It's called large language models. I think Stanford did a paper that called it foundation models that could be used for training all kinds of other types of AIs. We're seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud. We were challenged this quarter with a fair amount of supply chain challenges because, as you know, we don't just sell the GPU chip, but these systems are really complex with a large number of chips in the system components that we offer, like HGX. All of the components have to come together for us to be able to deliver the final component. Furthermore, these data centers sit idle until the last piece comes together.\nThe last piece includes very complicated switches, very complicated NICs, networkings, and cables. Building these high-performance computing data centers at very large scale for the world's clouds is not particularly easy. The supply chain challenges have been somewhat disruptive, but the demand is there. On top of that, we're ramping into Hopper, which is really a fantastic generation.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsey with Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Semiconductor, Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the data center question that Vivek just asked from a couple of angles.\nI guess, Colette, the first angle being in the release, you guys talked about pulling, I don't know, high $200 million of revenue into the July quarter from October, but also with supply chain challenges, maybe some deliveries that were meant for July got pushed back into October. If you could talk a little bit more about those dynamics and just clarify for us that the October sequentially up data center guidance is actually clean of any pull-ins. Jensen, the second part, the moving pieces, networking stronger in data center, US hyperscale stronger, China hyperscale weaker. If you could kind of walk us through the trends that you're seeing into the October and January quarters, and in sort of those breakouts, and clarify for us when you think H100 will really start to drive revenue. Thanks.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question.\nIt's kind of a little bit of an add-on to some of the statements that Jensen was discussing regarding our supply chain and what we're seeing today. Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through. Our platforms, including HGX, networking chips, cables, and switches, were very important to the customers. It's not just about us selling the GPUs. Even though customers order components themselves, they're looking from us for what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers. We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability. Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time from a logistics and availability to get those things out.\nCustomers were impacted as well by availability of key third-party other components that we were not offering, which was slowing down some of their deployments. What we did in our Q2 orders that could not be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2. We worked with customers to optimize that supply and demand, and that is what we have just spoke to.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nLet me answer the questions about the North American and the China hyperscalers. The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in, well, they have been rather slow in building out and really slowed down in Q2. This slowdown cannot last forever.\nThe number of new technologies and software, the number of people who are using clouds, the number of cloud services is continuing to grow. I fully expect investment to return. They're a very important market for us, a very large market for us. The fact that North American hyperscalers doubled year over year our revenues at the North American hyperscalers, and that was offset by declines in China, it says something about the slowdown in China. I don't think that's going to last forever. I think it's going to return. With respect to Hopper, we're in full production now, and we're racing to get Hopper to all of the CSPs who are dying to get them. It goes with our HGXs, which is multiple Hoppers on a system tray. It's really a supercomputer and a motherboard, if you will.\nIt goes along with it, networking gear and switch gear. There's an enormous amount of resources applied from all of the CSPs around the world and ourselves to get Hopper to them. We expect to ship substantial Hoppers in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question regarding the $1.22 billion inventory charge, maybe for Colette on this one specifically. In the CFO commentary, I think you state that the inventory charge is related to weaker demand in both data center and gaming. I think the gaming side is pretty clear based on your comments so far. Curious what's changed on the data center side.\nIs it mostly the Chinese hyperscalers that Jensen just spoke to, or is there something else going on in terms of how you're thinking about demand in data center over the next couple of quarters? Related to this, curious if the delay in Sapphire Rapids at Intel is having an impact on your business in the near to medium term. Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks for the question. Our inventory charges, as we commented, we're taking a thorough look of not only this last quarter as well as the quarter that we're guiding, but looking over the long term of what we need for demand and then what we had in terms of supply. Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to drive the commitments of the supply that we already have.\nWhat is happening here for the data center, we had great high expectations. We still have very strong, solid growth projection for data center as well. We're going to take this opportunity for some of the prior architecture pieces to write down those given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward. You are correct. There are also pieces in there for gaming. We have written down some silicon and chips as the macroeconomic conditions, and we get ready for our future product launches taken into account. There's also components, services, and capacities, and some of the other drivers that are incorporated in those write-downs.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nOur Hopper supports previous generation GPUs, I guess next generation CPUs, Sapphire Rapids and [inaudible]after that, as well as Gravitons.\nWe certify and test across all of the CPUs because the cloud service providers demand it. They intend to deploy NVIDIA accelerators and NVIDIA Hoppers across a large number of CPUs. There is no question that the delay is disruptive, and a lot of engineers have to scramble. It would have been a lot easier if next generation CPUs were to have executed more perfectly. However, Hopper goes into an environment with CSPs where they connect our PCI Express connectors to old generation and current generation CPUs as well. Nobody likes the delay. The next generation CPUs will trigger a refresh of infrastructure and new servers, and I'm super excited about them. However, we're going to be able to go to market plenty fine with Hopper supporting existing infrastructure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of it's kind of been talked a little bit about. I just, Colette, I want to think about the numbers a little bit more. I guess based on the guidance commentary, where I would come up thinking about would be like a 30%+ sequential decline in gaming and professional visualization, and maybe kind of low to mid-single digit growth in data center and auto. I guess, is that the right context? With that, and with Hopper coming down the pipeline, we're going to have a lot of questions around kind of the deceleration of year-over-year growth in data center, I believe. Do you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal Q4, that you actually see data center growth re-accelerate as that product cycle materializes?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah.\nThanks for the question. That's a pretty good understanding of our guidance. We do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2. Of our two areas of decline, gaming and ProViz, that may be about three-quarters of it associated with gaming. Professional visualization would probably be about one quarter of the two areas that will decline. Our data center, yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We'll continue to look at it. There may be some more opportunity there. Automotive, very similar to our thoughts at the very beginning of the quarter, we are expecting continued growth through each of the quarters of this fiscal year. We felt that Q2 was an inflection point.\nWe'll continue to grow into Q3 and hopefully Q4 going forward. I'll turn it over to Jensen to see his thoughts in terms of Hopper, what Hopper brings to us in Q4, and expectations.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe first thing I'll say, Aaron, is that we are selling in, or we're selling far below the market demand, excuse me, far below the market sell-through. The reason for that is to allow the inventory, the channel inventory, and the OEM inventories to correct. This allows us to prepare for our next generation. Our next generation has Hopper for compute, but we also have a next generation for computer graphics that will be coming to market. Hopper is a giant new generation because it is designed to perform this new type of AI model called Transformers.\nIt has an engine inside it called Transformer Engine with numerical formats and pipelines that allows us to do a spectacular job on Transformer type of models, which includes large language models, but it also includes computer vision models that are now able to be processed with this new type of AI model called Transformers. I fully expect Hopper to be the next springboard for future growth. The importance of this new model, Transformers, can't possibly be understated and can't be overstated. This is the impact of this model across robotics, computer vision, languages, biology, chemistry, drug design. It's just really quite spectacular. I'm sure that you've been hearing about this new breakthrough in AI, and Hopper was designed for this.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nManaging Director and US Semiconductor Capital Equipment and Specialty Semiconductors Analyst, Citi\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question.\nColette, can you talk about networking versus compute? Were they both supply constrained in the July quarter, and are they both sequentially growing in the October quarter?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nWithin our Q2 results, we have been continuing to improve our supply for networking. We have a lot of important products that the CSP needs, many of our customers need, and we have been working to really improve that supply. We were able to set very strong growth in terms of networking, both sequentially and year-over-year. As we move into the next quarter, we're going to have to see which is going to be growth larger. We're just going to have to take a look once we finish that quarter. Our supply for compute is here.\nAs we've discussed, sometimes it's important that they have many of our other components that we provide in networking at the same time that we are providing the GPUs. Sometimes those are very important for us to deliver together. We always have to keep that in mind. It's not always a supply constraint, but there are certain parts of it that are.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to ask, why did the supply constraints hit you guys so hard this quarter? I mean, you've done such a great job the last couple of years outgrowing really everybody in a very challenging supply chain environment. It hasn't tripped you up at all.\nIt seems like now it's kind of hitting you fairly hard at a time when, in other cases, it's kind of easing. I'm just kind of curious, what is it about the timing, and how long does it sort of take? Is that a Hopper issue? Is it related to other components? As you talked about, how long does it take to clear those issues up? Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nLet me start and see if Jensen wants to add on to it. Our execution has absolutely been phenomenal. When we think about the challenges of we're almost putting together a full data center for our customers and getting it shipped out, we're no different in the same way that the CSPs are challenging with setting up their data centers, as we're such an integral part of that. Networking has been short of supply.\nThese are the same supply issues that some of our CSPs are having. Our supply arrived a little bit late in the quarter for some of our key products that we needed to get out. Putting that together caused some disruption in our logistics and distribution. We were pleased in terms of reaching the levels of networking that we did, but we did have some challenges this quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst of US Semiconductors, Bernstein\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to that data center inventory charge. You listed data center first when you talked, primarily related to data center and gaming. Can you give us a feeling for how much of that charge was data center versus gaming?\nTo follow up on that, it did sound like to me that it was mostly Ampere and not Hopper changing expectations. Can you verify that or clarify it and just talk about what's happened with your expectations for Hopper? Have they gone up or down, or has there been any change at all relevant to that inventory charge?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYes, Stacey. Regarding our inventory charges that we had, when you think about what we have in supply, whether it be chips, components, or memory, remember, a lot of these things can be used interchangeably across the two. Additionally, the value of our inventory for data center is much different than the value of what we have for gaming from an overall cost perspective. We're creating capacity opportunities, putting together all of those systems in terms of data center. It is prior architecture.\nAbsolutely, this is not a question regarding anything of our future products coming to market. Nothing on the inventory provisions has to do with that. We took this as looking at the macroeconomic conditions as we've discussed. Our expectations, our plans were higher, they're still quite solid that we see in demand, both for gaming, as well as solid for data center, and that will continue. We did have to just take a right-sizing of that inventory.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWas designed for Transformers. New Transformers was going to be important. Nobody could have predicted the profound importance of large language models. Large language models, excitement, innovation, ideas, companies, startups, industries, all exceeding everyone's expectations. I don't think anybody could have predicted the impact of Transformers as it scaled up to these giant sizes.\nThere's a fair amount of literature now written about language models that were small-ish in the old days in the beginning, several years ago, three years ago, and the ones that are in the hundreds of billions and moving towards probably several trillion parameters. The effectiveness of the AI is really quite spectacular. To have AI that was never trained on a particular skill and yet within one shot or one shot of trying or even no shots are able to perform that skill is beyond anybody's expectations, I would think. I think if the success of Hopper reflects the amount of work and pent-up demand for large training systems that Hopper is going to go into, that's an indicator. I think Hopper is going to be a spectacular success.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.\nYour line is open.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, SMBC Nikko\n\nThank you. I have a question on gross margins, Colette. The 65% non-GAAP number you're guiding to, does that include or assume any additional write-offs on the inventory front? Just to expand on that, your mix is probably a tailwind to gross margins given that gaming is down significantly, and that data center is up a little bit. I'm just wondering, are there any other offsets? I would have thought gross margins could actually be better than your longer-term model because of the mixed tailwinds. Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins outside of the inventory charges in Q2, as well as going into Q3, is really about our sales mix that we have. Probably also to understand that our sales mix in the next quarter for GPUs is not in the high end.\nThat has impacted our gross margins as we move into Q3. You're correct, we do expect that data center will assist in our gross margins, but we also have growth planned in auto. Auto is below our company average, and that will tend to offset some of those upper-bound things that we will see in terms of data center. From time to time, there's always a small amount of scraps that we will have in our gross margin estimates. Nothing material is planned, but there are small scraps that may occur from quarter to quarter that are included in our gross margins.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Colette, I had a clarification and then a question.\nMy clarification is whether October gross margins are benefiting at all from the sale of previously written down inventory. My question is whether you can give us the enterprise cloud split in data center because it sounds like the mix shifted more toward enterprise in July. I think investors might want to see that as risky in the face of enterprise clearly slowing. I'm wondering if you can give us that. Thanks.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nNo, there is nothing in our Q3 regarding those inventory provisions that we took in terms of earning that back in terms of our Q3. Regarding our split between our hyperscales and data centers and what we refer to as our vertical industries, they always tend to be about the same, 50% for one, 50% for the others. They're still in about that range.\nWe had discussed that our China hyperscales did not drive growth sequentially here. That did influence the hyperscales. Still, we are approximately in that 50/50%.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the weakness in ProViz, this is an enterprise-focused business, right? Granted, it's a somewhat narrow vertical market, but it does sort of play into the market concerns that consumer is weak now. Enterprise is the next shoe to drop. Is the decline in ProViz attributed to enterprise spending weakness, or is it some other dynamic? Why or why not is this not a leading indicator for your enterprise and vertical industry segments within your data center business?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nOur ProVisualization business, just in such a short time, they were in short supply and really trying to feed so much of the industry's desire to both refresh and attract it to the new RTX workstations that were there. We were fueling both mobile, as well as desktops, for that market and growing quite nicely. Remember, all of last year doubled the size of ProViz in one year. Right now, the OEMs are concentrating on their levels of inventory. Want to make sure that they can get through that inventory. Keep in mind, very similar to our discussion on gaming, there is still solid demand. There is still solid demand. We just have to correct some of the inventory, but we still see both the opportunities that we've created for the market for these to be long-standing. Your second question, remind me again.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nWhether the broader enterprise market is going to be, the verticals are going to be affected by that. I would say, first of all, we don't know. Second of all, unlike our workstation business, our ProViz business, there's no install base. Most of the ProViz sales tend to be upgrades or replacements from something that has our install base of three or four or five years that people, whatever upgrade cycle they happen to have. In the case of ProViz, the companies that are buying ProViz or ProViz systems likely already have systems that they've been using. If they were to tighten up ProViz for whatever reason, the people could continue to use what they have. In the case of our AI business, there's no real install base. These are all brand new things that people are growing into.\nThe productivity benefits or the cost savings benefits of using autonomous systems is fairly profound. It's not so much that the demand isn't out there. Everybody would like to be more productive, everybody would like to save more money, everybody would like to move faster. It's just that AI's understanding and AI's use is still spreading. We're delighted by the rate of growth and the rate of adoption of enterprise. My sense is that our AI business and our ProViz business have very different characteristics for that reason. What Colette said earlier about our ProViz business this last quarter is absolutely true, which is OEMs realizing that the end market is slowing and taking the opportunity to correct their inventory.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys.\nThanks for letting me ask a question. I just had a longer-term question about once your gaming business normalizes, with the absence of crypto in a general sense and with the merge coming, how do you view the pricing environment? I know you guys really weren't raising prices like we saw in the MSRP premiums in the aftermarket, but generally, your mix was quite rich over the last year or two. You're going to have Lovelace coming in. That'll obviously help the mix sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. How do you think about it normalizing if that $2.5 billion per quarter sell-through rate comes? Is the ASP mix across your stack about the same, or does it go down because of the absence of that crypto tightening dynamic?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nI would say that without crypto dynamic, the mix would go down.\nHowever, the overall trend long-term, the ASP is drifting up. The way to think about that is a game console. My first game console was $99. Lately, game consoles are selling for about $599. The reason for that is because it's more useful than ever. You use your game console for your greatest form of entertainment, and you use it for a very, very long time. GeForce essentially is a game console inside your PC. We've always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift towards the average selling price of a game console, so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so, roughly, at this time. We also have GeForce in the cloud. Because GeForce in the cloud is hosting many gamers simultaneously, it tends to want to be a much more powerful GeForce.\nOur cloud gaming GeForce tends to be our cloud gaming graphics, tends to be a much higher end. Of course, there's a design aspect of it. Most designers and most creators are able to use GeForce these days, and they use their PC to create content. Much of that content goes into video games and/or they're using video games to create their artistic content. The GeForce is not just for gaming for them. The GeForce is essentially their creative workstation as well. There are several dynamics that are causing the ASP of GeForce to go up, and we've been seeing this trend for several years now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, everyone. Navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment.\nIn gaming, our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still, the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We'll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month. In data center, AI, where computers are helping us write software that was impossible before, is driving a computing revolution and transforming every industry. NVIDIA's leadership in full-stack data center scale accelerated computing has made us the ideal partner for companies racing to leverage the power of AI. Even with the current macroeconomic headwinds, demand for our data center products has never been stronger. The next wave of computing is coming. With AI and 3D graphics advances, developers will extend the internet with virtual world overlays that connect to the physical world.\nThis next evolution of the internet is called Metaverse. We created Omniverse to connect the digital and physical world, and be an open platform for creating and operating Metaverse applications. The immediate applications for Omniverse span product design, manufacturing, and operations. Omniverse is off to a great start. Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business. Autonomous driving is one of the biggest challenges AI can solve, and computing opportunity for us spans the data center to the car. Autonomous driving will transform the auto industry into a tech industry. Automotive is one of the first to transform into a software-defined tech industry. All industries will be. We're building NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to be the engines for the world's enterprise to become software-defined, AI-powered technology companies.\nI look forward to next month's GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming, AI's continuing breakthroughs, and building the Metaverse, the next evolution of the internet. Join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis con`cludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the reports that we may file on form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, 25 May 2022, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. We delivered a strong quarter, driven by record revenue in both data center and gaming, with strong fundamentals and execution against a challenging macro backdrop. Total revenue of $8.3 billion was a record, up 8% sequentially, and up 46% year on year. Data center has become our largest market platform, and we see continued strong momentum going forward. Starting with gaming, revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year on year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 series has been our best gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously, with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past two years, according to Newzoo.\nNVIDIA RTX has set a new standard for the industry, with demand from both first-time GPU buyers, as well as those upgrading their PCs to experience the 250-plus RTX-optimized games and apps, double from last year. We estimate that almost 1/3 of the GeForce gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX. RTX has brought tremendous energy into the gaming world and has helped drive a sustained expansion in our higher-end platforms and installed base, with significant runway still ahead. Overall, end demand remained solid, though mixed by region. End demand in America remained strong. However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in Ukraine, and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. We expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year. We are projecting gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2.\nChannel inventory has nearly normalized, and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision. The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward. Laptop gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 series lineup. With this year's spring refresh, and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 series GPUs and energy-efficient, thin, and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year. Driving this growth are not just gamers, but also the fast-growing category of content creators, for whom we offer dedicated NVIDIA Studio drivers.\nWe've also developed applications and tools to empower artists, from Omniverse for advanced 3D and collaboration, to Broadcast for live streaming, to Canvas for painting landscapes with AI. The creator economy is estimated at $100 billion and powered by 80 million individual creators and broadcasters. We continued to build out our GeForce Now cloud gaming service. Gamers can now access RTX 3080 class streaming, our new top-tier offering with subscription plans of $19.99 a month. We added over 100 games to the GeForce Now library, bringing the total to over 1,300 games. Last week, we launched Fortnite on GeForce Now with touch controls for mobile devices, streaming through the Safari web browser on iOS and the GeForce Now Android app. Moving to pro visualization, Q1 revenue was $622 million, down sequentially 3%, and up 67% from a year ago.\nDemand remained strong as enterprises continued to build out their employees' remote office infrastructure to support hybrid work. Sequential growth in the mobile workstation GPUs was offset by lower desktop revenue. Strong year-on-year growth was supported by the NVIDIA RTX Ampere architecture product cycle. Top use cases include digital content creation at customers such as Sony Pictures Animation, and medical imaging at customers such as Medtronic. In just its second quarter of general availability, our Omniverse enterprise software is being adopted by some of the world's largest companies. Amazon is using Omniverse to create digital twins to better optimize warehouse design and flow, and to train more intelligent robots. Kroger is using Omniverse to optimize store efficiency with digital twin store simulation. PepsiCo is using Omniverse digital twins to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of its supply chain.\nOmniverse is also expanding our GPU sales pipeline, driving higher-end and multiple GPU configurations. The Omniverse ecosystem continues to rapidly expand, with third-party developers in the robotics, industrial automation, 3D design, and rendering ecosystems developing connections to Omniverse. Moving to automotive, Q1 revenue of $138 million increased 10% sequentially and declined 10% from the year-ago quarter. Our Drive Orin SoC is now in production and kicks off a major product cycle, with auto customers ramping in Q2 and beyond. Orin has great traction in the marketplace, with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers, and robotaxi companies. In Q1, BYD, China's largest EV maker, and Lucid, an award-winning EV pioneer, were the latest to announce that they are building their next generation fleets on Drive Orin. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $11 billion over the next six years, up from $8 billion just a year ago.\nMoving to data center, record revenue of $3.8 billion grew 15% sequentially and accelerated to 83% growth year-on-year. Revenue from hyperscale and cloud computing customers more than doubled year-on-year, driven by strong demand for both external and internal workloads. Customers remained supply-constrained in their infrastructure needs and continued to add capacity as they tried to keep pace with demand. Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include consumer internet companies, financial services, and telecom. Overall, data center growth was driven primarily by strong adoption of our A100 GPU for both training and inference, with large volume deployments by hyperscale customers and broadening adoption across the vertical industries. Top workloads include recommender systems, conversational AI, large language models, and cloud graphics. Networking revenue accelerated on strong, broad-based demand for our next generation 25, 50, and 100 Gb Ethernet adapters.\nCustomers are choosing NVIDIA's networking products for their leading performance and robust software functionality. In addition, networking revenue is benefiting from growing demand for DGX SuperPods and cross-selling opportunities. Customers are increasingly combining our compute and networking products to build what are essentially modern AI factories, with data as the raw material input and intelligence as the output. Our networking products are still supply-constrained, though we expect continued improvement throughout the rest of the year. One of the biggest workloads driving adoption of NVIDIA AI is natural language processing, which has been revolutionized by transformer-based models. Recent industry breakthroughs traced to transformers include large language models like GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron BART for drug discovery, and DeepMind AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Transformers allow self-supervised learning without the need for human-labeled data. They enable unprecedented levels of accuracy for tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and answering questions.\nTo do that, transformers use enormous training data sets and very large neural networks well into the hundreds of billions of parameters. To run these giant models without sacrificing low inference times, customers like Microsoft are increasingly deploying NVIDIA AI, including our NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and full software stack. In addition, we are seeing a rising wave of customer innovation using large language models that is driven by increased demand for NVIDIA AI and GPU instances in the cloud. At GTC, we announced our next-generation data center GPU, the H100, based on the new Hopper architecture. Packed with 80 billion transistors, H100 is the world's largest, most powerful accelerator, offering an order of magnitude leap in performance over the A100. We believe H100 is hitting the market at the perfect time.\nH100 is ideal for advancing large language models and deep recommender systems, the two largest scale AI workloads today. We are working with leading server makers and hyperscale customers to qualify and ramp H100. It, as well as the new DGX H100 AI supercomputing system, will ramp in volume late in the calendar year. Building on the H100 product cycle, we are on track to launch our first-ever data center CPU, Grace, in the first half of 2023. Grace is the ideal CPU for AI factories. This week at Computex, we announced that dozens of server models based on Grace will be brought to market by the first wave of system builders, including ASUS, Foxconn, Gigabyte, QCT, Supermicro, and Wiwynn.\nThese servers will be powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which features two CPUs, and the Grace Hopper Superchip, which pairs an NVIDIA Hopper GPU with an NVIDIA Grace CPU in an integrated model. We've introduced new reference designs based on Grace for the massive new workloads of next-generation data centers: CGX for cloud graphics and gaming, OVX for digital twins or Omniverse, and HGX for HPC and AI. These server designs are all optimized for NVIDIA's rich, accelerated computing software stacks, and can be qualified as part of our NVIDIA Certified Systems lineup. The enabler for the Grace Hopper and Grace Superchips is our ultra-energy-efficient, low-latency, high-speed, memory-coherent interconnect called NVLink, which scales from die to die, chip to chip, and system to system. With NVLink, we can configure Grace and Hopper to address a broad range of workloads.\nFuture NVIDIA chips, the CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, NICs, and SoCs will integrate NVLink just like Grace and Hopper, based on our world-class CerDes technology. We are making NVLink open to customers and partners to implement custom chips that connect to NVIDIA's platforms. In networking, we're kicking off a major product cycle with the introduction of Spectrum 4, the world's first 400 gigabit per second end-to-end Ethernet networking platform, including the Spectrum 4 switch, ConnectX 7 SmartNIC, BlueField-3 DPU, and the DOCA software. Built for AI, NVIDIA Spectrum 4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security, and powerful features to enable high-performance, advanced virtualization, and simulation at scale. Across our businesses, we are launching multiple new GPU, CPU, DPU, and SoC products over the coming quarters, with a ramp in supply to support the customer demand.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 65.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 67.1%, up 90 basis points from a year ago, and up 10 basis points sequentially. We have been able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures. We expect to maintain gross margins at current levels in Q2. Going forward, as new products ramp and software becomes a larger percent of revenue, we have opportunities to increase gross margins longer term. GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, impacted by a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the ARM transaction. Non-GAAP operating margin was 47.7%. We are closely managing our operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities, and we've been very successful in hiring so far this year, and are now slowing to integrate these new employees.\nThis also enables us to focus our budget on taking care of our existing employees as inflation persists. We are still on track to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses in the high 20% range this year. We expect sequential increases to level off after Q2, as the first half of the year includes a significant amount of expenses related to the bring-up of multiple new products, which should not reoccur in the second half. During Q1, we repurchased $2 billion of our stock. Our board of directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our outlook assumes an estimated impact of approximately $500 million relating to Russia and China COVID lockdowns.\nWe estimate the impact of lower sell-through in Russia and China to affect our Q2 gaming sell-in by $400 million. Furthermore, we estimate the absence of sales to Russia to have a $100 million impact on Q2 in data center. We expect strong sequential growth in data center and automotive to be more than an offset by the sequential decline in gaming. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, ±2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.1% and 67.1%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.75 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be in expense of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments.\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 12.5%, ±1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million-$450 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the BofA Securities Technology Conference in person on 7 June, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, 24 August 2022. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please hold for questions? Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad.\nWe ask that you please limit yourself to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess we'd love to get an update on how you're thinking about the gaming cycle from here. The business has essentially doubled over the last two years, and now we've got some crosswinds with crypto falling off, channel potentially clearing ahead of a new product cycle. You've talked about macro challenges, but at the same time, only 1/3 of the installed base has RTX, and we're moving out from under supply. We'd love to hear your thoughts from here once we get beyond kind of the challenges around COVID lockdown in the July quarter, how you're thinking about gaming trends.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, CJ, thanks for the question. You captured a lot of the dynamics well in your question. The underlying dynamics of the gaming industry is really solid. Net of the situation with COVID lockdown in China and Russia, the rest of the market is fairly robust, and we expect the gaming dynamics to be intact. The several things that are driving the gaming industry, in the last two years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously, and the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer as a platform for themselves, use it for broadcast. So many people are now using their home PCs as their second workstation, if you will, second studio, because they're also working from home. It is our primary way of communicating these days.\nThe need for GeForce PCs has never been greater. I think that the fundamental dynamics are really good. As we look into the second half of the year, it's hard to predict exactly when COVID and the war in Russia is going to be behind us. Nonetheless, the governing dynamics of the gaming industry is great.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Matt Ramsey with Cowen. Your line's open.\n\nMatt Ramsey\n\nManaging Director and Semiconductors Research Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I wanted to ask a bit of a question on the data center business. In this upcoming cycle with H100, there's some IO upgrades that are happening in servers that I think are going to be a fairly strong driver for you in addition to what's going on with Hopper and the huge performance leaps that are there.\nI wanted to ask a longer-term question, though, around your move to NVLink with Grace and Hopper and what's going on with your whole portfolio. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven, attached to third-party servers, or do you think revenue shifts dramatically or, in a small way, over time to be more sort of vertically integrated, all of the chips together on NVLink? How is the industry sort of responding to that potential move? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, I appreciate the question. Let's see. The first point that you made is a very big point. The next generation of servers that are being teed up right now are all Gen 5. The IO performance is substantially higher than what was available before. You're going to see a pretty large refresh as a result of that.\nBrand new networking cards from our company and others, Gen 5, of course, drives new platform refresh. We're perfectly timed to ramp into the Gen 5 generation with Hopper. There are a lot of different system configurations you want to make. If you take a step back and look at the type of systems that are necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and training, inference done in the cloud for hyperscale nature, done on-prem for enterprise computing, done at the edge, each one of these workloads and deployment locations, the way that you manage would dictate a different system architecture. There isn't one size that fits all, which is one of the reasons why it's so terrific that we support PCI Express, that we innovated chip-to-chip interconnect before anybody else did. This is now some seven years ago.\nWe're in our 4th generation of NVLink that allows us to connect two chips next to each other, two dies, two chips, two modules, two SXM modules, to two systems, to multiple systems. Our coherent chip-to-chip link, NVLink, has made it possible for us to mix and match chips, dies, packages, systems, in all of these different types of configurations. I think that over time, you're going to see even more types of configurations. The reason for that has to do with a couple of very important new types of data centers that are emerging. You're starting to see that now with fairly large installation infrastructures with NVIDIA HPC and NVIDIA AI. These are really AI factories where you're processing the data, refining the data, and turning that data into intelligence. These AI factories are essentially running one major workload, and they're running it 24/7.\nDeep recommender systems is a good example of that. In the future, you're going to see large language models essentially becoming a platform themselves that would be running 24/7, hosting a whole bunch of applications. On the other end, you're seeing data centers at the edge that are going to be robotics or autonomous data centers that are running 24/7. They are going to be running in factories, retail stores, and warehouses, logistic warehouses all over the world. These two new types of data centers are just emerging, and they also have different architectures.\nI think the net of it all is that our ability to support every single workload, because we have a universal accelerator running every single workload from data processing to data analytics to high-performance computing to training to inference, that we can support ARM and x86, that we support PCI Express to multi-system NVLink, to multi-chip NVLink, to multi-die NVLink. That capability for us makes it possible for us to really be able to serve all of these different segments. With respect to vertical integration, I think that system integration, the better way to maybe say that is that system integration is going to come in all kinds of different ways. We're going to do semi-custom chips as we've done with many companies in the past, including Nintendo. We'll do semi-custom chiplets as we do with NVLink.\nNVLink is open to our partners, and they could bring it to any fab and connect it coherently into our chip. We could do multi-module packages. We could do multi-package systems. There are a lot of different ways to do system integration.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the sequential. Colette, I know you said the $500 million was a $400 million hit to gaming and a $100 million hit to data center. I'm assuming that that doesn't mean that gaming is down $400 million. I mean, do you see gaming actually down more than the actual Russia and lockdown hit? I guess just how do I think about the relative sequentials of the businesses in light of those constraints that you guys are facing?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nSure.\nLet me start first with what does that mean to gaming? What does that mean to gaming for Q2? We do expect gaming to decline into Q2. We still believe our end demand remains very strong. Ampere has just been a great architecture, and there's many areas where we continue to see strength and growth in both our sell-through, and probably what we will see added into that channel as well. In total, Q2 gaming will decline from last quarter, from Q1, that it will probably decline in the teens as we try and work through some of these lockdowns in China, which are holding us up. Overall, the demand for gaming is still strong. We still expect end demand to grow year over year in Q2.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line's open.\n\nMark Lipacis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question.\nIf you listen to the networking OEMs this earnings season, it seems that there was a lot of talk about increased spending by enterprises on their data centers, and sometimes you hear them talking about how this is being driven by AI. You talked about your year-to-year growth in your cloud versus enterprise spending. I wonder if you could talk about what you were seeing sequentially. Are you seeing a sequential inflection in the enterprise? Can you talk about the attach rate of software for enterprise versus data centers? Which software are you seeing the most interest? I know you talked about, is it Omniverse? Is it natural language processing? Or is there one big driver, or is it a bunch of drivers for the various different software packages you have?Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Mark. We had a record data center business this last quarter.\nWe expect to have another record quarter this quarter, and we're fairly enthusiastic about the second half. AI and data-driven machine learning techniques for writing software and extracting insight from the vast amount of data that companies have is incredibly strategic to all the companies that we know. Because in the final analysis, AI is about automation of intelligence, and most companies are about domain-specific intelligence. We want to produce intelligence. There are several techniques now that have been created to make it possible for most companies to apply their data to extract insight and to automate a lot of the predictive things that they have to do and do it quickly. I think the trend that you hear other people experiencing about machine learning, data analytics, data-driven insights, artificial intelligence, however it's described, is all exactly the same thing.\nIt's sweeping just about every industry and every company. Our networking business is also highly supply constrained. Our demand is really, really high. It requires a lot of components aside from just our chips, components, transceivers, connectors, and cables. It's a complicated system, the network, and there are many physical components. The supply chain has been problematic. We're doing our best, and our supply has been increasing from Q4-Q1. We're expecting it to increase in Q2, and increase in Q3 and Q4. We're really, really grateful for the support from the component industry around us, and we'll be able to increase that. With respect to software, there are two—well, first of all, there are all kinds of machine learning models: computer vision, speech AI, natural language understanding, all kinds of robotics applications.\nThe most, probably the largest, the most visible one is self-driving cars, which is essentially a robotic AI. Recently, this incredible breakthrough from an AI model called Transformers has led to really, really significant advances in natural language understanding. There are all these different types of models. There are thousands and thousands of species of AI models in all these different industries. One of my favorites—I'll just say it very quickly, and I'll answer the question about the software. One of my favorites is using Transformers to understand the language of chemistry, or using Transformers and using AI models to understand the language of proteins, amino acids, which is genomics. To apply AI to understand, to recognize the patterns, to understand the sequence, and essentially understand the language of chemistry and biology is a really, really important breakthrough.\nAll of this excitement around synthetic biology, much of it stems back to some of these inventions. Anyhow, all of these different models need an engine to run on. That engine is called NVIDIA AI. In the case of hyperscalers, they can cobble together a lot of open source, and we provide a lot of our source to them and a lot of our engines to them for them to operate their AI. For enterprises, they need someone to package it together and be able to support it and refresh it, update it for new architectures, support old architectures in their installed base, etc., and all the different use cases that they have. That engine is called NVIDIA AI. It's almost like a SQL engine, if you will, except this is an engine for artificial intelligence.\nThere's another engine that we provide, and that engine is called Omniverse, and it's designed for the next wave of AI, where artificial intelligence has to not just manipulate information like recommender systems, conversational systems, and such, but it has to interact with physical systems. Whether it's interacting with physics directly, meaning robotics, or being able to automate physical systems like heat recovery steam generators, which is really important today. Omniverse is designed to be able to sit at that interface, that intersection between simulation and artificial intelligence, and that's what Omniverse is about. Omniverse has now, let's see, we're still early in the deployment of Omniverse for commercial license. It's been a couple of quarters now since we've released Omniverse Enterprise.\nI think at this point, we have 10% of the world's top 100 companies that are already customers, licensing customers, substantially more who are evaluating. I think it's been downloaded nearly 200,000 times. It is being tried in some 700 companies. Colette highlighted some of the companies. You might see some of the companies that are using it in all kinds of interesting applications at GTC. I fully expect that the NVIDIA AI engine, the Omniverse engine, are going to be very successful for us in the future and contribute greatly to our earnings.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line's open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThanks. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if your Q2 outlook includes any stocking benefits from the new products that you are planning to launch this year. Jensen, my question is for you.\nYou're still guiding data center to a very strong, I think close to 70% or so year-on-year growth despite all the headwinds. Are you worried at all about all the headlines about the slowdown in the macroeconomy? Is there any cyclical impact on data center growth that we should keep in mind as we think about the second half of the year?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Let me first answer the question that you asked regarding any new products as we look at Q2. As we discuss about it, most of the ramp that we have of our new architectures, we're going to see in the back half of the year. We're going to start to see, for example, Hopper will probably be here in Q3, but starting to ramp closer to the end of the calendar year.\nYou should think about most of our product launches to be ramping in the second half of the year on that part. I'll turn it over for Jensen for the rest.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks. Our data center demand is strong and remains strong. Hyperscale and cloud computing revenues, as you mentioned, have grown significantly, have doubled year over year. We're seeing really strong adoption of A100. A100 is really quite special and unique in the world of accelerators. This is one of the really, really great innovations as we extended our GPU from graphics to CUDA to Tensor Cores GPUs. It's now a universal accelerator, so you could use it for data processing, for ETL, for example, extract, transform, and load. You could use it for database acceleration. Many SQL functions are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs.\nWe accelerate RAPIDS, which is the Python version, data center scale version of Pandas. We accelerate Spark 3.0. From database queries to data processing to extraction, transform, and loading of data before you do training and inference, whatever image processing or other algorithmic processing you need to do can be fully accelerated on A100. We're seeing great success there. At the core, and closer to what is happening today, you're seeing several different very important new AI models that are being invested in at very, very large scale and with great urgency. You probably have heard about deep recommender systems. This is the economic engine, the information filtering engine of the internet.\nIf not for the recommender system, it would be practically impossible for us to enjoy our internet experience, shopping experience, with trillions of things that are changing in the world every day, constantly, and be able to use your three-inch phone to even engage the internet. All of that magic is made possible by this incredible thing called a recommender system. The second thing is conversational AI. You're seeing chatbots and website customer service, even live customer service, being now supported by AI. Conversational AI has an opportunity to enhance the customer service on the one hand, and, on the other hand, supplement for a lot of labor shortage. The third is this groundbreaking piece of work that's related to Transformers that led to natural language understanding breakthrough.\nWithin it is this incredible thing called large language models, which embeds human knowledge because it's been trained in so much data. We recently announced Megatron 530B, and it was a collaboration we did with Microsoft, the foundation of, I think they call it Turing. This language model and others like it, like OpenAI's GPT-3, are really transformative, and they take an enormous amount of computation. However, the net result is a pre-trained model that is really quite remarkable. We're working with thousands of startups, large companies that are building who are using the public cloud, so it's driving a lot of demand for us in the public cloud. I think we have now 10,000 AI inception startups that are working with us and using NVIDIA AI.\nWhether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it saves money because the computation time is significantly reduced, the quality of service is a lot better, and they could do greater things. That's driving AI in the cloud. All of these different factors, whether it's just the industrial recognition of the importance of AI, the transformative nature of these new AI models, recommender systems, large language models, conversational AI, the thousands of companies around the world that are using NVIDIA AI in the cloud, driving public cloud demand, all of these things are driving our data center growth. We expect to see data center demand remain strong.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line's open.\n\nTim Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you very much. I had a question about this $500 million impact for July and whether it's more supply-related or demand-related.\nThat's because most others in semis are sort of citing this China stuff in particular as more of a logistics issue, so more of a supply issue. The language, Colette, you were using in your commentary cited lower sell-through in gaming and sort of the absence of sales in Russia. To me, that sounds a little more demand, which would make sense in the context of this new freeze on hiring that you have. I ask because if it's supply-related, then you could argue that it's not perishable and really just timing. If demand-related, that might never come back, and it could be the beginning of a falling knife. I wonder if you can sort of walk through that for me. Thanks.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nWell, thanks, Tim, for the question. Let me try a bet here on the China and Russia, two very different things.\nThe current China lockdowns that we are seeing, interestingly, have implications to both supply and demand. We have seen challenges in terms of the logistics throughout the country, things going in and out of the country. It puts a lot of pressure on just logistics that were already under pressure. From a demand perspective, it has also been hit from the gaming side. You have very large cities that are in full lockdown, focusing really on other important things for the citizens there. It's impacting our demand. We do believe that they will come out of COVID, and the demand for our products will come back. We do believe that will occur. The supply will sort itself. It's very difficult to determine how. In the case of Russia, we're not selling to Russia. That's something that we had announced earlier last quarter.\nThere were plans, and Russia has been a part of our overall company revenue, probably about 2% of our company revenue historically, and a little larger percentage when you look at our gaming business. Hope that helps.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nSenior Research Analyst, BMO\n\nHi. Thank you very much, Colette and Jensen. I actually really appreciate it that you call our demand for most chip companies. It seems like it's heresy to say demand is a problem, so refreshing to hear that. I had a question on the second half and relates to both data center as well as gaming. Last couple of times you have talked publicly, you have made comments that your visibility into the data center has never been better. I was wondering if you just take out the Russia impact, is that still true?\nAll the orders that you have been getting, they're intact, and you did say that business will see a strong momentum. I just wanted to make sure that statement of confidence you have made stays. On gaming, Colette, do we expect second half to be up year over year just based on the guide for second quarter? It seems like it could be up sequentially, but may not return to year-over-year growth in Q3. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Ambrish, thanks for the question. On first principles, it should be the case that our visibility of data centers is vastly better, vastly better than a couple of years ago. The reason for that is several. One, if you recall, a couple of two, three years ago, deep learning and AI was starting to accelerate in the most computer science deep companies in the world with CSPs and hyperscalers.\nJust about everywhere else, it was still quite nascent. There was a couple of reasons for that. Obviously, the understanding of the technology is not as pervasive at the time. The type of industrial use cases for artificial intelligence requires labeling of data that's really quite difficult. Now, with Transformers, you have unsupervised learning and other techniques, zero-shot learning that allows us to do all kinds of interesting things without having to have human-labeled data. We even have synthetic generated data with Omniverse that helps customers do data generation without having to label data, which is either too costly or, quite frankly, oftentimes impossible. Now the knowledge and the technology has evolved to a place that most of the industries could use artificial intelligence in a fairly effective way, and in many industries, rather transformative.\nI think, number one, we went from clouds as hyperscalers to all of industry. Second, we went from training-focused to inference. Most people thought that inference was going to be easy. It turns out inference is by far the harder. The reason for that is because there are so many different models, and there are so many different use cases, and so many quality of service requirements. You want to run these inference models in as small of a footprint as you can. When you scale out, the number of users that use the service is really quite high. Using acceleration and using NVIDIA's platform, we could inference any model from computer vision to speech, to chemistry, to biology, you name it. We do it so quickly and so fast that the cost is very low.\nThe more acceleration you do, the more money you will save. I think that wisdom is absolutely true. The second dimension is training to inference. The third dimension is that we now have so many different types of configurations of systems that we can go from high-performance computing systems all the way to cloud, to on-prem, to edge. The final concept is really this industrial deployment now of AI that's causing us to be able to, in just about every industry, find growth. As you know, our cloud and hyperscalers are growing very, very quickly. However, the vertical industries, which is the financial services, retail, and telco, and all of those vertical industries, have also grown very, very nicely. In all of those different dimensions, our visibility should be a lot better.\nStarting a couple of years ago, adding the Mellanox portfolio to our company, we're able to provide a lot more solution-oriented end-to-end platform solutions for companies that don't have the skills and don't have the technical depth to be able to stand up these sophisticated systems. Our networking business is growing very, very nicely as well.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line's open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just want to maybe just ask this question a little bit more directly. It's good to see the team being able to drive, navigate the dynamic supply chain environment, right? You built strong sequential growth in data center in April, here in the July quarter, even with some demand impact from Russia, right?\nAs we think about the second half of the year, cloud spending is strong, and it's actually, I think, accelerating. You're getting ready to ramp H100 later in the year. Mellanox, I think, is getting more supply as you move through the year. In general, I think previously you guys were anticipating sequential supply and revenue growth for the business through this entire year. I understand the uncertainty around gaming. Does the team expect continued sequential growth in data center through the remainder of the year?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nEither one of us can answer. The answer is yes. The answer is yes. We see strong demand in data center, hyperscale, the cloud computing, and the vertical industries. Ampere is going to continue to scale out. It's been qualified in every single company in the world.\nAfter two years, it remains the best universal accelerator on the planet, and it's going to continue to scale out in all these different domains and different markets. We're going to layer on top of that a brand new architecture, Hopper. We're going to layer on top of that brand new networking architectures, Quantum 3, CX7, BlueField-3. We have increasing supply. We're looking forward to an excellent quarter, next quarter again for data centers, and going into the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line's open.\n\nChris Caso\n\nSenior US Semiconductor Analyst, Raymond James\n\nYes, thank you. I wonder if you could speak a little bit about the purchase obligations, which seemed like they were up again in the quarter, and how that was—was that a function of longer-dated obligations or a higher magnitude of obligations?\nMaybe you could just speak to supply constraints in general. You've mentioned a couple of times in the call about continued constraints in the networking business. What about the other parts of the business? Where are you still constrained?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. Let me start here, and I'll see if Jensen wants to add more of that. Our purchase obligations, as well as our prepaids, have two major things to keep in mind. One, for the first time ever, we are prepaying to make sure that we have that supply and those commitments long-term. Additionally, on our purchase obligations, many of them are for long lead-time items that are a must for us to procure to make sure that we have for the products coming to market.\nA good percentage of our purchase commitments is for our data center business, which you can imagine are much larger systems, much more complex systems, and those things that we are procuring to make sure we can feed the demand both in the upcoming quarters and further. Areas in terms of where we are still a little bit supply-constrained. Our networking, our demand is quite strong. We've been improving it each time. Yes, we still have demand, excuse me, supply concerns with networking still. Are there others that you want to add on, Jensen?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nNo, I thought you were perfect. That was perfect.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line's open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for fitting me in. Most of my questions around gaming and data center have been answered. I guess I'll ask about the auto segment.\nWhile it's still small, clearly, you guys sound confident in that business starting to see significant sequential growth into this next quarter. I wondered if you could help us kind of think about the trajectory of that business over the next couple of quarters. I think in the past, you've said that that should start to really inflect higher as we move into the second half of the year. Just curious if you could help us think about that piece of the business.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nSeveral data points. We are just starting. We have just started shipping Orin and the first quarter of shipping production Orin. Orin is a robotics processor. It's designed for a software-defined robotic car, or robotic pick and placer, or a robotic mover, logistics mover.\nWe've been designed into 35 car and truck and robotaxi companies, and more others if you include logistics movers, last-mile delivery systems, and farming equipment. The number of design wins for Orin is really quite fantastic. Orin is a revolutionary processor, and it's designed as a, if you will, data center on a chip. It is the first data center on a chip that is robotic, processes sensor information, is safe, and has the ability to be rather resilient. It has confidential computing. It is designed to be secure, designed to be all those things because these data centers are going to be everywhere. Orin is really a technological marvel in production. We experience very likely the lowest auto quarter for some time.\nThe reason for that is because over the next six years or so, we have $11 billion and counting of business that we've secured, estimated. I think it's a fairly safe thing to say now that Orin and our autonomous vehicle and robotics business is going to be our next multi-billion dollar business. It's on its way surely there. The robotics and autonomous systems and autonomous machines, whether they move or not move, but AI systems that are at the physical edge, is surely going to be the next major computing segment. It is surely going to be the next major data center segment. We've been working in this area, as you know, for a decade. We have a fair amount of expertise in this area. Orin is just one example of our work here.\nWe have four pillars to our strategy for autonomous systems, starting from the data processing and the AI training part of it to train robotics AIs, second, to simulate robotics AIs, which is Omniverse, third, to be the memory of the robotics AI, otherwise known as mapping, and finally, the actual robotics application and the robotics processor in the system. That's where Orin goes. Orin is just one of our four pillars of our robotics strategy and the next wave of AI. I am really optimistic and really enthusiastic about the next phase of the computer industry's growth. I think a lot of it's going to be at the edge, and a lot of it's going to be about robotics.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for any additional closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFounder, President, and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, everyone.\nThe full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities remain unchanged. The effectiveness of deep learning AI continues to astound. The transformer model, which led to the natural language understanding breakthroughs, is being advanced to learn patterns with great spatial, sequential, and temporal complexity. Researchers are creating transformer models that are revolutionizing applications from robotics to drug discovery. The effectiveness of deep learning AI is driving companies across industries to adopt NVIDIA for AI computing. We're focused on four major initiatives. First, ramping our next generation of AI infrastructure chips and platforms: Hopper GPU, BlueField DPU, NVLink, Quantum InfiniBand, Spectrum Ethernet networking. All this to help customers build their AI factories and take advantage of new AI breakthroughs like transformers.\nSecond, ramping our system and software industry partners to launch Grace, our first CPU. Third, ramping Orin, our new robotics processor, and nearly 40 customers building cars, robotaxis, trucks, delivery robots, logistics robots, farming robots, to medical instruments. Fourth, with our software platforms, adding new value to our ecosystem with NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, and expanding into new markets with new CUDA acceleration libraries. These initiatives will greatly advance AI, while continuing to extend this most impactful technology of our time to scientists in every field, and companies in every industry. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with revenue up 53% year-on-year to $7.6 billion. We set records for total revenue, as well as for gaming, data center, and professional visualization. Full-year revenue was a record, $26.9 billion, up 61%, compounding the prior year's growth of 53%. Starting with gaming, revenue of $3.4 billion rose 6% sequentially and was up 37% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 61%. Gaming has become the top entertainment medium and continues to show strong momentum. Just last month, Steam hit a record 28 million concurrent users, up 50% in two years. Record desktop revenue in the quarter was led by our growth in our GeForce RTX 30 series products, with continued strength in the high end.\nAt CES, we announced the RTX 3050 GPU, which hit retail in late January, bringing NVIDIA RTX and AI technologies to more mainstream audiences. Laptop gaming revenue also set a record, driven by the ramp of the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti GPUs, which were also announced at CES. These leverage our fourth-generation Max-Q technology to enable quiet, thin, and light gaming laptops. All in, we announced over 160 new laptop designs for NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX 30 series GPUs. These include a number of studio systems targeting the tens of millions of creators driving the future of design, innovation, and virtual worlds. In addition to supporting the new RTX 30 series GPUs, studio laptops feature support for NVIDIA software like Omniverse, Canvas, and Broadcast. Availability of our gaming products in the channel remains low.\nNVIDIA RTX ecosystem continues to expand, with over 30 new RTX games and applications added this quarter, including blockbuster hits like Battlefield 2042, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Call of Duty: Vanguard, and God of War. In addition, several new titles support NVIDIA Reflex for low-latency gameplay. Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, though we have limited visibility into how much of this impacts our overall GPU demand. Nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are light hash rate to help direct GeForce supply to gamers. Crypto mining processor revenue was $24 million, which is included in OEM and other. We continue to expand the NVIDIA GeForce Now cloud gaming ecosystem with new hit titles, including EA's Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 5. At CES, we announced a partnership with Samsung to integrate GeForce Now in its smart TVs, starting in Q2 of this year.\nThis follows last month's beta release of the GeForce Now app for LG smart TVs. In addition, we teamed up with AT&T to bring GeForce Now to 5G mobile devices in the US. We also added our first GFN data center in Canada. Moving to pro visualization, Q4 revenue was $643 million, up 11% sequentially, and up 109% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $2.1 billion was up 100%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a shift to higher value workstations, and the continued ramp of our NVIDIA Ampere architecture. We believe strong demand is fueled by continued build-outs for hybrid work environments, as well as growth in key workloads, including 3D design, AI, and rendering. For example, Sony Pictures Imageworks is using NVIDIA RTX to accelerate ray tracing for rendering-related applications.\nVolkswagen is using NVIDIA RTX for AI to assist in predictive maintenance of their vehicles. Duke Energy is using NVIDIA RTX for AI and VR to map, view, and maintain energy facilities. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise software entered general availability, and while it's still in early days, customer feedback so far has been very positive, with multiple significant enterprise licenses already signed. In addition to software licenses, Omniverse also drives computing opportunity for NVIDIA RTX in laptops, workstations, on-prem servers, and the cloud. Omniverse can be used by individuals for free and by enterprise teams via software subscriptions. At CES, we made the free version of Omniverse for individuals general availability. Omniverse allows creators with RTX GPUs to connect leading 3D design applications to a single scene, and supercharge their work with AI and physics.\nWe also announced early access to Omniverse Cloud, which adds one-click capability to collaborate with other artists, whether across the room or across the globe. For digital twin applications, we announced the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robot platform. Using Omniverse and securely orchestrated and cloud-delivered with Fleet Command, the platform optimizes operational efficiency and accelerates deployment of logistics robots. It consists of several NVIDIA AI technologies and SDKs, including DeepMap for high-precision mapping, Metropolis for situational awareness, and ReOP for real-time route optimization. Moving to automotive, Q4 revenue was $125 million, declined 7% sequentially, and 14% from a year-ago quarter. Fiscal year revenue of $566 million was up 6%. We have just started shipments of our O-RAN-based drive platform and expect to return to sequential revenue growth in Q1, with more meaningful inflection in the second half of the fiscal year, and momentum building into calendar 2023 and beyond.\nI will now hand it over to Jensen to provide more color on this morning's automotive news.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Colette. Earlier today, we announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver fleets of software-defined cars. Starting in 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will have next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled software and services built on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. DRIVE O-RAN will be the AI computer brain running our DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software, and the DRIVE Hyperion sensor network will be the central nervous system. This new vehicle architecture will enable a wide spectrum of active safety, automated driving, and parking systems. Inside the vehicle, the system will deliver AI features, including driver and occupant monitoring, and advanced visualization of the vehicle's surroundings. We are very much looking forward to partnering with Thierry Bolloré, JLR's CEO, and his team to reinvent the future of luxury cars.\nOur full-stack end-to-end approach is a new business model that offers downloadable AV and AI services to the fleet of JLR vehicles, with a shared software revenue stream for both companies over the life of the fleet. This partnership follows the template of our announcement with Mercedes-Benz. Our shared software revenue opportunity with both OEMs will scale with the size of their NVIDIA-powered fleet, which combined can exceed 10 million cars over a decade. Colette, back to you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Jensen. Moving to data center. Record revenue of $3.3 billion grew 11% sequentially, and 71% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $10.6 billion was up 58%. Data center growth in the quarter was once again led by our compute products on strong demand for NVIDIA AI. Hyperscale and cloud demand was outstanding, with revenue more than doubling year on year. Vertical industries also posted strong double-digit year-on-year growth, led by consumer internet companies. The flagship NVIDIA A100 GPU continued to drive strong growth. Inference-focused revenue more than tripled year on year. Accelerating inference growth has been enabled by widespread adoption of our Triton Inference Server software, which helps customers deliver fast and scalable AI in production.\nData center compute demand was driven by continued deployment of our Ampere Architecture-based products for fast-growing AI workloads, such as natural language processing, deep learning recommendation systems, and cloud computing. For example, Block, a global leader in payment, uses conversational AI in its Square Assistant to schedule appointments with customers. These AI models are trained on NVIDIA GPUs and AWS and perform inference 10x faster on the AWS GPU service than on our CPUs. Social media company Snap used NVIDIA GPUs and Merlin Deep Recommender software to improve inference cost efficiency by 50% and decrease latency by 2x. For the third year in a row, industry benchmarks show that NVIDIA AI continues to lead the industry in performance.\nAlong with partners like Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA sets records in the latest MLPerf benchmarks for AI training across eight popular AI workloads, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, and object detection. NVIDIA AI was the only platform to make submissions across all benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating versatility, as well as high performance. The numbers show performance gains on our A100 GPUs of over 5x in just 18 months, thanks to continuous innovations across the full stack in AI algorithms, optimization tools, and system software. Over the past three years, they show performance gains of over 20x, powered by advances we have made across our full stack offering GPUs, networks, systems, and software. The leading performance of NVIDIA AI is sought after by some of the world's most technically advanced companies.\nMeta Platforms unveiled its new AI supercomputer, Research Supercluster, with over 6,000 A100 GPUs linked to an MLPerf benchmarks network. Meta's earliest benchmarks showed its system can train large natural language processing models 3x faster and run computer vision jobs 20x faster than the prior system. In a second phase later this year, the system will expand to 16,000 GPUs that Meta believes will deliver 5x of mixed precision AI performance. In addition to performance at scale, Meta cited extreme reliability, security, privacy, and flexibility to handle a wide range of AI models as its key criteria for the system. We continue to broaden the reach and ease the adoption of NVIDIA AI into vertical industries. Our ecosystem of NVIDIA-certified systems expanded with Cisco and Hitachi Vantara, which joined Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur, Lenovo, and Supermicro, among other server manufacturers.\nWe released version 1.1 of our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, allowing enterprises to run accelerated AI workloads on VMware vSphere on mainstream IT infrastructure as well. We expanded the number of system integrators qualified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Forrester Research, in its evaluation of enterprise AI infrastructure providers, recognized NVIDIA in the top category of leaders. An example of a partner that's helping to expand our reach into enterprise IT is Deloitte, a leading global consulting firm, which has built its center for AI computing on NVIDIA DGX Superclouds. At CES, we extended our collaboration to AV development, leveraging our own robust AI infrastructure and Deloitte's team of 5,500 system integration developers and 2,000 data scientists to architect solutions for truly intelligent transportation. Our networking products posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, driven by exceptional demand across use cases ranging from cloud computing, Supercomputing, and enterprise to storage.\nThese are not adapters-led growth, driven by adoption of our next-generation products and higher-speed deployments. While revenue was gated by supply, we anticipate improving capacity in coming quarters that should allow us to serve the significant customer demand we are seeing. Across the board, we are excited about the traction we are seeing with our new software business models, including NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA DRIVE. We are still early in the software revenue ramp. Our pipelines are building as customers across the industries seek to accelerate their pace of adoption and innovation with NVIDIA. Now, let me turn it back over to Jensen for some comments on O-RAN.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Colette. Last week, we terminated our efforts to purchase Arm. When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believed it would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all Arm customers in the entire ecosystem. Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide. We appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we'd worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong, and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal. NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before. Our focus is accelerated computing.\nWe are on track to launch our Arm-based Grace CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads in the first half of next year. Our 20-year architectural license to Arm's IP allows us the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets. We will deliver on our three-chip strategy across CPUs, GPUs, and DPUs. Whether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job and, together with partners in the computer industry, offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time. Back to you, Colette.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, Jensen. We're going to turn to our P&L and our Outlook. For the discussion of the rest of the P&L, please refer to the CFO commentary published earlier today on our Industrial Relations website. Let me turn to the Outlook for the Q1 of fiscal 2023. We expect sequential growth to be driven primarily by data center. Gaming will also contribute to growth. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, ±2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, ±50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $3.55 billion, including the ARM write-off of $1.36 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.6 billion. For the fiscal year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses at a similar percent as in fiscal 2022.\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 11% and 13%, ±1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to 400 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in person on 7 March 2024. We will also be hosting a virtual investor day on 22 March 2024 alongside the GPU Technology Conference. This will follow Jensen's opening keynote, which we invite you to tune in for.\nOur earnings call to discuss the results for our Q1 of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, 25 May 2023. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please hold for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs and Company. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen and Colette, I wanted to ask about data center. Colette, based on your guidance, you're probably guiding data center growth on a year-over-year basis to accelerate into the April quarter. You talked about hyperscale, cloud growing more than 2x, and enterprise or your verticals growing strong double digits in the January quarter. Can you kind of speak to the drivers for April and perhaps speak to visibility into the second half of the fiscal year as well in data center? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nSure.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nI'll start, and I'll turn it over to Jensen. For Q1, our guidance can include an acceleration of data center from where we left in terms of Q4. We will have growth across several of our market platforms within Q1, both data center, gaming, and probably a couple others. Yes, there is expected to be accelerated growth as we move into Q1. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk about the drivers that we see for the quarter and also for the full year.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, we have several—first of all, Toshiya, great to hear from you. We have several growth drivers in data centers. There's hyperscale, public cloud, enterprise core, and enterprise edge. We're seeing growth across the entire spectrum. There are several different use cases that are particularly exciting: large language models, language understanding models triggered by the invention of transformers, which is probably one of the most important AI models that's been invented in some time, and conversational AI used for customer service, chatbots, a whole bunch of customer service applications. It could be web-based, point-of-sale-based, or cloud-based. Recommender systems, deep learning-based recommender systems are making groundbreaking improvements. Cloud graphics, all of the work that we're doing and putting rendering or putting simulations up in the cloud, cloud gaming, Android cloud gaming are really driving adoption in the cloud.\nSo many different use cases, but across all of the different platforms and data centers.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to CJ Muse with Evercore ISI.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess another question on the data center side. Curious if you can speak to supply constraints on the wafer side and whether that played a role in terms of capping revenues in the January quarter, and how you see that becoming less of a headwind for you as you proceed through the year.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, CJ, for the question. I'll start on the data center supply. As we discussed last quarter and discussed today, we still have some supply constraints across some of our businesses. Networking in the data center business has been a supply constraint. We're improving every single day. We do expect to improve supply each quarter as we enter into fiscal year 2023 here. That is probably the key area within our data center. From time to time, there can be other types of focus in data centers. I'll turn the rest of the question to Jensen in terms of how about the rest of the year as well.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, Colette captured it well. Our supply constraint, our demand is greater than our supply. As you know, our data center product line consists of GPUs, NICs, BlueField DPUs, Quantum and Spectrum switches, HGX, if you will, system component, meaning that the entire motherboard or the entire GPU board is delivered in combination because it's so complicated. We have products that span a broad reach of use cases for data centers, from training of AI models to inferencing at very large scale to universal GPUs for public cloud, industry-standard servers, commodity servers for enterprise use, and Supercomputing systems that use InfiniBand and Quantum switches. The application space is quite broad. We saw demand constraint pretty much across the entire range. Our operations team did a fantastic job this year, both in executing all of these complicated products, but also in expanding our supply base.\nWe expect supply to improve each and every quarter going forward. This quarter, this coming quarter, the April quarter is based on guidance that Colette just made, is consistent with an increasing supply base. We expect to still be demand constrained, but our supply base is going to increase this quarter, this next quarter, and pretty substantially in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Grace now that the strategy kind of separated from the acquisition of Arm. What are your aspirations there? Is it going to be primarily oriented to the DGX and EGX systems business versus merchant chips? Just how are you thinking about that opportunity long term?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Joe. We have multiple O-RAN projects going in the company, connected from devices to robotics processors such as the new O-RAN that's going into autonomous vehicles, robotics systems, industrial automation, robotics, and such. O-RAN is doing incredibly well. It started production. As we mentioned earlier, it's going to drive an inflection point starting in Q2, accelerating through Q3, and the several years after as we ramp into all of the electric cars, all of the robotic applications, mobile taxis, and such. We also have O-RAN projects with the CPU that you mentioned, Grace. We have Grace, and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace. You could expect us to do a lot of CPU developments around the O-RAN architecture.\nOne of the things that's really developed nicely over the last couple of years is the success that O-RAN has seen in hyperscalers and data centers. It's really accelerated and motivated them to accelerate the development of higher-end CPUs. You're going to see a lot of exciting CPUs coming from us. Grace is just the first example. You're going to see a whole bunch of them beyond that. Our strategy is accelerated computing. That's ultimately what we do for a living. We, as you know, love it where there's any CPUs, if it's an x86 from any vendor. So long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence, computer graphics, robotics, and such. We love to see the expansion of CPU footprints.\nWe're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, Supercomputing, and all these different applications. We intend to bring the full spectrum of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform to NVIDIA Arm CPUs.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nYeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Colette and Jensen, just on the inventory purchase obligations, I think this was the Q4 in a row where you've seen greater than 30% sequential growth. It's the Q1 where that number is now eclipsing kind of your quarterly revenue guidance. I guess I'm trying to figure out to what extent is this just a reflection of how tight things are across the semi industry. To what extent is this a poker tell of kind of how bullish you are on future demand? Relative to your commentary, that supply starts to get better throughout the year, should we expect that number to start to level off? As the mix moves more to data center, more to longer cycle times, more complicated devices, should that number continue to grow?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThe factors, the drivers that you mentioned in the supply chain, we expanded our supply chain footprint significantly this year to prepare us for both increased supply base and supply availability in each one of the quarters going forward, but also in preparation for some really exciting product launches. As mentioned, O-RAN ramping into autonomous vehicles is brand new. This is the inflection point of us growing into autonomous vehicles. This is going to be a very large business for us going forward. It was already mentioned, Grace is a brand new product that has never been on NVIDIA's roadmap. We already see great success with customers who love the architecture of it and desperately in need of the type of capability that Grace brings. This should be a pretty exciting year for new product launches.\nWe're preparing for all of that, laying the foundation for us to bring all those exciting products to the marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS.\n\nTim Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you very much. Obviously, there's a lot more talk from you about software. I think it's still kind of a little bit of a black box for a lot of investors. I know, Jensen, that you've talked about software as a medium to basically open up new markets. I'm wondering if you can sort of quantify how big the software licensing revenue is today and maybe when you might start to break it out like you did data center, which really got the stock moving in a huge, huge way. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, NVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business. It starts from recognizing what domain of applications we want to accelerate and can accelerate, and then building an entire stack from the processor to the system, to the system software, the acceleration engines, and potentially even the applications itself, like the software that we were mentioning earlier, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse. These are applications that sit on top of system software and are really valuable to the marketplace. The way to think about our software licensing, we've always been a software-driven business, but for the very first time, we have packaged licensable software available to customers. The way that we license software for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is per node of server. There's some 20, 25 million servers that are installed in the world today in enterprises, not including clouds.\nWe believe that every single server in the future will be running AI software. We would like to offer an engine that enables enterprises to be able to use the most advanced, the most trusted, the most utilized AI engine in the world. That is essentially the target market, if you will, for NVIDIA AI. The NVIDIA Omniverse is designed for creators contributing content to a virtual world and connected to robots that are contributing to content in a virtual world. It is based on connections. There are 40 million designers and creators around the world. There are going to be hundreds of millions of robots. Every single car will essentially be a robot someday. Those are connections that will be connected into a digital twin system like Omniverse. The Omniverse business model is per connection per year.\nIn the case of NVIDIA DRIVE, we share the economics of the software that we deliver. If it's AV software, parking software, or cabin-based AI software, whatever the licensing is or whatever the service, if it's an upfront license, we share the economics of that. If it's a monthly service subscription, we share the economics of that. Basically, for the cars that we are part of, that we're developing, the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car. You could imagine what 10 million cars with modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. Our business opportunity is based on those factors.\nOur software business really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse, and DRIVE. Watch the spot. I think this is going to be a very significant business opportunity for us, and we look forward to reporting on it.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you mentioned about a 10% or so adoption rate for AI among your customer base. I was hoping you would quantify where we are in that adoption curve, that you could kind of differentiate between the adoption differences between your hyperscale and enterprise customers. Kind of related to that, is there an inorganic element to your growth now that you have over $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How are you planning to deploy that to kind of accelerate your growth also?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah. The applications for AI is unquestionably growing, and it's growing incredibly fast. Whether in enterprises and financial services, it could be fraud detection. In cases of consumer-pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI where people are calling chatbots. In the future, every website will have a chatbot. Every phone number will have a chatbot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, will have a chatbot. Customer service will be heavily, heavily supported by artificial intelligence in the future. Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's fast foods or quick service, businesses are going to have chatbots and AI-based customer service. Retail checkouts will be supported by AI agents. All of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs.\nComputer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact, recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about, and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service. The ability to have human in the loop is one of the great things about an AI, much, much more so than a recording, which obviously is not intelligent. Therefore, it's difficult to, if you will, call your manager or call somebody to provide services that the AI can't. The number of different applications that have been enabled by natural language understanding in customer service in just the last couple of years has grown tremendously. I think we remain early, early, early days in AI adoption.\nIt's incredible how fast it's grown and how many different applications are now possible with AI. It pretty much says that almost all future software will be written with AI or by AI. When it's done, it will be an AI. We see it in all these different industries. I'm pretty certain we're in the early innings yet of AI. This is going to be one of the largest industries of software that we have ever known. With respect to capital, as you know, we had just terminated our Arm agreement. We have a regular capital strategy process. We'll go through that, and we'll make the best judgment about how to use our capital in helping our growth, sustaining our growth, and accelerating our growth. We'll have all of those sensible conversations during those capital allocation meetings.\nWe're just delighted to have so much capital, just to put it out there.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Can you guys talk about how the launch of the RTX 3050 is going so far? Maybe more broadly, your view of where we are in the Ampere product cycle on gaming. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Michael. Let's see. RTX is an unqualified home run. RTX completely reinvented modern computer graphics. It brought forward ray tracing about a decade earlier than anybody thought possible. The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our shader processors, but also engage the powerful Tensor Core processors that we have in our GPUs to generate images, beautiful images. RTX is being adopted by just about every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now. If not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible.\nWe wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars, lidars, ultrasonics, and, of course, cameras, and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we deliver. RTX was a game changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics, and it was an enabler for us to build an entire new platform called Omniverse. We're about, I think, about 1/3 of the way through upgrading an install base that is growing. You know that video games is now the world's largest gaming genre. Steam, over the last two years, has grown by 50%. The number of concurrent players on Steam has grown tremendously. In just the last couple of years, a brand new game store from Epic came on, and it's already a multi-hundred million dollar business.\nI think it's close to a billion dollars that they're doing incredibly well. I'm so happy to see it. The overall gaming market is growing, and it's growing quite nicely. The thing that, in addition to resetting computer graphics for our entire install base, the growing of our install base because gaming is growing, there are a couple of other growth dynamics that are associated with GeForce and RTX that's really quite brand new. One of them is hybrid work. This is a permanent condition. We now are seeing across the board, people who are designers and creators now have to set up essentially a new workstation or new home workstation design studio so that they could do their work at home.\nIn addition, the creative economy, the digital economy, the creative economy is really, really doing fantastically because everything has to be done in 3D now. Print ads are done in 3D. 2D print is done in 3D. Video is done in 3D. Live video, broadcast video, the millions of influencers now augment their broadcast with rich augmented reality and 3D graphics. 3D graphics is now not just for video games and 3D content. It's actually used now for all forms of digital content creation. RTX has all of these different drivers working behind it. We're definitely in the early innings of RTX.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You said that the growth in the next quarter, it's about $450 million, give or take, driven by data center. Can you give us some feeling for how that growth is being driven by units versus pricing versus mix, and how those drivers might differ between gaming and data center, if at all, for Colette?\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nIt's really early in the quarter to determine, Stacy, our exact mix that we will have based on a unit and an ASP across the board. Our overall growth, quarter-over-quarter, going into Q1, will be driven by data center primarily. We will see a little bit of growth there in gaming. I think that's important to understand that even after Q4 and holiday, moving into Q1, we'll still probably see growth here in gaming, which is different in terms of what we've seen seasonally. We will probably have growth in automotive as well, sequentially between Q4 and Q1. There are still some areas that are supply constrained. We are working, again, to try and improve that for every quarter going forward. That's how you should look at our Q1, primarily from data center.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Congratulations on the solid results and execution. The networking connectivity portfolio edition has been pretty solid for the NVIDIA team, especially in enabling scaling of your GPU systems, improving connectivity bottlenecks in yours and your customers' accelerated compute platforms. In a year where cloud spending is growing 30%, you've got a strong networking upgrade cycle, which is good for your NIC products, and just continued overall good attach rates. If the team can unlock more supply, will the networking connectivity business grow in line or faster than the overall data center business this year? For Jensen, have you driven synergies between Mellanox's leadership in networking connectivity and, for example, leveraging their capabilities for your internally developed NVLink connectivity and switching architectures?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYes, absolutely. If not for the work that we did so closely with Mellanox, the scalability of DGX, DGX SuperPOD, and the research supercomputer that was just installed at Meta would just not be possible. The concepts of overlapping networking and compute, moving computing into the fabric, into the network, the work that we're doing with synchronous and precision timing so that we could create omniverse computers that obey the laws of physics and space-time, these things are just simply not possible. The work that we're doing to bring cloud-native, secure multi-tenancy to Supercomputing wouldn't have been possible. The number of innovations are countless. I am so thrilled with the combination and so thrilled with the work that the Mellanox team are doing. We've accelerated roadmaps as a result of the combination that we could leverage a much larger base of chip design.\nBlueField's roadmap has been accelerated probably by about a year. The switch, the Quantum switch, and the Spectrum switch, the switches are absolutely world-class, shared between Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink. Absolutely the best switches in the world. The list of opportunities or the list of combination benefits is really quite countless. I'm super thrilled with that. With respect to networking growth, we should be growing. If we weren't supply constrained, we should be growing faster than overall CSP growth. The reason for that is twofold. The first is because the networking leadership position of Mellanox is highly heavyweight in the upper end of networking, where the adoption of higher-speed networks tends to move. It's sensible that as new data centers are built, the first preference is to install it with higher-speed networking than last-generation networking.\nMellanox's networking technology is unambiguously world-class. The second reason is because the areas where the overall NVIDIA is strong has to do with the areas that are growing quite fast related to artificial intelligence or cloud AI and such. Those different applications are growing faster than the core, and it would be sensible that we have the opportunity as we expand our supply base to continue to grow faster than CSPs overall.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nYes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I maybe wanted to expand on some of the things that you were just speaking about in your last answer with respect to the data center business. It's not often, maybe if ever, that you have both x86 server vendors having new big platform upgrades in the same year, which will probably happen later this year. There's a lot going on there, DDR5s, PCIe 5, some CXL stuff. I wonder if you could talk a bit about your data center business broadly and what you feel might be memory and I/O constraint currently that these systems might unlock for you, both in the cloud and enterprise side, but also in the DGX business. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks, Matt. There are several bottlenecks, and let me just highlight some of them. One of the largest bottlenecks is memory speed. Memory speed, that's the reason why we use the fastest memories in the world, HBM and GDDR, etc., etc. We are the largest consumers of the fastest memories in the world, and not even by, not with no close second that I know. Our consumption of fast memories is important to the work that we do. The second is networking performance. It is the reason why we have the fastest networks. It is also the reason why we have the most fastest networks in any system. We will have, for example, eight InfiniBand at the highest speeds connected right into an HGX or DGX server.\nThe work that we do in GPU direct memory, RDMA, the work that we do with GPU direct storage, the work that we do with in-network computing, all reductions, and moving data around inside a network is absolutely world-class. This is an area that I am just incredibly proud of. All of that is so that we could be less bottlenecked by the CPU. Remember, inside our DGX system is one CPU and eight GPUs. The fundamental goal is to offload as much as we can and utilize the resources that we have as much as we can. This year, we expect a transition in PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 5. We are constrained on Gen 4. We'll be constrained on Gen 5, but we're used to that, and that's something that we're very good at.\nWe'll continue to support Gen 4 well through next year, maybe well through the next couple of years in all of the installed base of Gen 4 systems that are going to be all over the world. We'll take advantage of Gen 5 as much as we can. We have all kinds of new technologies and strategies to improve the throughput of systems and avert the bottlenecks that are there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Rajvi Gill with Needham & Company.\n\nRajvi Gill\n\nManaging Director, Needham & Company\n\nYes, thanks. Congrats on the good quarter and guide. Colette, a question on the gross margin and to Jensen's point about really creating a software business driven by Omniverse, DRIVE, and Enterprise. When you're kind of contemplating your margin profile over the next couple of years, how do we think about that? Is it really going to be driven by an increasing mix of software as a percentage of your revenue over time? Is there more margin upside on the hardware side in terms of some of your segments? The software opportunity is very exciting, but I'm just curious how that would translate to your kind of more of a longer-term margin profile. Thank you.\n\nColette Kress\n\nEVP and CFO, NVIDIA\n\nYeah, thanks for the question on gross margin and the long term. When we think about the long term of gross margin, we have incorporated software in many of our platforms even today. Meaning our high-value platforms in data center, Pro Viz, other parts of our business have really helped us with our gross margin to this point. We've done a really solid job of managing that and the growth over the years. I believe these businesses will continue to be a growing opportunity for us, now also with the ability to package up software and sell it separately. As that scales with our enterprise customers in the data center and with our already procured deals, we've got a great opportunity in the future and the margin to come. We're going to work on that.\nWe've set the stage for having been able to package it up to be able to sell it separately, to create the business models, to create the partners that are helping us sell it. Yes, we do believe this will be a driver in the long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nPresident and CEO, NVIDIA\n\nThanks, everyone. The tremendous demand for our computing platforms, NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC, and NVIDIA AI, drove a great quarter, capping a record year. Our work propels advances in AI, digital biology, climate sciences, gaming, creative design to autonomous vehicles and robotics, and some of today's most impactful fields. Our open computing platform, optimized across the full stack, architected for data center scale, is adopted by customers globally from cloud to core to edge and robotics. I am proud of NVIDIA's operations team as we made substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. This year, we introduced new software business models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA DRIVE. NVIDIA DRIVE is a full-stack end-to-end platform that serves the industry with AV chips, data center infrastructure for AI and simulation, mapping, and the autonomous driving application service.\nOur data center infrastructure is used by just about anybody building AVs, robotics, robotaxis, shuttles, and trucks. EV companies have selected our orange chip across the world. Our partnership with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover has opened up a new software and services business model for millions of cars for the life of the fleet. NVIDIA Omniverse is a world simulation engine that connects simulated digital worlds to the physical world. Omniverse is a digital twin, a simulation of the physical world. The system can be a building, a factory, a warehouse, a car, a fleet of cars, a robotic factory orchestrating a fleet of robots building cars that are themselves robotic. Today's internet is 2D, and AI is in the cloud. The next phase of internet will be 3D, and AI will be connected to the physical world.\nWe created Omniverse to enable the next wave of AI, where AI and robotics touches our world. Omniverse can sound like science fiction, but there are real-world use cases today. Hundreds of companies are evaluating Omniverse. We can't wait to share more of our progress at next month's GTC. Learn about new chips, new computing platforms, new AI and robotic breakthroughs, and the new frontiers of Omniverse. Hear from the technologists of Deloitte, Epic Games, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Pfizer, Sony, Visa, Walt Disney, Zoom, and more. This GTC promises to be our most exciting developers' conference ever. We had quite a year, yet nothing makes me more proud than the incredible people who have made NVIDIA one of the best companies to work for, and the company where they do their life's work. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

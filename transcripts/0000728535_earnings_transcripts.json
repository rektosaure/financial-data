Hunt Transport Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Hall, Senior Director of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, Brad Delco; Spencer Frazier, EVP of Sales and Marketing; our COO and President of Highway Services and Final Mile, Nick Hobbs; Brad Hicks, President of Dedicated Contract Services; and Darren Field, President of Intermodal.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. Throughout the year, our focus has been on 3 clear priorities: operational excellence, scaling into our investments and continuing to repair our margins to drive stronger financial performance. We are executing these priorities with discipline and determination, guided by a strategy designed to strengthen our competitive position and unlock long-term value for our shareholders. I am highly confident that our approach is building a stronger company, one that is fully equipped to capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities ahead while driving stronger financial performance.\nAcross our businesses, service levels remain excellent. We have systemically elevated our service standards to drive disciplined, profitable growth with both new and existing customers. Even as overall freight demand softened during the quarter, our unwavering commitment to service enabled our intermodal and highway businesses to capture additional volume and outperform the market. Operational excellence is now synonymous with J.B. Hunt, and we are leveraging this reputation to drive strategic growth and maximize returns on our investments to match the unique value and strong service levels we provide for customers.\nWe remain focused on controlling what we can, optimizing costs in the near term without sacrificing our future earnings power potential. In addition, we are placing a heightened emphasis on operational efficiency throughout the organization. By streamlining processes, adopting best practices and leveraging technology, we aim to utilize every resource as effectively as possible to maximize productivity and performance. Our initiative to lower our cost to serve announced last quarter is focused on removing structural costs from our business.\nThe organization's collaborative efforts continue to gain momentum, and Brad will share more details on our progress. This initiative marks our latest evolution and expense discipline, and we are making good progress towards reaching our $100 million savings goal and advancing towards our long-term margin target.\nNow let me address the elephant in the room, rail consolidation. J.B. Hunt's position is rooted in our commitment to delivering exceptional intermodal service and creating long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We recognize both the opportunities and risks that consolidation presents, but our decades of experience, including navigating 7 prior Class 1 railroad mergers and our thoughtfully developed long-term agreements and strong relationships with NS, CSX and BNSF should provide the basis for us to adapt to any changes in the industry. As the largest domestic intermodal provider, our scale and influence allow us to coordinate complex intermodal moves and deliver unique solutions for our customers.\nWe are consistently rated best-in-class by third-party industry surveys of intermodal customers and our ability to deliver seamless, differentiated service across the entire North American intermodal network is a key competitive advantage. Our focus remains on providing reliable, efficient and innovative service that benefits our customers now and into the future.\nAs the rail industry evolves, we expect our proven adaptability and unwavering dedication to service will not only safeguard our leadership position, but should also continuously set higher standards of excellence for our customers.\nI want to close by recognizing the entire organization for their hard work and progress across many areas of focus. The third quarter is extra special at J.B. Hunt as it includes National Truck Driver and National Technician Appreciation weeks. Our professional drivers and maintenance teams are the backbone of our success, and their record-breaking safety performance is a testament to their skill, dedication and attention to safety every day. We appreciate all they do to keep our company, our customers and our communities safe.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our newly appointed CFO, Brad Delco. Brad?\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nI will hit on some highlights of the quarter, review our capital allocation plan and give an update on the lowering our cost to serve initiative.\nLet me start with the quarter. As you have already seen from our release, revenue was roughly flat year-over-year, while operating income improved 8% and diluted earnings per share improved 18% versus the prior year period. While inflation in insurance, wages and employee benefits and equipment costs were all up, our productivity and cost management efforts more than offset those headwinds to drive our improved results.\nOver the years, you have heard us talk about investing in our long-term growth, maintaining cost discipline without jeopardizing our future earnings power and creating operating leverage when the market returns. Well, it's no secret, the market hasn't returned yet, but the notable improvement in our financial performance this quarter should serve as a true testament to the talent and capabilities of the people throughout our organization and the execution of our strategy towards operational excellence in safety, service and lowering our cost to serve.\nOn capital allocation, our balance sheet remains healthy, maintaining leverage around our target of 1x trailing 12-month EBITDA, while purchasing over $780 million or 5.4 million shares of our stock year-to-date. This aligns with our messaging around prefunding our long-term future growth during the downturn and having the flexibility with the strong cash flow generation of the business to be opportunistic with share repurchases as a way to return value to our shareholders.\nWe will be disciplined in our capital allocation approach with investing in the business as priority #1, sustaining our investment-grade balance sheet, supporting future dividend growth and finally, continuing our opportunistic repurchases.\nLast quarter, we outlined our lowering our cost to serve initiative to remove $100 million of structural costs from the business. I'm happy to share we are off to a good start, having eliminated greater than $20 million in the quarter. Examples of our success are in service efficiencies, balancing our networks, dynamically serving customers to meet their needs, focusing even more on discretionary spending and driving greater asset utilization.\nWe remain committed to updating you on our progress going forward, but our intent is to demonstrate our progress in our reported results rather than just speak to them. As we noted last quarter, we will realize a portion of these benefits this year with the majority of the impact realized in 2026.\nLet me close with this and what I hope you take away from our quarter. First, our company continues to execute from a position of strength. We have been transparent with our strategy and our investments to be best prepared to service our customers' future capacity needs. Second, we also continued to remove structural cost from the business. We are off to a good start, but have more work to do. Third, our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash, and we remain focused on generating strong returns with our deployed capital. We have been opportunistic with our share repurchases and all while maintaining modest leverage on our balance sheet. That concludes my remarks. Now I'd like to turn it over to Spencer.\n\nSpencer Frazier\n\nExecutive Vice President of Sales & Marketing\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our view of the market and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. Overall demand trended below normal seasonality for much of the quarter outside of the seasonal lift we saw at quarter end. On the supply side, truckload capacity continued to exit the market and the pace of exits is accelerating. -- but the soft demand environment is likely muting the market impact of capacity attrition. Outside of recent weeks, truckload spot rates remained under pressure in the quarter. More recent regulatory developments, and more importantly, regulatory enforcement is having an impact on capacity.\nWhile this industry may have a chicken little reputation when it comes to predicting capacity changes, the capacity bubble may be deflating as we speak. In the near term, customers will remain skeptical of any predicted change only believing it when they experience it.\nShifting to intermodal, volumes declined 1% year-over-year. We believe our volumes held up better relative to the broader truckload market decline, primarily because more customers are converting freight to intermodal from the highway, as they see our commitment to operational excellence differentiating J.B. Hunt Intermodal from the competition. The service we provide ranks us at the top of our customer scorecards, and we continue to be ranked at the top of industry surveys as well with a Net Promoter Score of 53.\nWhen we go to market, we work with customers to dynamically solve their supply chain needs by designing and executing our operations to meet their requirements. For example, in our intermodal business, customers trust us to select the most efficient service regardless of the rail provider to seamlessly move their freight throughout North America. Today, roughly half of our interchange volume on transcontinental shipments occurs through a steel wheel interchange. This ratio can change dynamically and demonstrates our ability to be agile at scale to execute and meet our customer expectations. Regardless about the rail landscape and operating scenarios might change over the next couple of years, we remain committed to delivering exceptional service and growing with our customers.\nRegarding the current peak season, the strong container volume into the West Coast in July generated headlines regarding a potential pull forward. Ocean peak season came early. That said, it is important to disconnect the timing of peak season on the water from peak season of the inland supply chain. Our customers are still expecting a peak season. although the magnitude and duration of peak volumes will vary. Our conversations indicate there is a large amount of freight that was imported early that hasn't moved through the inland supply chain yet. No one has canceled Christmas.\nI'll close with some customer feedback. Our customers realize the financial health of the transportation industry is not great. And as a result, they are choosing to do more with the best carriers and more with less carriers. Shippers are focused on creating efficiencies in our supply chains by working with providers who are safe and financially sound and to execute with agility and predictability. Our scroll of services continues to operate from a position of strength, creating value as the go-to transportation provider for our customers.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our areas of focus across our operations, followed by an update on our final mile truckload and brokerage businesses. I'll start on our safety performance. Safety is a core piece of our culture and a key differentiator of our value proposition in the market. We are coming off of 2 consecutive years of record performance measured by DOT preventable accidents per million miles and our safety results through the third quarter are performing even better than these record performances. This performance is a testament to our people and the attention to detail we bring to the job every day as well as our focus on proper training and technology. Our safety performance is a key piece of driving out cost and will continue to be an area of focus.\nWhile the ultimate impact on industry capacity is hard to pinpoint, we believe the recent developments on regulations and enforcement when taken together could have a noticeable impact on available industry capacity. These include new regulations around English language proficiency, B1 BSS, FMCSA biometric ID verification and nondomiciled CDLs. Importantly, for J.B. Hunt, we do not expect to see any material impact on our capacity, but there have been some signs based on what we are seeing in our truck and brokerage operations that it could have a broader industry impact.\nMoving to the business. Let's start with the final mile. As we said last quarter, business conditions in our end markets remain challenged with soft demand for furniture, exercise equipment and appliances. We continue to see positive demand in our fulfillment network driven by off-price retail. Going forward, we expect market conditions to remain challenged through at least year-end. Our focus remains on providing the highest service levels being safe and secure, ensuring that the value we provide in the market is realized to drive appropriate returns. In 2026, we do anticipate losing some legacy appliance-related business, but we will be working diligently on backfilling with other brands and service offerings in this segment of our business.\nMoving to JBT. Our focus in this business hasn't changed, and we are winning business with strong service from both new and existing customers, leading to our highest quarterly volume in over a decade. We are remaining disciplined with our growth to ensure our network remains balanced in order to drive the best utilization of our trailing assets. Going forward, we are pleased with the direction of this business in this soft demand environment and the progress we are making on lowering our cost to serve. We see an opportunity for further efficiency and automation gains in the future as we continue to leverage our 360 platform. That said, meaningful improvements in our profitability in this business will be driven by greater levels of rate improvement and overall demand for truckload drop trailing solutions.\nI'll close with ICS. During the third quarter, volumes modestly improved sequentially as new volume from recent bid wins was partially offset by soft demand in the overall truckload market. Truckload spot rates remain depressed throughout the quarter, and we saw gross margins remain healthy. We are almost through bid season and are pleased with the awards we have received with rates up low to mid-single digits and winning volume with new customers. Our focus here remains on profitable growth with the right customers where we can differentiate ourselves with service.\nGoing forward, we remain focused on scaling into our investments while continuing to make improvements to our cost structure and leveraging our 360 platform to drive greater efficiency and automation, which will help lower our cost to serve. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brad.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll provide an update on our dedicated results. Starting with the quarter. At a high level, our third quarter results were very strong, particularly in light of this challenging freight environment. We believe our results are a testament to the strength and diversification of our model, the value we create for our customers and how we drive accountability at each site and customer location. As a result, we continue to see good demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions. During the third quarter, we sold approximately 280 trucks of new deals. As a reminder, our annual net sales target is for 800 to 1,000 new trucks per year, and we would be on pace with this target absent the known losses we disclosed almost 2 years ago.\nEncouragingly, our overall sales pipeline remains strong as our value proposition in the market remains differentiated. Our sales cycle in Dedicated is typically 18 months from start to finish and our pipeline includes both large and small fleets at various stages of completion, all underwritten to our return targets.\nOverall, I remain pleased with the momentum and activity in the pipeline. As I just mentioned and as we have communicated over the past 18 months, we have had visibility to fleet losses that wrapped up in early July, which negatively impacted our third quarter '25 truck count by about 85 trucks versus our second quarter results. Navigating through these losses, in addition to callouts we've had related to some customer bankruptcies and the overall market dynamics demonstrates our discipline and strong execution.\nWhile we were losing locations that had historically delivered mature margins, we were simultaneously absorbing startup costs from onboarding new business. Despite facing these 2 margin pressures, we still maintain double-digit margins during this period. I am extremely proud of all of our teams for their efforts.\nOur hope going forward, knowing that most of our fleet losses are behind us, is that we are back on track with our net fleet growth plan moving forward. We believe the performance of our dedicated business has been a standout not only for our company but also the industry. We have great visibility into the financial performance of each account, which provides a high level of accountability at each location and a diversified customer base with our managers on site with our customers, which we believe creates unique value that is a differentiator for us.\nGoing forward, with our known losses behind us, our expectation for modest fleet growth in 2025 has not changed. As we have said previously, when we sell new truck deals and that business starts up, we do incur some expenses as that business is onboarded. That said, this isn't new for us as we are starting up new customer locations each quarter. Given our progress with respect to lowering our cost to serve, we expect our 2025 operating income to be approximately flat compared to 2024. The magnitude of any potential variance, higher or lower to this outlook, will be driven by the number of locations we start up during the quarter. We believe the setup is favorable for us to continue our growth trajectory in 2026 and beyond. Our business model and value proposition are differentiated in the market and continues to attract new customers. We remain confident in our ability to compound our growth over many years to further penetrate our large addressable market. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to start by saying I feel really good about our performance and how our strategy and solid execution drove meaningful improvements in our results. I believe this is a true testament to our focus on operational excellence, cost discipline and progress on lowering our cost to serve initiative.\nBefore we get into more detail on the results, I want to follow up on some of Shelley's comments regarding the potential for Class I rail consolidation. First, there are still a lot of unknowns but I am confident J.B. Hunt should be a primary consideration and actively engaged in all discussions involving the future of the intermodal industry as well as the execution of all Class 1's desire to take share from the highway to grow their intermodal service offering. We have offered seamless Transcontinental intermodal services for decades, connecting BNSF with both Eastern railroads and believe that opportunity could exist well into the future regardless of the various outcomes we know are either announced or speculated in the market.\nWe continue to see a large opportunity to convert highway shipments to intermodal. And if the motivation for consolidation is to compete more with trucks, we believe this will present our industry-leading intermodal franchise additional growth opportunities. We are one of the largest purchasers of rail capacity in North America, and we will engage in discussions with all rail providers to execute on a strategy and plan that we think is in the best interest of our shareholders.\nTurning to the quarter. Demand for our domestic intermodal service wasn't all that strong. But nonetheless, we saw sequential improvement in volumes and executed some of the most efficient dray service in our history. Particularly in September. As Spencer mentioned, we still expect the peak season as lots of volume that moved down the water earlier this year will still need to advance in the inland supply chain ahead of the holidays. Volumes in the quarter were down 1% year-over-year and by month were down 3% in July, down 2% in August and flat in September. After seeing unique strength off the West Coast last year due to the threat of the East Coast port labor disruption, transcon volumes were down 6% in the quarter, while Eastern loads were up 6%.\nAs we've communicated all year, we had a bid season strategy focused on getting better balance in our network to grow volumes and repair our margins with more price, particularly in our head haul lanes. Last quarter, we talked about our success in the bid season, particularly around balance, and we think that success, combined with our -- lowering our cost to serve initiatives were key contributors to our year-over-year and sequential performance improvement.\nOur service performance remains strong. Our primary rail providers, BNSF, NS and CSX continued to deliver excellent service, which we believe is taking share from highway. I am confident our service offering is being recognized in the market. Customers are reengaging with us with additional opportunities largely driven by our differentiated service offering and value compared to both highway and IMCs.\nAs you all are keenly aware, we have the capacity and ability to execute on a meaningful growth plan over the coming years based on investments we've already made. In closing, we remain very confident in our intermodal franchise and the value we provide for our customers. We have shown the ability to grow and generate strong returns through many rail consolidation events over the past few decades and look forward to the opportunities we have in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions."

Hunt Transport Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Dalco, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, our CFO, John Kuhlow; Spencer Fraser, EVP of Sales and Marketing; our COO and President of Highway Services and Final Mile, Nick Hobbs; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Dedicated Contract Services.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. Members of the leadership team are here to dive into those areas, but I want to start by recognizing the entire organization for their hard work and ability to adapt to this dynamic market. I remain highly confident that our work is building a stronger company, capable of capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities ahead. We set out to accomplish this by staying true to our values, mission and vision and maintaining our focus on operational excellence, scaling into investments in our people, technology and capacity, and continuing to repair our margins and drive stronger financial performance, which remains a top priority.\nService levels across our businesses are excellent and customers have recognized us in both internal and external surveys. Our brand is strong in the market. Our excellent service is supporting our growth with both new and existing customers that will help us scale into our investments. Investments in our people have resulted in back-to-back years of record safety performance for the company and some of the lowest turnover metrics on record for our drivers. We have invested in technology to drive efficiencies in our business, and I've challenged the organization to think differently about our workflows and processes to drive even more.\nFinally, we have prefunded our trailing capacity needs in intermodal and are prepared to support our customers' future growth. These investments set us up well for our future.\nWhile we are preparing for future growth, we remain focused in the near term on repairing our margins and improving our financial performance. We expect the returns on our investments to match the strong and unique value we create for our customers. As you've heard me say, we remain focused on controlling what we can with our expenses in the near term without sacrificing our long-term opportunity, or said differently, preserving our future earnings power potential.\nLast quarter, we mentioned more work in the area of cost actions. Across the company, we launched an initiative to lower our cost to serve. John Kuhlow will have more details on this work, but at a high level, this effort is centered around doing more with less to support our future growth and get us back to our long-term margin targets. I have confidence in this team to lower our cost to serve and to leverage our brand and our role of services in the market. We completed Intermodal bid season with positive pricing for the first time in 2 years and continue to gain market share with capacity to grow more. Our dedicated business remains resilient. And with the fleet losses subsiding, we're excited to return to fleet growth in this business.\nWe have a solid model in JBT and FMS with significant growth opportunities we are going after. Our brokerage business still has work to do, but progress is being made to further rightsize the cost structure while growing with the right customers and freight. Market dynamics remain uncertain, but we will stay disciplined in our actions and maintain a position of strength. We have exceptional service levels, a rock-solid balance sheet with minimal leverage and available capacity at the ready for future growth.\nWe will continue to focus on the long term while taking steps in the near term to improve the return profiles of our business, all with the same mission, to drive long-term value for our people, customers and shareholders.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review the second quarter, provide some details on the lowering of our cost to serve initiative and give an update on our capital allocation. As a general overview, and consistent with recent quarters, our results for the quarter highlight the strength and resiliency of our business in the face of a challenging and unpredictable environment, generating over $225 million of free cash flow in the quarter. While we continue to focus on operational excellence, driving productivity and managing our costs, inflationary pressures, primarily in wages, insurance, both casualty and medical, and equipment costs more than offset those efforts and weighed on margins versus the prior year period.\nStarting with second quarter results. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue was flat, operating income decreased 4% and diluted earnings per share was less than 1% below the prior year quarter. The declines were primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures across the business, notably in casualty and group medical claims expense, and higher professional driver wages and equipment-related costs. These were partially offset by productivity and cost initiatives and a 5% lower average diluted share count versus the prior year period.\nWhile the recent tax bill remains under review, we continue to expect our tax rate to be between 24% and 25% and likely towards the higher end of that range.\nRegarding costs, we have been managing costs aggressively since the freight downturn began over 3 years ago. We've managed headcount through attrition and performance management, driven productivity in our operations and eliminated discretionary spending that ultimately wouldn't jeopardize our future earnings power nor our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities. Earlier this year, we challenged ourselves to do more in an effort to accelerate improvement in our financial performance, create greater operating leverage for the company when market dynamics turn and help support our future growth. Each executive focused on 1 or 2 of a total of 14 different areas across the business to identify opportunities to lower our cost to serve. The results of this initiative resulted in $100 million of identified annual cost to eliminate. These costs fall across 3 main areas: efficiency and productivity, asset utilization and technology and engineered process improvements. And we are not done. We continue to expand on these initiatives, and we'll provide updates on our progress in the quarters to come. While some of these benefits will be realized this year, most will impact 2026 and beyond.\nI'll wrap up with a quick update on our capital allocation and priorities. For 2025, we are now expecting net capital expenditures to fall between $550 million and $650 million, effectively tightening the range compared to our prior view of $500 million to $700 million. As previously discussed, we have prefunded much of our future growth and capacity needs. So our capital spend this year is primarily for replacement and with success-based needs we have in our Dedicated segment. Our balance sheet remains strong, in line with our targeted leverage of 1x trailing EBITDA, and we continue to generate strong cash flow and expect this to continue. Our primary use of cash has been managing our leverage and returning value to shareholders through our dividend and repurchasing stock. We remain focused on deploying capital to generate the highest returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, we repurchased $319 million of stock, which is a quarterly record for the company.\nThis concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Spencer.\n\nSpencer Frazier\n\nExecutive Vice President of Sales & Marketing\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our view of the market and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. During the quarter, overall customer demand trended modestly below normal seasonality as customers adapted to changes in global trade policy, the timing and direction of freight flows were impacted. That said, demand for our Intermodal service remains strong. We continue to see customers convert more freight to Intermodal from the highway as our commitment to operational excellence, keeping freight secure and our strong safety record differentiates us from the competition.\nIn our brokerage and truck segments, demand followed more normal seasonal patterns, including some market tightness in May around the annual road check event. However, the market tightness was relatively short-lived, and truckload spot rates remain soft, suggesting the truckload market, while close to equilibrium, continues to experience some excess capacity. This leads me into some feedback we are hearing from customers around their capacity and service. Customers recognize this cycle is long and ultimately will change. Their conversations with us focus on how to dynamically optimize their supply chain and capacity plans to meet their service needs and budgetary requirements. Customizing our [indiscernible] of services in changing markets has positioned us to be their go-to transportation provider that can deliver differentiating value.\nRegarding service, all of our businesses, and most importantly our people, have been recognized with multiple service awards from our customers. This translates to realizing some of our highest customer retention numbers in the last 5 years, more strategic discussions during the bid process and opportunities for additional freight after bid implementation.\nI'll close with some comments on trade policy, demand and peak. When we meet with customers, how they are adapting to trade policy remains top of mind. However, accurately forecasting demand is their biggest challenge. Our customer base is diverse, both in terms of size and industry. And each customer continuously adjust their supply chains to meet their unique needs. Recent examples are some customers of pull freight forward, some continue to execute demand-driven strategies and others are making changes to their country of origin and manufacturing plans. This added complexity, lack of accurate forecasts and potential for volatility is why our peak season surcharge programs are starting earlier this year.\nRegardless of customer strategy and the shape of peak season, we will be ready to meet their demand when it occurs. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our areas of focus across our operations, followed by an update on our Final Mile, Truckload and Brokerage businesses. I'll start on our safety performance. A key portion of our company's focus on operational excellence and driving out cost is our safety performance, which is core to our culture. We are coming off of 2 consecutive years of record performance measured by DOT preventable accidents per million miles, and our safety results are performing in line with these record performances. We continue to focus on driving improvements in our performance through proper training and technology to improve safety for our people and the motoring public while we effort to lower our cost. There has been a lot of recent discussion in the industry around some trucking regulations such as English language proficiency, the improper use of B1 visas to haul freight in the U.S. or cavitize and the new FMCSA biometric ID verification for trucking authorizations.\nWhile we could only guess the impact this might have on industry capacity for J.B. Hunt, we do not expect to see material impact.\nMoving to the business. I'll start with Final Mile. The end markets in this business remain challenged with demand for big and bulky products, still muted with soft demand for furniture, exercise equipment and appliances Demand in our fulfillment network was positive again this quarter, driven by off-price retail. Going forward, our focus remains on continuing to attract new customers to grow this business. That said, we believe recent market conditions will persist through at least year-end, driving our second half performance to look similar to our first half performance prior to any consideration for lowering our cost to serve initiatives.\nWe remain focused on providing the highest levels of service being safe and secure and ensuring that the value we provide in the market is realized to drive appropriate returns.\nMoving to JBT. Our focus in this business hasn't changed. We are working to methodically grow this while remaining disciplined on network balance to drive the best utilization of our trailing assets. This season was competitive this year as it always is, but we are pleased with our success retaining our business, getting modest rate increases and winning new business with both new and existing customers as evidenced by our highest second quarter volume in over a decade. Going forward, we like the progress and direction of this business and the improvements we continue to make. That said, meaningful improvements in our profitability in this business will be driven by execution on lowering our cost to serve initiatives, rate improvement and overall demand for truckload drop trailing solutions.\nI'll close with ICS. During the second quarter, we saw fairly stable volumes and seasonality. The truckload market tightened around road check and felt like it remain tight a little longer than usual, which compressed our margins in May. That said, spot rates did soften, and we saw margins expand again in June. We are over halfway through the bid season, are pleased with the award so far with rates up low to mid-single digits and winning volume with new customers. Our focus here remains on profitable growth, targeting the right customers where we can differentiate ourselves with service while also diversifying our customer base. Compared to the second quarter last year, we've seen our small to midsize customer growth up 25%, which remains a focus, and our customer retention rate is near record levels. Going forward, we will remain focused on scaling into our investments while continuing to make improvements on our cost structure and our productivity.\nWith that, now I'd like to turn the call over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business and give an update on the market and our areas of focus. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, demand for our Intermodal service was strong and the business proved to be quite resilient in the face of a lot of uncertainties presented at the end of the first quarter. Volumes in the quarter were up 6% year-over-year, and by month, we're up 11% in April, up 3% in May and up 4% in June. As it pertains to mix, our Transcon volumes decreased 1% during the quarter and Eastern volume grew 15%. We want to continue to highlight the strength of our Eastern network volume growth. We compete more directly with truck in this market, and yet with low truck rates and lower fuel prices, we continue to see customers convert highway freight to Intermodal. This is a result of our combined strong service levels with our rail providers and how that translates into an attractive and valuable cost-saving alternative to truck for our customers.\nAs we wrap up our 2025 bid season, I will remind you of our 3-pronged strategy and provide some feedback on our performance. First, we wanted to focus on balancing our network, eliminating the cost to move empties and more efficiently utilize our trailing capacity. I believe we were most successful in this area of our strategy. Second, we wanted to grow with both new and existing customers. This growth is not just volume on an absolute basis, but share of wallet and converting customer freight from the highway to Intermodal. I believe we were also quite successful on this strategy while remaining disciplined with our pricing.\nFinally, we needed to get rate to help prepare our margins and cover our inflationary costs. To be fair, I don't know that we ever get as much as we want, but I would say we underperformed our expectations in this area. To be clear, we believe our overall book of business did reprice modestly higher year-over-year as we did achieve increases in our head haul lanes, partially offset by pressure in the backhaul lanes. We believe the results of this bid season, combined with our lowering our cost to serve initiatives can stabilize our margin performance and could be supportive of modest improvements going forward.\nAs a reminder, Q3 is typically the first full quarter that reflects the collective work of our bid season and will be with us through the first half of 2026.\nDuring the second quarter, we announced the launch of our Quantum service in Mexico. We have been growing this service-sensitive offering in the United States and are excited to bring this product to Mexico with our rail providers. Mexico has been the fastest-growing channel at J.B. Hunt, and we continue to see a long runway for growth in this market for many years to come.\nIn closing, we remain very confident in our Intermodal franchise and the value we provide for our customers. Our service levels are high, customers trust us, and we have both the capacity and capability to grow well into the future. We believe our performance continues to lead the industry while maintaining a heavy investment in capacity to support our future growth.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Brad.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll provide an update on our dedicated results. Starting with the quarter, at a high level, I believe our second quarter results were very strong, particularly in light of the prolonged challenging freight environment. We believe this is a testament to the strength and diversification of our model, the value we create for our customers and how we drive accountability at each site and customer location. As a result, we continue to see good demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions.\nDuring the second quarter, we sold approximately 275 trucks of new deals. As a reminder, our annual net sales target is for 800 to 1,000 new trucks per year. And through the first half of the year, we would be on pace with this target, absent the known losses we disclosed almost 2 years ago.\nEncouragingly, our sales pipeline remains strong as our value proposition in the market remains differentiated. As I just mentioned, we have had visibility to some fleet losses that we anticipated to wrap up during the second quarter. That has largely played out as expected, except the timing of the actual account closure rolled into early July. This positively impacted our 2Q '25 truck count by about 85 trucks versus our expectations we shared with you last quarter.\nGiven our strong sales pipeline, we continue to expect to see net fleet growth in the second half of the year. As is always the case, we remain disciplined on the type of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return targets and remain pleased with the activity and recent overall momentum. We believe the performance in our Dedicated business during the downturn has been a standout for our company and the industry and highlights the unique strength and resiliency of our model. We have a diverse customer base, both by industry and geography with managers on-site with our customers, executing their outsourced private fleet solution. We have great visibility into the financial performance of each account, which provides a high level of accountability at each location.\nGoing forward, we continue to expect to see some modest fleet growth in 2025, but the timing and magnitude of our net adds could impact our prior expectations for modest growth in operating income this year compared to 2024. This is a result of us typically incurring some startup costs when we onboard new business. We view this favorably, and this sets us up well to continue on our growth trajectory into 2026 and beyond. Our business model and value proposition are differentiated and continues to attract new customers despite the challenging market, and we are very confident in our ability to compound our growth over many years to further penetrate our large addressable market.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions."

Hunt Transport First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. .\nFor more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I am joined by our President and CEO, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Spencer Frazier, our EVP of Sales and Marketing; our COO and President of Highway Services and Final Mile, Nick Hobbs; Brad Hicks, President of Dedicated Contract Services; and Darren Field, President of Intermodal.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. The team will provide more details on each of our business segments, but at a high level, our results during the first quarter came in largely as we expected and as we shared with you back in January. I continue to be proud of the work of our team and remain confident that we have better positioned the company for future growth and success. We are seeing our service performance provide us benefits during this bid season. .\nSafety is core to our company's culture, and we continue to improve on our key metrics despite following 2 consecutive years, a record setting performance. We also remain focused and disciplined on our cost without sacrificing on our strategic investments in our people, technology and capacity. We are well positioned to scale into and leverage these investments as we grow in our large addressable markets served by our portfolio of services.\nAs we've shared, we are not pleased with our returns and efforts across the organization continue to reduce and eliminate costs, refine our capital plans and drive further productivity across our businesses. As I said last quarter, beginning to repair our margins and improve our financial performance remains a top priority for our leaders and our company. Looking ahead, while headlines are changing daily, our overall strategy and focus as an organization remains the same, be operationally excellent provide a valuable service for our customers that is critical to their business needs and scale into our strategic investments.\nThat said, our executive team has explored various options we might employ to more aggressively eliminate costs in some of our scenario-planning analysis. However, we are fortunate in that our assets move to where our demand for our services originate, so we will have to stay agile and make quick decisions if the market dynamics change. We will stay informed by our internal data, customer feedback and outlook and make decisions as needed to maximize long-term value for our shareholders.\nBefore turning this over to the team, I'll close with this. The strength of our business supported our investments during this challenging freight environment while meaningfully enhancing the future earnings potential of our company. While the timing of the market inflection still remains uncertain, we will exit from a position of strength, which is unique in our industry and becoming even more unique each day. We have proven our service levels and safety culture are unmatched.\nWe had record first quarter intermodal volumes. Dedicated continues to have industry-leading margins, and we're seeing signs of improvement in our highway businesses. Our brand is very strong with customers, and we have the talent, systems and capacity to support our future growth.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the first quarter, provide some additional details on our efforts to control costs and also give an update on capital allocation. As a general overview, our results for the quarter came in as expected and on the better side of the guidance range we had provided last quarter. That said, seasonally lower volume and rate pressure, coupled with inflationary cost headwinds more than offset our cost control and productivity improvements and weighed on margins versus the prior year period.\nStarting with first quarter results. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue declined 1%, operating income decreased 8% and diluted EPS decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. The declines were primarily driven by lower yields and inflationary cost pressures across the business with noticeable increases in insurance premiums for the third consecutive year. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be between 24% and 25%, with the cadence throughout the year similar to what we reported last year.\nOn the subject of cost, we have made progress to rightsize our cost structure across the business, and this remains an area of focus. Over the past 2 years, we have reduced our people costs by over $200 million through headcount attrition and performance management. That said, a portion of these savings have been offset by annual merit increases and higher benefit costs for our employees, particularly in the area of group medical costs.\nWhile the economic backdrop remains unpredictable, we remain focused on being cost disciplined without disrupting valuable aspects of our franchise, like our strong culture, experience across the field and preparedness to meet future customer needs. Our leadership team is consistently reviewing the business with our customer needs, and we will adapt to economic conditions as necessary.\nIn addition to managing our people costs and reducing discretionary spending, we have and will remain focused on improving equipment utilization, network balance and efficiencies and reducing events to mitigate claims cost. I'll wrap up with some thoughts on our capital allocation and priorities. First, I want to highlight that during the quarter, we issued $750 million of new senior notes, which extended the term on some of our debt that was maturing later this year.\nFor 2025, we are now expecting net capital expenditures to fall between $500 million to $700 million, below our prior view of $700 million to $900 million. Despite the continuation of a tough operating environment across the industry, we continue to operate from a position of financial strength with our leverage at target of 1x trailing EBITDA.\nSince we have prefunded much of our future capacity needs, our capital needs are really for replacement and success-based needs we have in our Dedicated segment. We expect to generate strong cash flows and put that cash to work to generate the highest returns for our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased $234 million of stock and have $650 million remaining on our current authorization. This now concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Spencer.\n\nSpencer Frazier\n\nExecutive Vice President of Sales & Marketing\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our view of the market and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. During the quarter, overall customer demand trended in line with normal seasonality giving consideration for an earlier Lunar New Year and the weather events that occurred in January and February. Demand for our intermodal service continued to be strong as our focus on operational excellence differentiates us from our competitors. This focus enabled us to safely execute and meet the expectations of our customers.\nIn our brokerage and truck segments, we saw some weather-induced tightness. However, the truckload market loosened as the quarter progressed. This suggests truckload capacity continues to exceed demand. Regardless of market and macro changes, one thing is certain, we will continue to focus on providing the best service and value for our customers. And this focus has benefited us during bid season, affording us additional opportunities to grow with customers while also getting some rate improvement.\nI'll close with some customer feedback. First, regarding service. Our customer sentiment is high, and we were honored with several awards during the quarter. Secondly, and not surprising, the uncertain macro environment and trade policy are top of mind for our customers. We recognize there are a lot of questions right now about how tariffs may impact the market. We believe they have the potential to impact both supply and demand, but the magnitude and timing is difficult to predict.\nOur customers continue to plan for multiple what-if scenarios, but most of them are waiting for the dust to settle to determine how tariffs might influence and change their short- and long-term business strategies. As part of this scenario-planning process, some customers are considering ways to alter supply chain freight flows and/or their country of origin sourcing. But these changes will be part of a much longer decision process.\nRegardless of the strategies they deployed, we believe we are executing from a position of strength. Across our suite of services, our brand has never been stronger. We've made the investments to support our customers' business, take share in the market and make appropriate long-term returns for our shareholders.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our areas of focus across our operations, followed by a quick update on our Highway and Final Mile businesses. I'll start with some comments on our safety performance. As Shelley mentioned, safety is core to our company's culture, and we are coming off of 2 straight years of record performance measured by DOT preventable accidents per million miles.\nI'm proud to say that through the first quarter, we have seen further improvement in our performance. During the first quarter, we also achieved another big safety accomplishment that we're proud to share. Our maintenance team in Cedar Rapids, Iowa achieved 1 million collective work hours without any injuries. This is an outstanding accomplishment that represents over 19 years of dedication and attention to detail to ensure safe, injury-free operations.\nShifting to the business. I'll start with Final Mile. Demand for big and bulky products remains muted with relatively weak demand for furniture, exercise equipment and appliances. That said, demand in our fulfillment network was positive, driven by off-price retail trends. Going forward, our focus remains on providing the highest level of service with a strong focus on being safe and secure as we deliver products to and on behalf of our customers.\nMoving to JBT. Our focus is on methodically growing this business while remaining disciplined on maintaining balance in our network to drive the best utilization of our [ trailing ] assets. Bid season is always competitive, and this year is no different, but we are relatively pleased with our success so far in terms of retaining business, getting some modest rate increases as well as winning new customers.\nOur service levels remain strong, and that has been noticed by our customers, which has resulted in additional bid opportunities compared to last year. Going forward, we like the progress and direction of the business and the improvements we continue to make, but meaningful improvement in our profitability will be driven by overall demand for truckload drop trailing solutions and our ability to fill excess capacity. I'll close with some comments on ICS. Our focus here remains on profitable growth targeting the right customers where we can differentiate ourselves with service while also diversifying our customer base.\nCompared to the first quarter last year, we've seen more than a 20% increase in our customer count. We're about 1/3 of the way through the bid season and are pleased with the award so far and have confidence that we will continue this momentum. Our gross margins performance held up well in the quarter as we managed our purchase transportation costs, which will remain a focus while also continuing to drive efficiency in and cost out of our operations. Going forward, we will remain focused on scaling into our investments with both new and existing customers while making improvements on our cost and our productivity.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Brad.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our dedicated results, review our pipeline and how we focus on operational excellence in our business. I'll start with the quarter. At a high level, the first quarter played out as expected despite the challenging operating environment. Weather did impact us slightly more than we considered normal, particularly in the Southeast, but we were able to recover some of that impact.\nAdditionally, we have not seen as much of a spring surge with our lawn and garden customers, which could be delayed as we experienced a subseasonal lift from February into March across the portfolio. At this point, we think it's too early to tell if this is a seasonal shift or less inventory being pushed out to stores. Nonetheless, the team did a great job of managing our costs and resources to deliver value for our customers.\nOverall demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up relatively well in the market. We sold approximately 260 trucks of new deals during the first quarter. As a reminder, our annual net sales target is 800 to 1,000 new trucks per year. While our pipeline remains strong, as we have said for several quarters, we have visibility to some fleet losses throughout the second quarter. Our value proposition to customers remain strong as the cost and complexity of managing and running your own private fleet continues to rise.\nAs a reminder, we have a long contracting process that typically takes about 18 months to close. Admittedly, we have seen some customers take a little longer to execute contracts as they are taking a more wait-and-see approach with some of the uncertainty in the market. As is always the case, we remain disciplined on the type of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return targets, and we'd still say we are pleased with the activity and recent sales we've been able to close. We believe our performance in our dedicated business during the downturn has been a standout and highlights the strength and resiliency of our model.\nWe have a diverse set of customers by both industry and geography with the average size of our deals remaining relatively small. With over 25% of our business serving food-related industries, we also see consistency and stability across the portfolio. Our big focus right now, aside from our customer value delivery activities is a strong focus on safety, which, as Nick mentioned, is core to our culture.\nIt is important to our drivers, the motoring public and also is our best risk and cost mitigator in the current environment. Going forward, we continue to expect to return to net fleet growth in 2025, but the timing of when deals sign and close will largely drive our ability to return to modestly positive revenue and operating income growth for 2025. We believe our differentiated model and the value proposition we offer customers is unique and are confident in our ability to compound our growth over many years to further penetrate our large addressable market.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'll review the performance of the intermodal business and give an update on the market and how we are focusing on operational excellence. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, demand for our Intermodal service was strong as we expected in the quarter. I am pleased to share we set a first quarter volume record, which comes on the heels of 2 consecutive all-time volume records in the second half of last year.\nVolumes in the quarter were up 8% year-over-year and by month were up 9% in January, up 6% in February and up 7% in March. As it pertains to mix, our Transcon volumes increased 4% during the quarter and Eastern volume grew 13%, our third consecutive quarter of positive Eastern network performance. We also saw very strong volumes in our Mexico business, a market in which we see significant opportunities in the future.\nI remain encouraged by our demand, particularly in the Eastern network where we faced the greatest competition from depressed truck rates. This is a testament to the strong service levels of the rails and how that translates into an attractive and valuable alternative to truck for our customers. We came into bid season this year with a 3-pronged strategy, and I would say we are mildly pleased with our success so far.\nWe know our margins need repair and rates will be a large driver of that. But the degree of rate repair will be somewhat market dependent. While we are still in bid season and have some large bids that will be awarded over the next couple of months, we have had only modest success in repairing rates while retaining existing business. Second, we were focused on achieving more network balance and winning the right freight for our network.\nThis is an example of ways we can reduce cost and drive efficiencies by eliminating the costly movement of empty containers. We have been more successful executing on this part of the strategy. Lastly, as in the case each year, we want to grow with new and existing customers while remaining disciplined with our rates. As a result, we have lost some business to other providers offering lower rates, but I believe we have still been successful in this third prong of our strategy to grow our overall portfolio.\nOur focus on operational excellence continues to be on delivering value to our customers and positioning the business for future growth and acceptable returns on our investment. We remain focused on driving out waste and improving asset utilization by working to eliminate empty moves of our equipment. We also are strongly committed to further improving our safety performance to mitigate risks and costs associated with safety events.\nIn closing, we remain confident in our Intermodal franchise and the value we provide for our customers. We have the capacity and capability to grow into our investments while continuing to lead the industry in both margin performance and returns on capital. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to give instructions for the Q&A portion."

My name is Abby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to J.B. Hunt's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may begin.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. While 2024 was a continuation of the challenging freight environment, I am proud of the work of our team and how we position the company for our future. We focus on providing excellent service to our customers, improving on our record-setting safety performance and remaining cost disciplined, all while leveraging our strategic investments in our people, technology and capacity. We have been in a period of heavy investment to better prepare ourselves to expand all aspects of our business in the future.\nOur commitment to our people in providing quality, differentiated service and capacity for our customers, particularly during another strong peak season, sets us up extremely well to scale into these investments ahead. Looking forward, the overall strategy and focus of our organization is on operational excellence and scaling into our investments. We are positioning the business for long-term growth that generates appropriate returns on capital that delivers long-term value for our shareholders.\nThe decisions we made to strategically hold on to our people and capacity through the freight recession and make some bold investments like acquiring the intermodal assets from Walmart were made through that lens and has only enhanced our future earnings potential. That said, while our performance has held up relatively well in this difficult environment, we aren't satisfied with the current results of our business, particularly around margins and returns on capital, a focus and a top priority for our leaders in the company to get us on a path to repair and improve our financial performance. My confidence in this team and our ability to leverage our brand and our services coming off of another strong year of service execution and safety is extremely high. We've executed on 2 consecutive quarters of record intermodal volumes, with capacity to grow more, while we focus on repricing our larger book of business. Our dedicated business has been remarkably resilient, and has solid visibility to future growth. We still have work to do in our brokerage business and progress is being made, but I see lots of opportunity to scale that business ahead, and I'll let Nick provide some color on the plan there. And our JBT and Final Mile businesses have a good model, and we see plenty of opportunities for growth ahead.\nWhile market dynamics remain uncertain around the timing and magnitude of a potential inflection, our focus in 2025 is to grow and begin to repair our margins. We will be coming out of the freight recession from a position of strength. We believe the value we create for our customers with our capacity and our exceptional service levels are unique in the market and that our return should mirror this value. We and our customers know this.\nWe stand ready to continue to expand with our customers and to add new customers under the J.B. Hunts. The team will have more commentary on each area business, but in closing, we have proven our service levels and our safety culture are unmatched and have available capacity ready for future growth. We will continue to focus on the long term while taking steps in the near term to improve the return profiles of our business, all with the same mission to drive long-term value for our people, customers and shareholders.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and year. Some additional color on our cost control efforts as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2025. As a general overview, we saw signs of seasonality across the business and experienced a strong intermodal peak season. That said, the inflationary rate environment, coupled with an inflationary cost environment, weighed on margins versus the prior year.\nStarting with fourth quarter results. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 5%, operating income increased 2% and diluted earnings per share increased 4%. We did have insurance-related charges totaling $53.4 million in [ Q4 of '23 ] and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $16 million in Q4 of '24. The asset impairment charges this year are related to early termination of leased facilities and intangible assets recorded from the BNSF Logistics acquisition. After consideration of these charges, operating income and diluted earnings per share declined year-over-year, largely driven by the deflationary pricing environment.\nFor the full year 2024, on a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue declined 6%, operating income declined 16% and diluted EPS decreased 20%. These results include the impact of the previously mentioned charges pressure to continue in the areas of insurance premiums and people costs. Despite 2 consecutive years of record safety performance, our insurance premiums have more than doubled over that period due to the higher cost to resolve claims. This is an industry challenge and these inflationary costs will need to be passed on to shippers and eventually consumers.\nNow speaking specifically to the first quarter of 2025. Given normal seasonality on a sequential basis, we expect operating income to decline at a similar rate as what we saw in 2024 after consideration for the charges we disclosed, or more specifically somewhere around 20% to 25%. On the subject of cost, we have made progress across the business to rightsize our cost structure. In April 2024, we outlined $100 million of aggregate costs we were carrying across the company related to investments and resources in both our people and capacity. We also noted that we have visibility to these costs and where they live within the organization.\nSince this time, our headcount has been reduced through attrition and performance management and now sits approximately 12% below our peak levels. On the capacity side, we commented that we had about 20% excess capacity in both JBI and JBT. Since we made those comments in April, we did invest further in our capacity in JBI with the purchase of Walmart's intermodal assets. And while our business activity levels have increased, so too has our capacity. That said, we feel confident in our ability to generate a solid return on those investments over the useful life of those assets.\nAs it stands today, on a consolidated basis, the aggregate cost of that additional capacity is around $60 million. While progress has been made, we remain focused on controlling costs in the near term without reducing the long-term earnings power of our business. I'll wrap up with an initial look at our capital plan. For 2025, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $700 million and $900 million, which is up from the $674 million in 2024. Our first use of capital is always to invest in our business for growth. Through strategic decisions and opportunities in the market, we have prefunded a large portion of our future growth in JBI and as has historically been the case, our capital needs and DCS are success driven.\nOur other businesses require very little capital investment. We plan to continue to support our dividend in 2025, which has increased at this point for 20 consecutive years. Finally, we will continue to opportunistically repurchase stock as a means of returning value to shareholders. In 2024, we repurchased $514 million of stock at an average price of $169 per share. 2024 marks the second largest year for share repurchases in our company's history. With our modest leverage, limited near-term capital needs and view on where we are in the cycle, we think repurchases are a prudent use of capital at this time. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Spencer.\n\nSpencer Frazier\n\nExecutive Vice President of Sales & Marketing\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on the market, our sales objectives and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. In the fourth quarter, we saw a strong peak season materialize, particularly across our intermodal business as well as in our highway businesses. In intermodal, customer demand came in strong, and we were able to execute this higher volume while maintaining high levels of service for our customers.\nIn JBT and ICS, we experienced seasonal volume trends and some margin pressure in December as the market tightened, which is normal around the holiday period. Throughout peak season, we were in constant communication with our customers around their changing capacity needs. Given our strong value proposition around capacity and service, we were considered the go-to for our customers, while we see capacity exit the industry every day, overall, there is still some excess capacity available in the market. That said, some customers are securing capacity a little earlier than normal which has historically been a good indication that supply and demand dynamics are shifting.\nRegardless of market changes, our focus is on providing the best possible experience and service for our customers. Having a full suite of services to deliver optimal solutions for our customers is a strong and differentiated value proposition in the market. In 2025, we will continue to pursue operational excellence while providing an exceptional customer service. We believe that providing high-quality service and creating unique value for our customers is the right thing to do every time and foundational to grow in our business.\nWe create value for our customers, and that will continue to be our focus, but we also plan to have conversations with each customer to make sure we are getting paid appropriately for our investments and efforts. Coming off another peak season with solid execution and service, we are in the best position to have conversations with customers about the value we create for their business. I'll close with some feedback we're hearing from customers.\nFirst, we received very positive feedback on how we executed peak season, and we are already working on our plans for next fall. Secondly, each customer is unique in terms of size, industry and supply chain needs, which demand different strategies to execute their supply chains and mitigate potential disruptions. For example, we believe most of our customers are taking more of a wait-and-see approach to see how potential tariffs might influence future purchasing and business decisions.\nRegardless of their strategies, we believe we are in a strong position with our suite of services and the investments we've already made to support their work, take share in the market and make appropriate long-term returns. We remain focused on the long term while taking steps in the near term to improve the return profiles of our business, all with the same vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Nick. .\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our areas of focus across our operations. Before I begin my comments, I'd like to say I'm excited to be taking on the role as President of Highway Services and Final Mile. And so I will provide a quick update on those specific business. I'll start with some comments on safety and customer value delivery, or CVD. Our company is rooted in a foundation of safety and is at the core of what we do every day.\nI'm proud to say that 2024 was another record performance for us measured as DOT preventable accidents per million miles. This is the second consecutive year of record performance and a testament to our focus on continuously improving in this area. Our safety performance is just 1 example of our focus on customer value delivery or CVD that we continue to roll out across the organization. As Shelley mentioned in her remarks, we have been very focused on operational excellence across the organization, improving the value we create for our customers through our CVD process. We believe this puts us in the best position to retain and grow our business while ensuring our customers see and appreciate the value we are creating for them. Shifting more specifically to the businesses, I'll start with JBT. Our focus remains on attracting the right freight for our drop trailer network while ensuring capacity is correctly positioned across the network to serve this freight efficiently.\nOur service level remains strong, and we continue to look to methodically grow this business while maintaining network balance, which will support future growth while driving efficiency and greater profitability. On Final Mile, demand for big and bulky products remain muted with soft demand in furniture and modestly soft trends in exercise equipment and appliances. We continue to focus on providing high levels of service differentiating ourselves in the market and ensuring we are appropriately paid for the great work we do. I'll close with some comments on our strategy in ICS.\nThe past couple of years have been challenging in ICS, but I believe we are in a more solid base to build off of going forward. In 2024, we incurred quite a bit of expense related to the integration of BNSF Logistics acquisition. This year that will not repeat in 2025 to the tune of $35 million. This includes the impairment charge John referenced earlier. Going forward, with our base business on a more solid footing, and the integration behind us, our focus turns to growth and more specifically, growth with the right customers.\nWe need to further diversify our customer base in terms of size as well as industry, really targeting businesses that we can differentiate ourselves with our service, people and technology. We are implementing some of the playbook we utilized and dedicated to help us generate better leads and customers that we believe will see the value in what service we offer. We have better alignment with our sales resources and the strategy we are confident that sets us up to scale the investments we've made in the business overall.\nWe are already seeing some momentum as volumes and customer counts have been growing the past 2 quarters. Finally, we are continuing our focus on controlling costs. The team has made significant progress in rightsizing our cost structure but there are still opportunities for additional improvement. As we come out of this recessionary freight environment, we will focus on leveraging our investments to drive greater productivity.\nI'm excited about the work we are doing within ICS and believe we have a long runway of growth and the ability to scale quickly in this business. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into my prepared comments on our Dedicated business, I'd just like to say how excited I'm to be leading us in this area. I recently celebrated my 29th anniversary at the company and having spent 25 of those years in our dedicated business, in some ways, it feels like a homecoming. While we have had a lot of success in the business, I feel a strong sense of responsibility to continue to expand on our performance and accelerate our growth.\nAs we have talked about in the past and Nick his hit on previously, we focused our dedicated business on providing professional, outsourced private fleet solutions for our customers. We believe our performance during the downturn has been a standout in the market and highlights the strength and resiliency of our model. We have a diverse set of customers by both industry and geography with the average size of our deals remaining relatively small. With this diversification and also having a decentralized model, we have great visibility into our performance, which drives strong accountability both for the benefit of our customers and financial management. We continue to see considerable opportunity for future growth with a qualified addressable market of approximately $90 billion. We are pleased with our pipeline and the opportunities we see across a diverse set of customers and industries.\nWe've maintained our disciplined underwriting standards on new business, and I am pleased to report on another strong quarter of new truck sales. We sold just shy of 440 trucks of new business in the quarter. 2024 marked one of our best truck sales years in our history, a strong statistic considering the environment. This only reinforces our belief in our value proposition to our customers, further supported by our customer value delivery process that Nick just touched on.\nI'd like to take a second to review our performance in 2024 and maybe set the stage for 2025 and our view of our future opportunity. A little over a year ago, we spoke about having visibility to some fleet losses, and we certainly combated that challenge throughout the year. We also saw some pressure with customer bankruptcies and to a lesser extent, some competition on a small portion of our portfolio. We sit here today with visibility to some of the fleet loss pressure continuing through the early part of the second quarter. That said, with our sales momentum and strong pipeline, we feel fairly good about our ability to return to net fleet growth in 2025.\nAs we discussed before, we do typically incur some start-up expense with newly launched businesses, like given the average life of our contracts remain around 5 years, we recover that investment over the life of the deal. This is all embedded in our underwriting process. Excluding some of the noise around fleet losses in 2024, our base business, so excluding the start-up drag from the new ads, did operate within our stated margin target range of 12% to 14%.\nAs we progress through 2025, we look forward to the fleet losses abating and returning to our long-term growth trajectory, which we target to be about 800 to 1,000 trucks per year on a net basis. With this as the backdrop for 2025, we expect top line and operating income growth this year will likely be modest. In closing and looking forward, the playbook and [ play calls ] remain the same. Execute with operational excellence, drive additional value for our customers through our CVD process and continue to invest in our people to help support and accelerate our growth.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter and give an update on the market and service performance. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, we saw the momentum from the third quarter continue into the fourth quarter, with total volume up 5% year-over-year. Sequentially, we outperform normal seasonality as the fourth quarter set a new quarterly record for intermodal volume.\nIn fact, in the quarter, we had the largest intermodal volume month ever surpassing 200,000 loads in October, our largest volume week and our largest volume outbound Southern California. By month, intermodal volumes were up 4% in October, 7% in November and 3% in December. As it pertains to mix, our Transcon volumes increased 4% during the quarter and Eastern volume grew 6%. I remain encouraged by volume growth in the East despite depressed truck rates which is a testament to the strong service levels of the rails and how that translates into attractive and valuable alternative to truck for our customers.\nGoing forward, we continue to see a lot of opportunities for future volume growth given the attractive economics and environmental benefits of intermodal versus a truck alternative. During the quarter, we experienced a strong peak season where we were able to meet the elevated demand of our customers while maintaining high service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network. For a few weeks early in the quarter, rail service in the West modestly deteriorated as the railroad experienced record intermodal demand.\nIn order to fulfill our service promise to customers during this time, we had to do some unnatural activities to help keep the rail network fluid. While rail service was restored to normal after a few weeks, the additional costs we incurred more than offset the benefit of incremental volume in our network and put pressure on our margins. Going forward, as a reminder of our pricing cadence, we will be living with the vast majority of our current pricing through the first half of 2025. We are in the early innings of our bid season, and it is too early to comment on the outlook of bid results.\nThat said, due to inflationary cost pressure across our business and the deflationary pricing experienced over the last 2 years, we will need to correct our pricing while remaining focused on our cost to return our business to reinvestable levels. We are entering this bid season from a position of strength having just successfully executed our second peak season with high service levels, and our available capacity was able to handle strong customer surge demand.\nThe improvement in customer bid compliance also gives us greater visibility for opportunities to fill in lane imbalances across our network to drive greater efficiency. In closing, we sit here today at or near the end of the worst freight recession we have ever experienced, having just reported 2 consecutive quarters of record intermodal volume. As we look forward, we see more opportunities for volume growth coupled with opportunities to improve our margin performance. While our margin performance has been under pressure, it is not at acceptable reinvestable levels for us. We continue to lead the industry in both margins and returns.\nOur focus in 2025 is on growing into our available capacity and beginning to repair our margins by ensuring that the value we create for our customers is realized and captured. We strongly believe in the strength and value of our intermodal franchise. We have the people, technology and capacity in the network for growth and remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient cost competitive and more environmentally friendly solution.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, so I'll turn it over to the operator to give instructions for the Q&A portion of the call"

My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the J.B. Hunt Transport Services Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may begin.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nFor more information regarding key risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Spencer Frazier, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; our COO and President of Contract Services, Nick Hobbs; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services and Executive Vice President of People.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to start by saying I'm humbled and honored to have recently assumed the role as CEO and to lead our great company on the next phase of our growth journey.\nWhile recognizing this is a big moment, as only the fifth organizational leader in our company's [ 62 ] year history, let me be clear, our vision, our mission and our focus has not changed. We have large addressable markets. We provide excellent service for customers. We have talented people across our organization. We are prime, and we are ready to execute on our opportunities for growth. My message to the team on day one was quite simple, ready, set, go.\nAs you've heard us say consistently, we remain committed to our investments and managing the business with a long-term mindset. These investments span across our company foundations, which include our people, our technology and our capacity. Through investments in these key areas, we have a significant number of opportunities to provide value to and on behalf of our customers across our suite of complementary service offerings. Our focus remains on deploying capital in areas of the transportation industry where we see a long-term opportunity to generate compounding returns.\nWe operate in an industry that is cyclical, but we have focused on businesses and areas that we feel confident we can compete effectively, take share and win. We do this by remaining [indiscernible] discipline, keeping our focus on the long term while managing costs in the near term and relying on our vast experience. We will be prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers while driving long-term growth for the company and our shareholders.\nEarlier this year, we introduced our priorities for 2024, and we as a management team and as an organization continue to execute on these priorities which as a reminder are: one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence; two, [ instill ] a long-term investment in our company foundations, which are people, technology and capacity; and three, drive long-term value and returns for our shareholders. While the first half of this year has been challenging in terms of our financial performance, we remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers.\nIn 2024, we've continued our record performance in safety and our service levels to customers has been exceptional. We have received multiple awards this year for our high service level from our customers. Our joint intermodal service offering with BNSF, Quantum, is running well above our initial expectation from an on-time service performance.\nIn Dedicated, we continue to improve our value to customers as we've been able to balance the need to be disciplined with underwriting new business while providing customers some flexibility with meeting their needs. Final Mile continues to make progress on its profit improvement plan and we continue to work on areas around cost, integration and growth in ICS and see some progress in the business. Finally, we remain encouraged about the value proposition for customers in our drop trailing business in JBT and the future potential of that business.\nWhile admittedly, the market has been challenging, we have invested throughout this downturn to set us up for future growth and success across the business. We continue to focus on controlling expenses in the near term without jeopardizing our long-term potential, managing our head count through attrition while at the same time, continuing to deploy and enhance our technology to increase the productivity of our people. We took advantage of a strategic opportunity to acquire the intermodal assets for Walmart earlier this year. which added capacity to our network, but also increase the long-term growth potential of our company, which we believe will drive long-term returns for both the company and our shareholders.\nThe team will provide more details with their prepared comments, but in summary, we will stay [ in ] the course, focus on the long term with the same vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to recent quarters, my comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and provide an update on our cost control efforts, while also balancing our investments to support future growth. I'll close with an update on our capital allocation plan for the remainder of 2024. As a general overview, while we have seen some moderation in inflationary cost pressures, the deflationary rate environment continues to pressure our margin performance.\nLet me start with a quick review of the second quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to the prior year period, revenue declined 7%, operating income declined 24% and diluted earnings per share decreased 27%. A combination of either lower volumes and/or yields, but most notably lower rates were the main drivers of the lower revenue, primarily in our Intermodal and Highway Services businesses, which includes our brokerage business and ICS and our drop trailer business in JBT. Our tax rate in the quarter was slightly elevated at 26.8%. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to fall in the range of 24% to 25%.\nWhile we have seen improvements across many of our cost categories, the lower revenue continued to put pressure on our margins across our business segments, with the exception of FMS and JBT, which improved operating margins year-over-year. We have been thoughtful and thorough in our approach to managing our costs. Last quarter, we quantified with our commitments to investing in our business through this downturn represented, which was an aggregate $100 million on an annual basis.\nWe continue to focus our cost efforts in areas that would not prohibit our ability to support our future growth or our future earnings power. These costs are primarily related to our investments in 2 of our company foundations, namely our people and our capacity. As to be expected, the majority of these costs are burdened in our JBI business and also, but to a lesser extent, our ICS and JBT segments. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to grow our business to scale into these investments.\nWrapping up with an update to our 2024 capital plan. We are updating our guidance for net capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. This compares to our previous expectation of $800 million to $1 billion. Keep in mind, this does include the previously announced purchase of Walmart's intermodal assets. This reduced plan largely reflects a moderation of both tractor and trailing fleet additions in addition to real estate projects.\nWhile our earnings performance has been under pressure, our leverage at the end of the quarter was 0.9x EBITDA, below our target of 1x. We also purchased just over $200 million of stock in the quarter. With our updated and reduced net capital expenditure plan, current market dynamics and our view of where we are in the cycle, we believe a disciplined approach to share repurchases is a prudent use of capital at this time.\nThis concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Spencer.\n\nSpencer Frazier\n\nExecutive Vice President of Sales & Marketing\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be joining the call. My remarks will focus on our sales and marketing strategy, but will also include some perspectives on the market as well as feedback we are hearing from our customers.\nDuring the second quarter, we saw more normalized seasonal patterns across our business. On the demand side, the second quarter felt more like what we're accustomed to seeing prior to the pandemic disruption. April started a little slower from a demand perspective, primarily due to the timing of Easter, but we did experience what used to be a typical end of month and [ in the quarter ] left in June. This was evidenced particularly in both JBI and JBT in the quarter, where we have seen strong improvements in bid compliance levels in the mid-80s to 90s levels, which we haven't seen in quite some time. We were able to meet the seasonal demand for our customers with high service levels across our businesses.\nOur customers have worked through most of their excess inventory and feel appropriately rightsized with current sales activity levels. While we cannot predict when the market will inflect, our customers know we stand ready to meet their growing transportation needs across our entire scroll of services.\nRegarding our scroll, our customers [ buy ] capacity across our suite of services and have come to expect a consistent high service level experience. In fact, greater than 90% of our top 100 customers buy more than one service from us and greater than 75% buy from 3 or more services. Among our segments, JBI and ICS have the highest overlap amongst our top 100 customers. We see the power of the scroll in our sales efforts as customers have recently wanted to deemphasize their use of brokers in favor of assets, and we've converted some nice wins over to JBT as a result. Being [ mode in ] different and offering customers the best solution will always guide our go-to-market strategy.\nAs we look at the overall freight market, we still see oversupply across all modes with shippers having options on both mode and provider to move their freight. Now while capacity is not a top concern right now, there is an awareness that this will change at some point, but the timing of which though remains unclear. Currently, cost and value are the primary differentiators right now for customers, and we continue to lean into the value we can deliver to customers with our premium service.\nAs we have said in previous quarters, we don't know when the cycle will shift and aren't going to make a prediction. But we remain committed to investing in our business for the long term and being ready to grow with our customers over many years to solve their transportation needs with high service levels they come to expect from J.B. Hunt.\nI'll wrap up with some of the feedback we're getting regarding peak season. We see the same data sets that most of you track and read the same headlines around what's happening in the ocean freight market. The feedback we hear is an expectation for a peak season this year, but the magnitude or length of peak remains to be seen. That said, some customers have pulled a portion of their peak freight forward a couple of months given the multiple macro factors that could impact the supply chain later this year. This pull forward has created an early peak on the water, but that hasn't translated into domestic inland moves just yet. We're working with customers on peak season plans to ensure we have resources properly positioned to meet their transportation needs.\nThat concludes my remarks. So I would now like to turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on dedicated, Final Mile business and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with dedicated. While we are not immune to the impact of the overall market, we believe our results during the quarter continued to highlight the strength and resiliency of our unique dedicated business model. We believe our differentiation is supported by our focus on providing professional outsourced private fleet solutions to a broad and diverse group of customers in addition to our relentless focus on delivering value to our customers.\nDuring the second quarter, we sold 325 trucks of new deals. While we have visibility to some losses or downsizing throughout 2024, our sales pipeline remains solid and our team has done well to backfill some of those losses. Despite the challenging market conditions, importantly, we have remained committed to our discipline in the types of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return thresholds. With a proven track record of high service levels and our ability to create value for our customers, we continue to have success onboarding new business and renewing business with our existing customers. We remain confident in our ability to execute on the transportation needs of our customers and the opportunity to further compound our growth over many years.\nGoing forward, despite our strong new truck sales in the first half of the year, I would expect our fleet count to end the year relatively flat from our Q2 levels with some additional startup expenses as new trucks are brought into the fleet.\nShifting to Final Mile. I continue to be pleased with our progress we have made to improve the overall health of this business. This journey started many years ago as we focused on a differentiated high-quality service to then focusing on revenue quality and remaining cost discipline throughout the process. The market for big and bulky delivery continues to evolve and customers are looking for a high-quality, safe and secure service provider with national scale.\nFor transparency purposes, our second quarter results did include a net benefit of $1.1 million from 2 offsetting claims settlements. Demand for big and bulky products remain mixed with stable demand for both appliances and exercise equipment but continued softness in furniture demand. We remain modestly encouraged by our sales pipeline and continue to see new brands engage in discussions with our team. We continue to strive to provide the highest level as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customer with a focus on being safe and secure. We will remain disciplined with potential new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service while we work to grow the business and improve profitability.\nGoing forward, we would expect some customer churn as we continue to focus on revenue quality [ but for ] margin performance to follow fairly normal seasonal patterns, excluding the unique items called out in the quarter.\nSimilar to the last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety. Our company was built on a foundation of safety for not only our people but also the [ mode ] [indiscernible], and we continue to invest in training and equipment to enhance our already strong safety culture. We continue to lead the industry with our fleet that is now over 97% rolled out with inward-facing cameras and we remain on track to be 100% complete by the end of the third quarter.\nAs you may recall, 2023 was our best safety performance on record for DOT preventable accidents per million miles, and I'm pleased to say with the help of our inward-facing cameras along with our numerous other innovative safety initiatives, we are seeing further improvement so far year-to-date. This is a testament to the quality of our drivers and the safety culture of our company as the cost of claims continues to move up exponentially, we remain focused on finding new innovative ways to further enhance our safety performance and mitigate risk where possible.\nThis concludes my remarks. I would like to now turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business during the quarter give an update on the market and service performance and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all of our stakeholders.\nI'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, while we saw seasonality that resembled more normalized pre-pandemic demand trends during the quarter, the impact of a depressed truckload market and competitive bid season in general, more than offset this and drove our volume down 1% year-over-year. This was primarily driven in the East where we compete more directly with one-way truckload, where our volumes were down 7% in the quarter. This was partially offset by our transcon business growing 4% in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand out of Southern California, where volumes were up double digits versus the prior year.\nBy month, our consolidated volumes were down 3% in April, up 1% in May and down 1% in June. During June, we did see a nice seasonal lift in volume, particularly towards the end of the month and importantly, we were able to meet our customers' capacity needs with strong service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network. As we look at the freight market, we continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over the road to intermodal as it is more economical and environmentally friendly. As I've said it before and I want to say it again, we stand ready and have the capacity and people in place to meet and exceed our customer service needs and recapture share from the highway moving forward.\nDuring the quarter, we did see margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially. This is largely related to the market pressure on our yields but also due to our capacity investments. While volume does mean more to us now than ever before, given our underutilized capacity, our modestly lower volume year-over-year and only slightly higher volume sequentially wasn't enough to absorb our higher cost and deflationary yield pressure. As discussed earlier in the year, bid season was competitive and largely wrapped up during the second quarter. We continue to see truckload pricing that we believe is [ not ] sustainable, particularly in the East and shippers took advantage, given the nature of our pricing cycle, we will be living with a large portion of the recently completed bids into the first half of 2025.\nWith regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers their commitment to the intermodal offering and growing the overall market. That said, we and our railroad partners know the true test of our collective service will come once freight volumes increase with higher overall demand on our networks. We remain confident in the collaborative work and investments being made to maintain high service levels as the inflection occurs.\nIn closing, we continue to strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us, and we continue to find new and innovative ways to better serve their transportation needs. Our service levels are exceptional, and we are confident that this level of service can continue as our customers' overall demand for our capacity increases. While we are not pleased with our current results, our optimism on the future growth of our business hasn't changed. We remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient cost competitive and more environmentally-friendly solution.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, while also providing an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360.\nStarting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive, with pressure on both volume and rate. Segment gross revenue declined 21% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by a 25% decline in volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in revenue per load. As you have heard, we did see some seasonality in the business with the relative tightness in the market around [ road check ] and in the later part of June. That said, our gross margins for the quarter were 14.8%, the highest we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2022, which is noteworthy given 61% of our volumes are under contract. We continue to focus on quality revenue and growing with the right customers as our yield performance indicates.\nAdmittedly, we are incurring some challenges integrating the previously announced acquisition of BNSF Logistics but remain encouraged and optimistic about the potential of the agent model on our platform. These challenges are masking some of the underlying progress we are seeing in our legacy ICS business. Going forward, we will remain focused on further rightsizing our cost structure, but ultimately, we need to push more volume through our platform in order to see material improvements in our results.\nMoving over to JBT or Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 12% year-over-year, driven by a 9% decrease in volume and a 4% decrease in revenue per load. This season was competitive, and we opted to remain disciplined on price, which resulted in some lost volume. That said, we are focused on attracting the right freight that best fits our network with the right customers that see the value of our service and network of trailing capacity.\nWhile we currently have excess trailing capacity in our network, we are working on ensuring discipline around our network to ensure that we have the right capacity in the right markets where our customers have needs and where they are growing. We hear from customers that they appreciate our high service levels and the flexibility that our drop trailer offering provides to their supply chains. Our model allows us to be more variable with our cost depending on the market, which we believe ultimately presents us with opportunities to scale this cost competitive service offering for customers while ensuring we generate an appropriate return on capital.\nGoing forward, our focus is on improving our trailer utilization rate while ensuring our capacity remains balanced across the network.\nI'll close with some comments on J.B. Hunt 360. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity and also drives efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. Technology is foundational to our company but it also created opportunities for strategic step groups to impact our operations. We continue to deploy enhancements to our system to increase the security of our platform, and have become much more stringent on carrier vetting to mitigate cargo [ step ] risk, which continues to be very prevalent in the industry and, in particular, for our customers who are feeling the impact. Long term, technology investments will continue to drive productivity and efficiency gains across the scroll and better position us for long-term growth with our customers.\nThat concludes my comments. So I'll turn it back to the operator who will open the call for questions."

Hunt Transport Services Inc. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in these forward-looking statements.\nFor more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I would like to introduce speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson, our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services. Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services and EVP of People. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some owing comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I will be brief with my comments, but I want to hit on a few topics before I turn it over to our team to give you their updates and to address your questions. Last quarter, we said goodbye and good riddance to 2023 and welcome the new year with some reservations and concerns but nonetheless confident in the strength of our organization and the journey we are on to build an even bigger and better company. Over the last several years, you have heard us talk about how we manage the business for the long term, remain focused on being financially disciplined and being for our people who have the knowledge and talent to help us execute for and on behalf of our customers.\nFrom that perspective, nothing has changed, and we remain committed to staying in the course. Over that same time, we have faced challenges, have taken some calculated risks and made some strategic decisions that I remain confident will positively impact our company and [ observe ] growth. To be fair and somewhat critical, the current environment we're in has remained persistently challenging and for longer than we had predicted. But what I remain confident in is the strategic decisions and the direction and course we are on is well charted. Our conservative nature, financial discipline and coming from a position of strength has afforded us the opportunity to invest throughout this period to better prepare us for the eventual turn, we stand ready.\nOur company and our teams are working hard. To use a sports analogy, we are putting in the work exercising the muscles, becoming more lean, challenging the playbooks we know and better preparing ourselves for our future state. While it's hard to see that in light of what I would characterize as a disappointing financial performance against our standards, I remain appropriately metered with optimism. Elements that support that view should and will be revealed in the following discussion from our leaders.\nFinally, as recently announced, this will be my last earnings call as Chief Executive Officer. It has been a tremendous honor to serve in this capacity for the last 13 years. Our Board of Directors has taken a very thoughtful approach to succession planning and has tremendous confidence in my successor and our entire leadership team. So now I'd like to turn the call over to our President and incoming Chief Executive, Ms. Shelley Simpson.\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. As John made pretty clear, the market continues to be challenging. We remain focused on what we can control and how we position our business to deliver exceptional value for our customers and shareholders over the long term. The challenge we face today as an organization is managing the business to best prepare us for future growth while balancing the need to manage and control costs in the near term. To be clear, the strategic opportunities we have across our business segments gives us great confidence in our future success.\nLast quarter, we introduced our priorities for 2024. Our focus as a management team and an organization is to execute on these priorities, which, as a reminder, are: one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence; two, scale our long-term investments in our company foundations, which are people, technology and capacity; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. Markets are always hard to predict. Even more so over the last several years, given the wild swings we have seen on both the supply and demand side of the equation.\nOne thing we know for sure, markets ultimately return to some balance after overcorrecting on one side or the other. We continue to view the market as out of balance and customers have been and are taking advantage. We've been surprised by the competitiveness in the bid season thus far. We can't predict when the current rate environment will change. And as a result, we remain committed to our efforts to control our costs. Importantly, though, we are doing this without sacrificing the long-term opportunities for our company to grow and generate greater returns for our shareholders.\nIn fact, I would argue, we've only enhanced it during the first quarter with some of the investments we've made. Most notably our purchase of the Walmart Intermodal container fleet. We are also adapting in how we approach our customers and contracts in terms of our commitments. We will always be long-term focused and strategic. That said, we will have to be thoughtful in how we work with our customers. Our management team and business leaders are intensely focused on our cost efforts while maintaining discipline on our long-term growth and return on capital thresholds. [indiscernible], I remain confident in our strategy and approach to manage through this part of the cycle.\nWe continue to make thoughtful and disciplined investments that will only enhance the future performance of our company. While the magnitude of this part of the cycle has certainly been more severe, both in terms of depth and duration, we strongly believe in our ability to outperform the market on service quality, value and growth. We have and will continue to prove our ability to deliver outperformance for our people, our customers and our shareholders. Our confidence is in our people, our experience our complementary businesses, our scale and our financial strength, which uniquely positions us for our future.\nAs we've said in the past, we remain committed to disciplined investments in our people, technology and capacity, but we will continue to challenge ourselves on our costs. I am confident that we will be better positioned as a result coming out of this part of the cycle as we continue to pursue our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter, provide some additional color on our costs and the impact on margins, as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2024. As a general overview, we continue to face inflationary cost pressures despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure. Our financial performance is not where we want it to be, particularly in Intermodal and our highway services. We recognize that some of this is driven by market dynamics while some is related to our decision to remain committed to our investments to drive future growth.\nAs Shelly alluded to, we remain committed to our efforts to control our costs while trying to maintain the right balance of resources to support our future growth. I'll start with a high level in the first quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 9%, [indiscernible] declined 30% and diluted earnings per share decreased 35%. The declines were primarily driven by a combination of lower yields and freight volume, combined with inflationary cost pressures. Our tax rate in the quarter was 28.7% versus 24.7% in the prior year. The increase was related to discrete items and other adjustments, and we continue to expect our annual effective rate to be between 24% and 25%.\nAs previously mentioned, in addition to the market dynamics, our commitment to our investments in our people, technology and capacity are putting additional pressure on our cost structure, and as a result, our margin performance. We have visibility to these costs and their impact on the performance of each business segment. On a consolidated basis, these costs aggregate to approximately $100 million related primarily to having too many resources with our people and capacity for our current business levels that we plan on scaling into over time.\nThat said, we remain committed to our cost initiatives and have identified additional areas of opportunity to address, which should not impede our ability to support meaningful growth of our business. We are confident in our ability to scale and leverage our investments. But right now, our focus is on how we best control our costs in the near term without diminishing the long-term earnings potential we have built in the business.\nSwitching gears to our capital plan. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide us with ample liquidity to deploy capital as needed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have navigated this challenging freight environment while remaining conservatively leveraged at or below our target of 1x debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. We did retire $250 million of our senior notes that matured in the quarter with availability under our credit facility. For net capital expenditures, we previously stated an expectation to spend between $800 million to $1 billion for 2024, and we have no change to that range despite some recent announcements to further expand our capacity in our Intermodal segment.\nAnd finally, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchases. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update of our area of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. During the first quarter, I'm pleased with the strength and resiliency of our results despite the challenging freight environment, demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well despite the feeling we are swimming against the current. We sold approximately 690 new trucks during the quarter, very strong start towards our annual gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 new trucks for the year.\nWhile our sales pipeline remains strong, as we said last quarter, we do have some visibility into fleet losses or downsizes throughout 2024. The strong start in sales gives us some confidence in backfilling these losses over the course of the year. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in terms of our fleet sizes across our accounts, although our customers continue to feel pressure in their businesses. While moderating, we continue to see some fleet downsizing due to business activity but also some bankruptcies here recently. We continue to remain disciplined on the types of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return targets.\nI'm pleased with the activity and recent sales we've been able to close in our pipeline. We remain focused on delivering value to our customers in this environment and maintaining the business, knowing it will support our future growth. Going forward, we remain [ confident ] in our differentiated model that has proven its resiliency in this tough market. and our ability to compound our growth over many years and further penetrate our large addressable market.\nMoving to Final Mile. We have made good progress improving our business from revenue quality, strong service metrics and more stabilized profitability levels, all while continuing to create value for and on behalf of our customers. We continue to see the market evolve and customers want high-quality service on a national scale to meet their big and bulky final mile delivery needs. Our first quarter results did include a benefit of $3.1 million from a favorable settlement of a prior year claim. Overall, demand for vegan bulky products remains mixed with soft demand in the furniture industry and stable demand in both appliances and exercise equipment.\nOverall, we are modestly encouraged by our sales pipeline and we continue to see new brands engage in discussions with our team. Our focus in this business continues to be providing the highest service level with a strong focus on being safe and secure as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customers. We will remain disciplined with new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service while staying focused on growing the business and improving profitability.\nSimilar to last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety, aligning with our company foundation of taking care of our people, but also the motoring public, we continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies to enhance our safety performance. We are over 85% complete with rolling out inward-facing cameras to our trucks with the goal of being 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. We have seen a meaningful reduction in on-road collisions per million mile and trucks that have cameras installed.\nAdditionally, we have reduced DOT preventable accidents per million miles, approximately 25% in the quarter as compared to the prior year period. As our focus on safety remains at the forefront of our operation as the cost of claims continue to move up exponentially, we continue our efforts to find new innovative ways to enhance our safety performance and further mitigate risk where possible. This concludes my remarks. So I would like to now turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all of our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, demand for our Intermodal Service was weaker than our expectations, while imports into the West Coast have improved and inventories per our customers are in a more balanced position.\nWe have yet to see that translate into any meaningful pickup in demand for our valued service product. Volumes in the quarter were flat year-over-year and by month, we're down 2% in January, up 3% in February and down 1% in March. While we are seeing growth in business in some lanes, particularly outbound Southern [indiscernible] we have been surprised by how much competition we are seeing in bids, but are remaining disciplined with our valued service offering. In February, we announced, we entered into a multiyear intermodal service agreement with Walmart and an arrangement that includes the purchase of Walmart's intermodal assets. This will increase our available container capacity as we execute toward our stated target of 150,000 containers.\nWhile this capacity is not needed at the moment, we saw this as a unique opportunity to make an investment that we feel confident will be beneficial to the organization over time. After not having enough capacity to meet our customers' demand in 2021 and '22, we have consistently been growing our capacity to ensure we are out in front to meet our customers' growth needs while also providing a high-quality service product that is reliable.\nWe are pleased with our rail provider service levels, their approach and commitment to growing Intermodal. We are in constant communication with the railroads on ways we can work together to drive growth. While we believe that weak truckload pricing due to overcapacity is influencing customer decision-making, we continue to see a large amount of freight that should be converted from over-the-road to intermodal and we have the capacity and people in place to grow with our customers and recapture share [indiscernible] we have said previously, we have the resources and capacity to handle significantly more volume than what we are currently handling to the tune of at least 20%. This has been a drag on our margin performance and more than anticipated given both the depth and duration of the current market dynamics. We continue to challenge ourselves on our costs while trying to balance the future needs of the business to support meaningful growth.\nIn closing, we continue to strongly believe in the strength of our intermodal franchise, our customers trust us, and we continue to find new and innovative ways to better serve their transportation needs. We are pleased with current results and have the people, technology and capacity in place that will allow us to scale into these investments. We remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient cost competitive and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments. I will also provide an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS and similar to the past few quarters, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive from both a volume and rate perspective. Segment gross revenue declined 26% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by a 22% decrease in volume and a 5% reduction in revenue per load. These figures include the contribution from BNSF Logistics, which contributed a little over $70 million of revenue to our results in the quarter.\nAs we expected, we've had some challenges with the integration of the business but are encouraged and remain optimistic about our opportunity to penetrate the small and medium-sized shippers through this channel. One additional challenge we faced in the quarter is the proliferation of strategic cargo theft that we have discussed previously, which I'll touch on later in my comments. We continue to make progress on adjusting our resources to our current business levels while driving greater accountability in the business. As everyone is aware, spot rates have and continue to be under a lot of pressure. While some of the weather-driven tightness in January, pressured gross margins, looser capacity in February and March helped recover to some degree.\nClosing out on ITS, we aren't pleased with the current results but we continue to make adjustments to improve profitability while focusing on ways to enhance productivity to allow us to scale disproportionately to our costs when the market turns. Moving over to truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 13% year-over-year, driven by a 9% decline in revenue per load and a 5% decrease in volumes. Overall, demand for our J.B. Hunt 360 Box offering is outperforming the overall market as volumes in the quarter were up once again versus the prior year. That said, we would characterize demand for drop trailing capacity and soft as a reflection of our current trailer utilization and what we are seeing in bids.\nSimilar to what you heard in intermodal, we have greater resources and trailing capacity than what the current demand environment requires. We view our trailing capacity specifically as being greater than 20% underutilized. We have been encouraged by how well demand has held up from Trailer Solutions, J.B. Hunt 360 Box but we have certainly seen pressure on rates. Thankfully, this model allows us to be more variable with our costs, and we think ultimately will present opportunities for us to scale a cost-competitive solution for our customers while generating an appropriate return on our capital.\nI'll close with some comments on 360. Technology enables our people to help drive productivity and also drive efficiency and how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. While technology is a foundational pillar for us, it has opened new [indiscernible] for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft given these organized groups access to thousands of loads through our platform. To combat the increase in strategic theft, we are making some adjustments to harden the security of our system, and have new initiatives that will deliver in the future to further enhance the security of our platform.\nAs you have and are likely to notice, we are shifting some processes to be more manual in nature until these new [ Seriti ] features are implemented. Long term, we continue to believe our technology investments will drive productivity and efficiency gains and remain confident that these investments better position us for long-term growth with our customers and allow us to create greater value for our stakeholders. That concludes my comments, so I'll now turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nLisa, in light at the time. Could we have the analysts ask one question and one question only."

My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the J.B. Hunt Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. Brad, you may begin your conference.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson, our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, our COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services and EVP of People. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I would like to hit on a couple of topics before I turn it over to our team to discuss our results and how we are seeing in managing the business. We remain long-term focused, and we'll continue to do so while being disciplined in our approach. I'm a believer in taking the bag with the good and the good with the bad, so let's start with the bad as well as the obvious. On the topic of insurance, we have been routinely covering with you the inflationary cost headwinds we faced as a company as well as an industry in the areas of professional driver and non-driver wages, health care benefits and equipment cost. However, as an industry, we are also seeing unprecedented pressure in the area of claims, cost or settlements. As you saw in our release, we incurred $53 million of additional costs in the quarter largely related to higher claims costs and exceeding cover limits in certain insurance layers. And this, despite 2023 being the company's best performance in history on safety, measured by having our lowest DOT preventable accidents per million miles. We remain one of the safest carriers in the industry, yet our insurance rates continue to increase as the industry experiences higher verdicts and as a result, higher litigation settlements.\nJury verdicts in trucking cases where the verdicts exceeds $1 million have seen an 867% increase in the average size of verdicts from 2010 to 2018. This is according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal reform. Given that the majority of motor carriers in the industry carry only $1 million in coverage just above the legal minimum of $750,000 in coverage. It's the larger carriers who bear the rod or disproportionate share of the escalating insurance and claims cost. And ultimately, these inflationary costs get passed on to customers and consumers. As you've heard from us repeatedly, we are continuously focused on our safety performance, and you've heard updates from Nick on our latest investments in this area. Our intense focus on safety and our investments in the latest safety technology and compliant equipment helps to protect our drivers, the motor and public, the environment, our customers and your investments. We remain steadfast and committed to the safety of our people and the motoring public, and we'll continue to invest in the latest technologies and training to support these efforts.\nOn the freight environment, we have turned the page on 2023. Goodbye and good riddance, as you are aware, 2023 presented many challenges, but I am very proud of our team and their perseverance and how they responded to these challenges. The experience of our leaders and the investments made during this downturn, I am confident will drive long-term value for the company. While the new year has begun and the calendar has flipped to another pace, not much has changed in regard to the freight environment. While we see opportunities across all of our business, it's good work is needed in the areas of revenue quality, controlling cost and execution to earn an appropriate return while delivering value to our customers. We remain committed to our focus on return on [indiscernible] and managing for the long term, but the freight environment remains in a challenged state. With all of that out of the way, I am truly encouraged by our team's collective efforts and the opportunities presented across all of our businesses and for our relative performance in this market through 2023. Intermodal is seeing some momentum on the volume side of the last few quarters in our work with BNSF and our other rail providers presents opportunities for growth in our future. Medicaid continues to be a steady performer in along with final mile, both had record years in segment operating income performance. And while ICS and JBT has faced the broad market challenges, we still see great opportunities to scale our investments in technology to drive efficiency in our customer supply chain in both our brokerage and power-only offerings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelly Simpson. Shelly?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. As we've navigated through 2023, we remain committed to our strategic areas of focus, including investing in our people, technology and capacity. Our people have and always will come first, and I am proud of the commitment to our people while continuing to invest in capacity for our network as we prepare to grow with our customers to meet their demands over the years ahead. The experience and talents of our people and our capacity to deliver are connected and enhanced biology investments, which combined together are what allow us to deliver exceptional value for our customers. As we have discussed the past couple of quarters, and as John discussed, we remain in a challenging environment, but we continue to see some signs of improvement, especially related to Intermodal volumes. Having said that, I think it's important to reiterate that volume is historically a leading indicator, while [ prime to ] typically a license indicator with uncertainty around the timing of any potential inflection. Going forward, our focus remains on how we deliver value for and grow with our customers over the long term by finding ways to improve efficiency and drive waste out of the supply chain. As we look to 2024 and the uncertain market dynamics, our focus as an organization has not changed. We continue to manage our business to put us in the best position for long-term growth. While we are long-term focused we are not satisfied with the current results in our business, especially the return performance across our business segments.\nIntermodal has seen positive volume growth, but the impact of pricing during the last bid season will be with us through at least the first half of this year. Dedicated margins were resilient in 2023, but the impact of truck count losses and lack of fleet growth will make top and bottom line growth more challenging this year. Final Mile is holding up well despite tepid demand in our end markets. Our brokerage and power-only businesses are under significant pressure on both volume and price and continue to fill the brunt of the freight market as evidenced by the performance. We are focused on controlling what we can control and remaining flexible to deliver the best value for our customers. This is where our go-to-market strategy and mode in different service offerings can help customers lower costs. We can save customer's money by converting over-the-road shipments to intermodal, which is cheaper and less carbon intensive. We can create the most efficient dedicated fleets or leverage our technology through our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source the most efficient capacity to drive value and differentiate the end experience for our customers, customer in our final one network.\nIn closing, I'd like to highlight our areas of strategic focus for 2024. First, we are focused on operational excellence to deliver exceptional value to our customers. While service levels are strong, we believe consistent and quality service will further differentiate us to peers and support our ability to win market share at acceptable returns. Second, we will continue to scale our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity. Business is something new for us, and our commitment to investment in these three areas further position us for long-term growth with our customers as the market recovers. And third, we want to remain focused on driving long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. We operate in a cyclical market with ups and downs, but over the long term, we believe our mode in different approach offers customers the most options to deliver the greatest value and solve for their needs, ultimately supporting our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and fiscal year, and will include more color on the insurance expense impact on the quarter as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2024. As a general overview, outside of intermodal and to a lesser extent, Final Mile, we didn't see many signs of the peak season in the quarter. Starting with our fourth quarter results. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 9%. Operating income declined 28% and diluted earnings per share decreased 23%. The declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes and ore yields combined with inflationary cost pressures. Fourth quarter results include a $53 million charge or $0.38 per diluted share related to higher insurance and claims expense primarily related to negative developments of claims and exceeding coverage limits in certain insurance layers. This charge is similar to a charge we incurred in the fourth quarter last year as certain claims from prior year incidents continue to settle at much higher amounts than we have historically experienced.\nFor the full year 2023, on a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue declined 13%, operating income declined 25% and diluted earnings per share decreased 24%. These full year results include the impact of the insurance charge I outlined previously. Looking to 2024, we expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in the areas of insurance premiums, capital and people costs. Part of the increase in insurance relates to increases in underlying premiums, largely due to market conditions, but also to provide greater coverage across the businesses. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide us with ample liquidity to deploy capital as needed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have navigated this challenging freight environment while remaining conservatively leveraged below our target of 1x debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA and maintain flexibility with our credit facility that has ample borrowing capacity if needed. Looking to 2024, we are planning for net capital expenditures between $800 million and $1 billion. Going a level deeper, our 2024 capital plan assumes $250 million to $300 million for new power equipment, primarily in intermodal and dedicated and $250 million to $300 million for new trailing equipment, which includes containers, chassis and trailers. We also expect to deploy $300 million to $350 million for real estate and other investments, including technology. In addition, our capital allocation plan in 2024 contemplates the continued support of our dividend, and we expect to take advantage of opportunities in the market to repurchase shares when they present themselves, all while maintaining our leverage ratio around [ Wim's ] EBITDA. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. During the fourth quarter, I am pleased with the strength and resiliency of our results despite the approximately $20 million of insurance-related expense incurred in the segment. Even with the challenging freight environment in 2023, our dedicated business had a record year in both revenue and operating income. Demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well, and we sold approximately 300 trucks of new deals during the fourth quarter, bringing our full year sales number to approximately 1,150 trucks. Our pipeline remains strong, but we do have some visibility into fleet losses and/or downsizes throughout '24 and are working hard to backfill these by executing on that pipeline. Importantly, we are remaining disciplined in pricing new opportunities to ensure we maintain our required rates of return. While 2023 was a challenging year, from a fleet growth perspective, I want to put some context around the work we have done to improve the overall strength and durability of our business. While we have experienced downsizing in a lot of our fleet, we even lost a handful of accounts over the last year, the percent of portfolio that churned in 2023 was about half of what we saw in 2009 during the Great Recession.\nFocus on private fleets and our customer value delivery process, CVD that was established from our experience during that time, put us up for better performance during this downturn. As we look to 2024, our strategic focus includes continuing to scale the business, create value for customers and to leverage our density to help offset inflationary cost pressures all while executing on behalf of our customers in the safest manner possible. Moving to Final Mile. We have made good progress on improving the revenue quality of our portfolio and our strong service metrics highlight the value we create for and on behalf of our customers. Our year-over-year change in profitability continues to outpace the change in revenue despite incurring $3 million and additional insurance related expense in the quarter. Demand for big and bulky products overall remains muted, particularly in furniture, but we did see a seasonal lift in demand for exercise equipment around the holidays. Our focus in this business remains on providing the highest quality service for the delivery of big and bulky items into the homes of our customers' customers.\nFocus resonates well in the market, and we are seeing new brands engaging in discussions with our team. As we move into 2024, we're focused on growing and scaling the business and building on the solid foundation that we have. We will also remain disciplined on revenue quality while focusing on operational excellence and execution for our customers and their customers in a safe, secure manner. Similar to last quarter, I will close with some comments on safety and our equipment, aligning with our company foundation of taking care of our people, but also the motoring public, we want to continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies to enhance our safety performance. We are over 60% complete with rolling out inward-facing cameras in our fleet with the goal of being 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. As a company, we had our best safety performance in our history in 2023, measured by having our lowest DOT preventable accidents per million miles. As you have heard, the cost of claims continues to move up exponentially. So we continue our efforts to find new innovative ways to enhance our safety performance and further mitigate risk where possible. Lastly, on equipment, we have cleaned out our older equipment and feel our fleet is refreshed and in good position heading into 2024. You heard John Tulo give you a range on CapEx, which reflects our better position on equipment age. This concludes my remarks I would like to now turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's preference. As you heard, we remain in a challenging freight environment but we have been seeing improving trends in Intermodal since the spring, which continued as evidenced by our 6% increase in volume for the quarter. In fact, we have seen an improvement in our year-over-year monthly volume trends since April or for 9 consecutive months. By month, in the fourth quarter, our volumes were up 6% in October, 6% in November and up 8% in December. During the quarter, we saw a peak season in Intermodal That neither we or our customers nor our rail providers were expecting, yet we were able to solve for our customers' capacity needs while maintaining high service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network.\nWhile we are encouraged by the volume trends we are seeing, it is worth reiterating that volume is historically a leading indicator, while price is typically a lagging indicator. We continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over the road to Intermodal, and we have the capacity and people in place to grow with our customers and recapture share from the highway. During the quarter, we saw margin pressure, both year-over-year and sequentially, largely related to the impact of bids priced in prior periods and also our results in the fourth quarter included approximately $16 million of higher insurance-related expense. We are currently in the early innings of bid season for 2024 and believe it is too early to comment on our expectations or the success of bid so far. Given our strong service levels and the unique value our Intermodal network can provide, we are working with customers to ensure this value is realized and that we earn an acceptable return on our investments to meet and serve their capacity needs.\nWith regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers their commitment to the Intermodal offering and growing the overall market. We remain encouraged by the work we are doing with BNSF in the West and the collaboration between our companies. We announced our new quantum offering during the quarter. We are very excited about this service and the potential to expand the Intermodal market by working with customers that have service-sensitive freight. During the quarter, we also announced our new intermodal service out of Mexico with GMXT through the Eagle Pass gateway connecting with BNSF. This gives our customers more options to solve their cross-border capacity needs, leveraging the networks of both GMXT and BNSF.\nIn closing, our focus for 2024 will be on regaining share from the over-the-road market scaling our business to better leverage our assets and investments and delivering excellent operational execution for and on behalf of our customers. We strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise, our customers trust us, and we continue to find new and improved ways to better serve their transportation needs. We have the people, technology and capacity in the network to handle significantly more volume than what we are handling today and remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient cost competitive and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and truckload segments as well as provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains very competitive, from both a volume and rate perspective. Segment gross revenue was down 25% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by a 12% decline in volume and a 15% decline in revenue per load. These figures include the contribution from the acquisition of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. The acquisition contributed a little over $90 million of revenue to our performance in the quarter. Similar to prior quarters, overall truckload demand, particularly in the spot market remains depressed versus the same period last year. While we aren't pleased with the current results in ICS, we are taking steps that will position us for better success in the future. We have focused our efforts on improving the revenue quality of our portfolio and calling some unprofitable freight, which contributed to the lower volume in the quarter. We believe we are out in front of the market with some of our work on rates, but it is too early in the bid season process to fully gauge our performance.\nWe are investing in areas to mitigate strategic test and enhanced capability in our platform while rightsizing resources with our current demand through attrition. Overall, we do believe these changes will position us for better long-term growth and success. Looking at 2024. In ICS, we are focused on quality volume growth that recognizes the value and quality service we provide in the market and rightsizing our cost structure further to align with activity levels either through scaling or attrition. We're also focused on premier execution across the business through reliable, excellent service, high on-time performance and further strategic theft mitigation. Moving over to JBT or Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 19% year-over-year, driven by a 13% decline in revenue per load and a 7% decrease in volumes. Overall, demand for our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering is outperforming the market as volumes in the quarter were up once again versus the prior year. The flexibility that we can provide customers by combining drop trailer capacity with the ability to source the carrier to move the load on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform is key and resonates well with our customers. Going into 2024, we are focused on improving the efficiency of our network through increased trailer turns, essentially creating additional capacity on our network without having to add a significant amount of assets. We are also focused on maintaining balance across the trailer network to ensure our assets are in the correct place to meet customer demand and continuing to grow while making sure the overall revenue quality of our portfolio remains healthy.\nI'll close with some comments on 360. Our investments in our company foundations, our people, technology and capacity remain a focus for us. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity and also drive efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. Despite the challenging freight environment and depressed demand, we continue to see improved productivity in our people driven by 360 platform. It is just masked to some degree by the current market conditions. That said, as our cost structure is becoming more aligned with current demand, we continue to believe our technology will drive productivity and efficiency gains as the market recovers, allowing us to meet higher customer demand levels without having to add as many resources while providing high levels of service for our customers. We know that investing in our people, technology and capacity is key to our success and remain confident that these investments better position us for long-term growth with our customers and allow us to create greater value for our stakeholders. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. Hey, Krista, let's open the call for just one question without follow-ups given the time."

My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Brad Delco, Senior Vice President for J.B. Hunt, please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I'd like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, EVP of People and President of Highway Services. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I would like to take a minute to highlight and reinforce some of the key tenets around how we manage the company. While the challenges in the freight cycle are well known and documented and as a result, there is no need to rehash here, I will again remind you about our long-term approach to the business. Our focus is on deploying capital in areas of the transportation industry where we see long-term opportunity to compound returns. We participate in an industry with a large addressable market that is cyclical.\nRemaining disciplined around our investments with a long-term focus on our people, technology that enables and capacity to deliver for and on behalf of our customers will support and drive long-term growth for the company and our shareholders. In March of 2022, we announced a joint initiative with BNSF to substantially improve Intermodal capacity and service for our customers. We've recently announced and closed the acquisition of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. These are key examples of how our companies are working together to best align efficient and value-added solutions for our customers.\nWhile the brokerage market is challenged, we see lots of opportunities to drive efficiency in the supply chain with our people powered and enabled by our technology, our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. We continue to work closely with BNSF and all of our rail service providers to strengthen and create a more reliable Intermodal product. And I'm pleased to see the progress in our Intermodal segment relative to the market and our results.\nDedicated and Final Mile continue to show resiliency in this environment, proving again that our premium service products can be differentiated from the competition. Our J.B. Hunt 360box product in our Truckload segment continues to experience growth, providing an asset-light solution while also leveraging our investments in technology to efficiently serve customers.\nIn closing, we have a tremendous team here at J.B. Hunt with a lot of experience. We will remain disciplined on costs and investments to best prepare the company to serve the growing needs of our customers. We will remain focused on earning appropriate returns on capital and driving efficiency in the supply chain to drive greater value for our customers. I remain confident in the future growth of the company. Now I'll turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson.\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. My comments will cover our areas of strategic focus and how we are setting ourselves up for long-term success. Of course, these comments will align with our priorities for 2023, which, as a reminder, are: first, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity; second, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and third, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders.\nAs you've heard us say since the fourth quarter call earlier this year, we have been in a challenging freight environment or a freight recession, largely driven by excess inventory in the supply chain. Our customers have been working through excess inventory. And as we stated last quarter, we felt like that destocking trend started to moderate in June. As we sit here today, we see further evidence of this trend and most notably in our Intermodal business, which is at the forefront of the North American supply chain. To be clear on the overall environment, we are not at a point yet to say we're out of the freight recession, but we do feel like we're coming out of it, or said differently, directionally, we are seeing signs of things moving in a positive direction.\nGoing forward, our focus remains on how we deliver value for and grow with our customers over the long term by finding ways to improve efficiency and drive waste out of the supply chain. As you've heard us say before, we have a long-term approach to how we manage our business and how we invest across our company foundations, which are our people, technology and capacity. Our people have always come first, and we remain committed to our investments in our people, in [indiscernible] in their safety and in fair and equitable compensation and benefits. Throughout our company, we have the experience and talent to execute in all types of environments.\nAs an example, the officers of our company have a collective 350 years of experience not just in the industry but at our company. The experience and talent of our people, combined with our capacity to deliver and connected and enhanced by our technology investments, are what combine to deliver exceptional value for our customers. I believe we're seeing evidence of the strength of our brand and service by staying committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity. As we progress in the recovery, I'm confident in our ability to meet the growing needs of our customers as a result.\nIn closing, while the environment is still challenging, it is important to keep in mind that pricing is a lagging indicator while volume is typically a leading indicator. We are encouraged by the performance of our Intermodal business that is gaining share in the market and the resiliency of our Dedicated business that continues to deliver efficient solutions for customers. Our Final Mile business is holding up well despite seeing varying degrees of demand from the end markets which they serve, highlighting the quality of our premium service product.\nAnd in our ICS and JBT business, we continue to see both segments feel the brunt of the freight cycle, most notably in price and volume, but continue to believe in our ability to scale this business to drive efficient solutions with our brokerage and drop trailer services. We will continue to manage the business for long-term growth, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll be brief with my comments but I want to hit on a few items, including a high-level review of the quarter and an update on our capital plan. So starting with third quarter results. Overall freight activity remained under pressure during the quarter as compared to last year. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 18% year-over-year, operating income declined 33%, and diluted earnings per share decreased 30%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes and yields, combined with inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the areas of salaries and wages, capital costs and insurance and claims expense.\nWe did have a discrete tax item in the quarter which lowered our effective tax rate to 18.2%. The overall impact to our earnings in the quarter was $0.16 per share spread across the tax and interest expense line items. We continue to make investments in our business for the long term across our company foundations, our people, technology, and capacity. From an invested capital standpoint, these investments are in real estate, equipment, both trailing and power, and as previously mentioned, we did close on the purchase of the brokerage assets from BNSF Logistics in the quarter.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity available to support our investments. We are conservatively leveraged at still below our target of 1x debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn and available as needed. I previously guided to $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of net capital spend for the year. Excluding the acquisition, we anticipate falling around $1.6 billion for the year. Similar to last quarter, some of this is timing-related, but also we are being prudent where it makes sense with our spend.\nIn terms of our capital priorities, no change on this front. First and foremost, we will continue to invest to grow our business. We will maintain an investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. And finally, we'll use excess cash to repurchase stock. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 267,000 shares and will remain active as opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and will give an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. I remain pleased with the performance of our Dedicated business in the quarter and the resiliency of our model. Demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well in the environment, and we continue to see many opportunities in our pipeline.\nIn the quarter, we sold approximately 265 trucks in new deals, which brings us to over 830 year-to-date. We are feeling more confident in hitting our gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks for the year, based on the timing of some deals that pushed from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some stabilization in terms of our fleet sizes across our accounts, although we have seen some slightly higher customer churn than we previously expected.\nIn the instances where we have lost an account, we believe the business was lost at inadequate rates of return, particularly considering the value proposition we bring to our clients. Going forward, we remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver value in the market that will allow us to compound our growth over many, many years and further penetrate our large addressable market.\nNow onto Final Mile. I am pleased with our performance in the quarter and how we have positioned ourselves as a premium service provider in the industry. I believe we have been able to prove our value propositions as we are nearing the end of some of our work to improve the revenue quality of our portfolio of business. This is evidenced by the year-over-year improvement in profitability in the segment despite lower revenue. In terms of the end markets we serve, we are seeing a slight uptick in demand across some of our end markets in this segment, although furniture deliveries remain in a tough spot. We continue to focus on providing a superior service experience delivering big and bulky items into the homes of our customers' customer. This continues to resonate well in the market, and as a result, we see new brands engaging in discussions and being added to our sales pipeline.\nSimilar to last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety and our equipment. We continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies that will improve and enhance our safety performance as an organization. This very much aligns with our company foundations, taking care of our people but also the motoring public. We continue to roll out inward-facing cameras in our fleet and remain on track to be 60% complete of our fleet by the end of the year. We are encouraged by the data we have seen so far since this initiative has gotten underway and also encouraged by the impact this should have on our cost to serve our customers. As the industry is well aware, the cost of claims continue to just move higher and higher, and we are feverishly working to mitigate the risk.\nFinally, a quick update on equipment. I previously stated that we would be complete with cleaning out older equipment by the end of the third quarter. We have had a couple of hundred units spill into the fourth quarter, but I would say we are in a very good position with our equipment across all businesses. I would say we are finally caught up with some of the backlogs that were created as a result of the pandemic and our rapid growth over the last few years. This concludes my remarks so I would like to now turn the call over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and long-term growth for all of our stakeholders.\nI'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. As I said last quarter and you heard Shelley say earlier, we believe the inventory destocking trend started to moderate in June, and we saw evidence of that trend continue throughout the quarter as our volumes inflected positive for the first time in 3 quarters. By month, our volumes were down 1% in July, up 1% in August and up 4% in September. In September, we had our largest Intermodal volume week in our history, and we're able to meet the strong demand with exceptional service.\nI'm encouraged by the fact that we are seeing the volume lift across both our transcontinental and Eastern network, highlighting overall increased customer demand for our Intermodal service. We believe this is driven by the overall market, but also we believe we are taking market share with our strong service that is outperforming the competition. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially, largely related to the full implementation of the recently repriced bids, which as a reminder, trended toward the lower end of our pricing expectations as bid season progressed. We continue to carry resources and capacity and the related costs to ensure that the quality of our service holds up as customer demand for our differentiated service product grows.\nWith regard to rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the Intermodal offering and growing the overall market. In fact, I'd say that our rail providers are dialed in, both in the East and the West. We believe that the railroads realized that the true test of their service will come once freight volumes increase with overall demand on their networks. But we and they are confident in their ability to maintain high service levels throughout the recovery. We are very encouraged by the current work we are doing with BNSF in the West and feel even more confident about our differentiated service. We now have J.B. Hunt employees in their headquarters in Fort Worth, working side-by-side together to create and customize solutions for our customers in solving to eliminate service challenges as they arise.\nWe continue to work collaboratively to solve for and on behalf of our customers, a clear differentiation in the market. We believe Intermodal presents a strong value proposition to customers with significantly improved rail service at a discount to truck pricing, all while cutting carbon emissions on a load by 60% compared to the truck alternative. As such, we see an enormous amount of freight that we believe should be converted from truck to intermodal. We continue to work closely with our rail providers and are encouraged to see the strong service which contributes to a better overall experience for customers.\nIn closing, we strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise and the opportunities to drive significant growth over many, many years. Our customers trust us, believe in our product and want more of it. We have the people, the technology to enable and the capacity to handle significantly more volume than what we are handling today and are excited to work with customers to meet their growing demand for efficient transportation solutions. That wraps up my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Before I begin, I would like to publicly welcome the new employees we recently onboarded as well as the agents from our acquisition of the brokerage operations of BNSF Logistics. We are excited about the opportunities this creates to leverage our investments in technology and the breadth of services we provide to better serve our customers.\nStarting with ICS. Overall, the brokerage environment remains challenged and competitive. Segment gross revenue was down 48% year-over-year, driven by a 38% decline in volume and a 17% decline in revenue per load. Overall truckload demand, particularly in the spot market, remains muted versus the prior year period. During the quarter, we did elect to focus our efforts on revenue quality and leading the market to push rates on certain lanes and accounts to appropriate levels. As a result, we did cull a decent amount of revenue and freight from our portfolio.\nAs the quarter progressed, though, we did see a sequential improvement in gross profit dollars per load, particularly in our spot business but also in our contractual business. We continue to invest in areas to mitigate strategic theft, enhance capability in our platform and rightsize resources with our current demand through attrition. Overall, we believe some of these changes will position us for better success in the future. Wrapping up on ICS and to level-set a little on expectations in the near term, we are seeing some margin pressure related to peak season so far in Q4, in addition to expecting some dilution from the recent acquisition in the fourth quarter.\nShifting now over to JBT or Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 17% year-over-year, driven by a 22% decline in revenue per load and partially offset by a 6% increase in volumes. Overall demand for our J.B. Hunt 360box service offering is outperforming the overall market as volumes in the quarter were up double digits versus the prior year. Customers continue to see value in the flexibility and efficiency of combining the drop trailer capacity with the ability to source the right carrier on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform to move the trailer. The right carrier on the right load and at the right price, that's the power of the platform. Going forward, we will continue to make investments in the development of our 360box offering to strengthen this product and drive greater efficiencies for our customers. Overall, we believe there is growing demand in the market for this service offering, and we see long-term opportunities in this area.\nWrapping up on 360. As you have heard throughout our comments, we remain committed to investments in our company foundations, our people, technology, and capacity. I think it's appropriate to point out that technology as a foundation between our people and capacity is the link that connects them. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity and creates efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. That capacity comes in the form of our own assets or the assets we can secure for or on behalf of our customers. J.B. Hunt 360 is our platform that empowers and enables our people and helps us access the right capacity to serve our customers efficiently with a valuable service.\nOur platform, J.B. Hunt 360 informs us about the market and provides a solid foundation to drive productivity in our operations across the organization and eliminate waste in the overall supply chain. While some of the productivity is masked by the current environment, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and our company with our investments.\nThis concludes my comments so I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad. [Operator Instructions] Krista, you can go ahead and start the Q&A."

Hunt Transport Inc. 2Q '23 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, EVP of People and President of Highway Services. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. Similar to last quarter, I'll touch on a few items and reemphasize some key aspects about how we approach and manage the business. As usual, we have key members of our leadership team here to discuss specific areas of each segment. We have noted for several quarters now the shifting dynamics in the industry, and we see in part the product of that shift in our results for the second quarter.\nThat said, we remain pleased with the collective and complementary nature of our business mix, some of which is revealed in our current results. For example, we see expected resiliency in certain areas of the business like DCS, areas with meaningful and unique growth opportunities to capitalize on in our Intermodal business. Areas with notable improvement in performance in Final Mile and areas of investment with a large addressable market and growing demand in our brokerage and power-only 360box offering in highway services. We maintain our perspective that all segments present meaningful growth opportunities looking for. As you've heard us stay consistently and for quite some time now, we remain committed to our investments and managing the business for the long term. The investments span across our company foundations, including our people, our technology and our capacity. We have a large addressable market and meaningful opportunity to provide unparalleled service and value to our customers across our complementary portfolio. We remain in pursuit of being better prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers while staying disciplined on our cost and relying on our vast experience in the business and together here at J.B. Hunt.\nIn closing, I remain confident in this leadership team. Our return on investment focused approach for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders and our ability to differentiate ourselves in the market. Now I'll turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. I wanted to provide an update on some areas of focus for our organization and how they align with the priorities for 2023 that I've previously shared which are to: one, remain committed to disciplined, long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity; two, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders.\nAs John mentioned, we remain committed to our investments around our company foundations, people, technology and capacity. As I've stated before, our people intentionally come first. We believe in creating and providing a work environment where our people feel welcomed, valued, respected, safe and heard. When we take care of our people, who are empowered and trained to take care of our customers, we create raising [indiscernible] for our services, which in turn supports our growth ambitions. We support this growth with investments in our technology and in our capacity, namely trucks and trailing equipment. Importantly, our investments in technology and capacity are highly focused on efficiency, productivity and safety. By remaining committed to our investments, we are prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers with our valued service offering. We have to be able to provide exceptional value to our customers at a competitive price that supports reinvestment in our business.\nAs stated on the last 2 earnings calls that we are in a freight recession. While the environment remains uncertain and demand for capacity is still muted, we remain very focused on how we grow with our customers, and we will continue to remain disciplined in our approach. We will do this by prudently managing our business in the near term, focusing on controllable costs. We will also continue to focus on our resource and people needs and make sure we are appropriately aligned and cost competitive to support our ability to serve and grow with our customers. We remain committed to putting the company in a better position to accelerate growth and market share gains for the eventual inflection in market dynamics. We will continue to manage and balance this approach as we progress.\nIn closing, by remaining committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity, which supports our ability to deliver exceptional value for our customers, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelly, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to touch on 3 topics with my remarks, including a high-level review of the quarter, an update on our capital plan and a quick comment on our balance sheet.\nStarting on second quarter results. Overall freight demand was muted versus the prior year and also below normal seasonal patterns as compared to the first quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined [ 18% ] year-over-year. Operating income declined 23% and diluted earnings per share decreased 25%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight and volumes and pricing trends and [ inflationary ] cost pressures, primarily in the areas of salaries and wages, capital costs and parts and maintenance-related expenses. We continue to manage and invest in the business with a long-term mindset, while also being prudent where we can on costs and expenditures. As it relates to our capital plan for the year, we expect net expenditures to fall within the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which brings down the high end of our range, which was previously $2 billion. Some of this is timing related, but also we are being prudent where it makes sense in the current environment.\nFinally, I wanted to briefly touch on the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $296 million of cash on the balance sheet. We elected to draw funds available to us under the new credit facility we put in place last September before the term portion of the commitments would expire. As a result, you will see a corresponding higher debt balance but our net debt level is about $40 million lower versus the prior quarter. This was done to maintain flexibility and maximize our liquidity. In terms of our other priorities, we have no immediate need for this liquidity other than reinvesting in our business, which is always our top priority for capital. Other priorities include supporting our dividend, maintaining investment-grade credit rating and opportunistically repurchasing shares. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 315,000 shares and will remain active as opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on Dedicated and Final Mile segments, and I want to also give you an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with dedicated. I am pleased with the performance of our dedicated business in the quarter and in particular, with the resiliency of our model. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions has moderated some, but remained strong as evidenced by our pipeline and our ability to sell new deals. In the quarter, we sold approximately [ 370 ] trucks worth of new deals and a nice acceleration from the 200 we sold in the first quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic on our ability to hit our gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks for the year. Circling back to the resiliency of our model. And as a reminder, our dedicated contracts typically average 5 years with annual price escalators linked to inflation-based indices with fixed and variable components to the payment terms among other features. Said differently, we do not have exposure to spot rates. We believe we are differentiated in the market by focusing on our proprietary customer value delivery, or CVD process to drive value for our customers, which ultimately supports our 98% customer retention rate.\nNow on to Final Mile. As we have discussed for several quarters now, demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment being delivered into the home is seeing some pressure. We see this not volume but also overall our pipeline and bid activity. That said, and as we've previously shared, we remain committed to providing a differentiated premium service product in the market while making sure we are appropriately compensated for it. We are seeing evidence of market share gains as customers value our service product backed by our brand. We have also discussed our focus on improving profitability, and I'm pleased to see and share some of the progress as evidenced this quarter.\nI'll close with some comments on safety and our equipment. As both Shelly and John alluded to earlier, we are focused on controlling our costs where we can. Our focus on safety for our employees and the [ motoring ] public also aligns with our focus on cost. Last quarter, we discussed another major milestone in our safety journey with the rollout of inward-facing cameras. We are pleased with the rollout thus far and what opportunities have been presented to coach and correct certain actions but also importantly, to reward and, in some cases, exonerate drivers from fault. We expect to have inward-facing [indiscernible] rolled out to 60% of our fleet by year-end.\nFinally, on equipment. We have made faster progress than expected on renewing our fleet following some of the disruptions OEMs experienced during the pandemic. Our average age of our equipment continues to improve, which will help on fuel efficiency, safety and reducing maintenance-related expenses. We expect to be fully caught up with our tractor replacement needs by the end of the third quarter. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I plan to review the performance of our Intermodal business and give an update on the market, our service performance and the opportunity we have to deliver value to our customers. I'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. Demand for intermodal capacity remained tempered, driven primarily by lower overall activity because of the inventory destocking cycle and the resulting declines in import activity. Volumes in the quarter declined 7% year-over-year and by month were down 9% in April down 8% in May and down 4% in June. While we are hesitant to suggest the presence of any green shoots, we saw evidence from customers in June that the destocking trend has moderated we experienced some pressure on margins in the quarter, largely related to the lack of volume and our inability to leverage our cost structure that is in the process of being built to handle significantly more volume. Volume growth is needed to drive down our unit cost as a broader portion of our portfolio was repriced this quarter. With regards to the market environment, but specifically to bid season wrapping up here in the near term, overall pricing for domestic Intermodal service fell within the range of our expectations as we entered the year but our overall portfolio trended towards the lower end of those expectations as the bid season progressed. As it stands today, Intermodal continues to present a strong value proposition to customers with vastly improved service at a discount versus the truck alternative at least in line with historical averages, [ all while ] cutting the carbon emissions on a load of freight on average by 60% versus the [ call truck ] alternative. We continue to see an enormous amount of freight to convert from highway to Intermodal and have been working very closely with our primary rail providers to build resiliency in our networks, capacity and a comprehensive service offering to capitalize on the opportunity. As it relates to the overall service from our rail providers, I'm encouraged by the trends we are seeing in velocity and on-time service quality but more importantly, the commitments to collectively work towards an even better overall experience and value proposition for customers. We have stressed the importance of sustaining service through a volume recovery, and that's where our joint focus is today. We like our position and feel confident in our rail providers ability to handle more volume as a recovery [indiscernible] we believe we are in a unique position with our rail providers to accelerate growth for the domestic Intermodal market by providing a differentiated service and value proposition for our customers.\nIn closing, I want to make sure I reiterate the opportunities we have to deliver significant value to our customers with the investments we are making in our people, technology and capacity. As I stated last quarter and what has probably become more evident this quarter, we have a network built and resources available to handle significantly more volume than we are executing today. We remain in a coiled spring status, better prepared to meet the future needs of our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks, while I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of integrated capacity solutions [ and ] our Truckload segments, what we collectively call highway services. I will also provide an update on [ J.B. Hunt 360. ] Starting with ICS, similar to some of the prior comments, overall demand in truckload brokerage was muted versus the prior year period and what would be expected from a seasonal perspective coming out of Q1. Top line revenue for the segment was down 43% driven by volume down 26% and revenue per load down 24%. Overall, our contractual business is holding up better versus our spot business on the volume front as our contractual business was up double digits year-over-year. This highlights the competitiveness in the market, particularly on the spot business, but also how much activity has declined in the spot market year-over-year. Notably, there seem to be some firming or at least a bottoming out on spot rates towards the end of the quarter, and we saw that reflected in our gross margin.\nWrapping up on ICS, we remain committed to our long-term investments in this area around our J.B. Hunt 360 technology, our capacity, which in this instance is third-party carriers and our people. We recognize we have too many resources for the level of activity currently in the system, and we'll continue to work to make adjustments to our model to set us up better to adapt to the swings in the market moving forward.\nNow moving to truckload. As you recall, we moved almost all of our company tractor assets or trucks out of this segment over to dedicated with our last quarterly report. Remaining is our drop trailer or 360box service offering served primarily by third-party carriers or independent contractors. These noncompany-owned asset providers source available drop trailer loads on our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, driving efficiency in the supply chain for our customers and for their own operations. We continue to be pleased and encouraged by the relative strength of our drop trailer demand as customers appreciate the value and flexibility it provides for their operations. Wrapping up on [ JBT, ] we are still relatively young in the development of our 360box service offering and continue to make investments to strengthen the product and drive greater efficiencies. We remain encouraged by the market's growing demand for our 360box service and we'll remain committed to our investments to drive long-term growth in this area.\nWrapping up quickly on 360, we remain focused on ways to maximize value for our customers and the carrier community. The level of engagement and interaction of the platform informs us about the market and provides a solid foundation to drive productivity in our operations across the organization and eliminate waste in the overall supply chain. While some of the productivity is masked by the current environment, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and our company with our investments. As is always the case, we will remain disciplined with our investments focused on driving long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. That concludes my comments, so I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call."

Thank you for attending today's J.B. Hunt's 1Q '23 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sierra, and I will be your moderator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance with J.B. Hunt. Please proceed.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements.\nThese statements are based on J.B.

For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, Mr. John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, EVP of People and President of Highway Services. At this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I'll touch on a few items but will be brief with my comments as we have members of our leadership team here to cover specific areas of our business. As we have discussed shifting dynamics in the market for several quarters now, it should be evident that freight demand is muted, even when taking into account seasonal factors. As I stated last quarter, I believe this environment presents both opportunities and challenges for our company that will ultimately put us in a better position in the future.\nI am seeing firsthand how this team, and might I add this experienced team, is responding to set our company up for long-term success and compounding growth as we navigate through these demand patterns. We remain thoughtful in our approach to managing the business and controlling costs where it makes sense without sacrificing our preparedness to capitalize on large, meaningful and addressable opportunities for the company. We have and will always manage this business with a focus on long-term growth built on our company foundations: people, technology and capacity.\nIn closing, I remain confident that the collective and complementary nature of our distinct business will again prove resilient in this environment. Coupled with experience, a strong balance sheet and a longer-term mindset, key elements which will continue to differentiate us in the market, we remain committed to investments and achieving our required return on those investments to support our long-term sustainable growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson, for more details. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & Human Resources\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. I thought it made sense to talk about where we are as an organization and what we are working on to set us up for long-term success. More importantly, how this aligns with our 2023 priorities that I've previously shared, which are 2: one, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity; two, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders.\nTo start, we're in a challenging freight environment where there is deflationary price pressure for an industry that continues to face inflationary cost pressures. Simply stated, we're in a freight recession. As we have discussed, we believe we are in a position to deliver exceptional value for our customers by leveraging our full suite of services to deliver maximum efficiency and eliminate waste in the supply chain. We can do this by providing cost savings opportunities by converting on-highway freight to intermodal, designing a highly engineered and efficient solution in our Dedicated segment, leveraging vast amounts of market competitive capacity sourced on J.B. Hunt 360 or by providing best-in-class service as one of the largest final-mile providers in North America.\nThe strength and resiliency of our organization is supported by our mode-neutral approach across all of our businesses and backed by our company foundations, which are our people, technology and capacity, and that's where we are today. So what are we working on? As we've committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity, we admittedly have too much cost in our system right now for the current level of activity in our organization. And while we want to prudently manage our business in the near term by focusing on controllable costs, more importantly, we remain focused on our long-term strategy: to compound our growth at acceptable returns.\nAs an organization, we have put greater emphasis in areas of our business by reallocating resources that will set us up to accelerate our growth and performance coming out of this current environment. One area in particular that has immense focus is in the area of safety. Also, as you might have noticed in our release, we moved pieces of our JBT and ICS segments into DCS and FMS segments, respectively, to best position the organization longer term. While none of our businesses are immune to this environment, I am confident that there are great things happening in our business that set us up for long-term success. Remaining committed to our disciplined investment while prudently managing our cost is an area of focus for us across our organization.\nIn closing, I want to say we remain cautious on the outlook for the year but remain confident in our ability to deliver value for our customers that will enable us to grow and take share through cycles while maintaining discipline on our returns on capital. As I have stated previously, we remain focused on the things we can control but remain committed to managing our business for the long term. As I look across our organization and see the experience and tenure of our team as a result of the investments made throughout our careers, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to touch on 3 topics with my prepared remarks, including a quick review of the quarter, some details on our capital plan for 2023 and bring to your attention some small changes we made in our segment reporting.\nFirst, on the quarter's results. As previously discussed, overall demand for freight capacity has moderated versus the prior year period as evidenced in our results. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year, operating income declined 17% and diluted earnings per share decreased 18%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes, moderating pricing trends and inflationary cost pressures, particularly in the areas of salaries and wages, insurance and claims and parts and maintenance-related expenses.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity available to support our investments to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Regarding those investments, our capital plan still contemplates between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of investment in 2023. To provide some greater detail, we expect about $400 million to $500 million for real estate, which will support our long-term growth plans for the company. The majority of the balance is almost evenly split between our tractor and trailing capacity needs. Keep in mind, trailing capacity includes both dry and temperature-controlled trailers and containers as well as chassis.\nThe growth in our Intermodal and Dedicated fleets the past 2 years, coupled with the lack of availability of new equipment as OEM supply chains were constrained, required us to hold our equipment longer. Accordingly, a large portion of our 2023 tractor capital is for replacement needs. We did repurchase some shares in the quarter and remain committed to be active in the market as opportunities arise.\nFinally, we moved the majority of our J.B. Hunt-owned tractors out of our JBT segment into DCS. These trucks have consistently operated in a Dedicated-like manner for customers over many years and makes more strategic sense to be managed out of our DCS segment while also allowing JBT to focus its efforts on scaling our J.B. Hunt 360box service offering.\nSecond, we moved our non-asset LTL business out of ICS and into Final Mile, which has similar operating characteristics as our Final Mile business. These realignments best position our organization for our future and focuses each segment's people and assets in particular areas of expertise. We have included an addendum in our earnings release to provide a historical perspective for these moves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide some comments on our Dedicated Contract Services and Final Mile segments and also give an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. While demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remain strong, we have seen some moderation in our pipeline of opportunities. That said, we sold approximately 200 trucks of new business in the first quarter and remain optimistic about hitting our target for the year.\nOur net truck adds in the quarter increased 426 but included trucks transferred from JBT. Excluding this, our net truck count increased 28 units in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, this number was influenced by the cleaning up of extra trucks held due to the age of our fleet and also partly driven by our CVD or customer value delivery process. This process optimizes fleets to manage costs for our customers as demand levels in their business change. This supports our 98% retention and our future growth opportunities. To a lesser extent, we did see some account closures in the quarter. Overall, we continue to carry momentum from our success over the last year, which drove revenue and operating income growth of 13% and 29%, respectively, in the quarter.\nNow on to Final Mile. As we discussed last quarter, demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment is soft, but this hasn't deterred us from our commitment to improving profitability in this segment. Our efforts are focused on ensuring we are getting appropriately compensated for our high-quality differentiated service product in the market. We continue to put business at risk during this renewal process, and at this point, we remain pleased with our ability to retain business. This is, in my opinion, a testament to our service. Encouragingly, we are seeing some activity in the pipeline but overall demand remains tempered in this segment.\nI'll close with some comments on safety. We continue to make significant investments in our training and new technologies to improve safety performance in our operations. As a result, we've recently announced the rollout of inward-facing cameras across our fleet to help address the distracted driving and other coachable activities with our driving workforce.\nThis is a big step for our organization, follow similar bold moves in our history to lead in the area of safety, including: in 1996, increasing our pay package to attract experienced drivers, which resulted in a 50% reduction in DOT-preventable accidents; in 2006, supplementing the DOT urine drug tests with hair testing, which resulted in an 87% decrease in DOT post-accident positive rates; then in 2011, rolling out forward collision warning systems, which delivered nearly a 50% reduction in rear-end accident frequency; in 2016, rolling out forward-facing cameras, which drove an 18% reduction in collision frequency per million miles. I am proud of our company's commitment to the safety of our employees and the motoring public. That concludes my remarks so I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nEVP of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter and reiterate the opportunities we have to deliver significant value to our customers with the investments we are making in our people, technology and capacity.\nI'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity was tempered, driven by overall freight activity but specifically lower imports and elevated inventory levels across the supply chain. Volumes in the quarter declined 5% year-over-year, and by month were down 2% in January, down 4% in February and down 8% in March. As we stated in our earnings release transcontinental volumes were down 9% in the quarter but our Eastern volumes were up 1%.\nI think this is an important call out as we have been growing volumes in the East, which is the most truck competitive market while being in a depressed truckload environment. This mix shift to shorter length of haul freight does influence contribution dollars per load, which did impact us in the quarter but also should signal our ability to deliver value to our customers in this market.\nRail service predictability and consistency has improved to near pre-pandemic levels, while customer detention of equipment improved even further and as the quarter progressed. While we have seen a decline in revenue associated with the detention of equipment, we have not yet offset that impact with the onboarding of new volume. As I've stated recently, our network and service offering is a coiled spring that can handle significantly greater volume today and unlock a lot of value for our customers and our company. We have the people, the dray capacity and the containers that could handle upwards of 15% to 20% more volume today.\nAs we have shared recently, we have been meeting with customers and continue to be encouraged by the feedback we are receiving about our service. Customers trust us and our [say do] culture. They believe in our Intermodal product and they want more of it, but part of that is influenced by the economy and overall freight demand. We feel very confident that we have a differentiated product in the market that will support our ability to take share. We are encouraged by the results we are getting so far in the bid process and look forward to the opportunity to prove the value we can deliver to our customers.\nIn closing, we strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise and its opportunities to drive significant growth over many years. It provides significant value for our customers with opportunities to save money by converting freight from the highway to Intermodal, which reduces cost and is further supported by fuel costs and carbon emissions savings. We are in the best position to commit more Intermodal capacity to our customers as we progress further through the current bid season, which should present meaningful opportunities to unlock value in our network for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. That concludes my prepared remarks so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nEVP of Dedicated Contract Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. But before we begin, as mentioned in our release, we carved out our LTL operations from ICS, which are now included in Final Mile. We also carved out most of the operations of our company-owned trucks from JBT, which are now included in DCS results.\nI will speak to our results on a reported basis with the adjustments to our prior periods. Regarding this shift, we believe that better aligns the management of these particular businesses and allows Highway to focus our efforts on leveraging our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source third-party capacity for the movement of full truckload freight.\nNow turning to the business, I'll start off with ICS. Top line revenue was down 42%, driven largely by a 25% decline in volume. The truckload market continues to see significant pressure on both volume and price and we are certainly seeing that, particularly in the spot market as our contractual truckload volumes were up in the quarter. Touching on our volume performance, we are not immune to the market but we are also not meeting our expectations.\nThat said, I want to remind you of the work ICS, powered by J.B. Hunt 360, handled a year ago to help meet the needs of our Intermodal and Dedicated customers as congestion and equipment delays tempered our ability to serve their needs. ICS was able to step in and cover freight, which is a testament to the power of our scroll and our mode-neutral approach. However, as we stand here today, we are clearly facing tougher comps as a result of that dynamic.\nNow moving to Truckload. Similar to my message last quarter, we continue to see demand for drop trailing capacity holding up better than the market, although we are not fully immune from these market dynamics. Our 360box volumes were up double digits in the quarter as customers continue to like the flexibility of blending their live and dropped trailer capacity needs by utilizing the J.B. Hunt 360 platform.\nAs it pertains to both segments, our goal remains to leverage our J.B. Hunt 360 platform and make investments that will allow us to scale our business by outpacing the market. While the market is challenging, we are focused on controlling our costs. That said, we do remain committed to our long-term investments in our people and technology to deliver exceptional value for all of our stakeholders.\nWrapping up quickly on 360, we have built the foundation of our platform and what we need to commercialize to our customers and carriers. Our task now is to scale and optimize these investments. As you might have noticed, we did backed up on some of the stats on 360, both on a dollar and a percentage basis. A significant portion of that is market-driven but some of that was intentional in the quarter. We did have to insert some manual processes and restrict some third-party capacity on the platform to manage risks around several large cargo theft rings. This did impact profitability in both segments in the quarter.\nThat concludes my comments so I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to give some instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. And Sierra, in the interest of time and based on the number of callers we have in queue, we're going to do 1 question with no follow-ups. Sierra, you may open the queue for questions."

Hunt's Fourth Quarter '22 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Elliot, and I will be coordinating your call today. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. The floor is yours. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I'd like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, our COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, Executive Vice President of People and President of Highway Services.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nCEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning. My comments will be brief today, as we have members of our leadership team here to cover specific areas of our business with more detail.\nAs we reflect on the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022, we have seen and experienced a cyclical shift in market dynamics that will present both challenges and opportunities as we navigate through the upcoming year. That said, we remain encouraged by trends from our rail providers that present opportunities for faster transit times and in turn, greater service quality and value for our customers.\nWe also see some loosening in the labor market and some modest improvements in equipment availability. Conversely, demand for transportation service in the fourth quarter was seasonally weak as customers manage through levels of elevated inventories.\nAs we've discussed in the past, we have confidence in the collective and complementary nature of our distinct businesses that are built to be resilient and durable through market cycles. I have a tremendous amount of confidence in our people, led by the 14 officers of our company that have a combined 340 years of experience here at J.B. Hunt.\nIn closing, our team will remain disciplined and focused on charting our course to compound returns on the capital we've deployed to support our long-term growth for the benefit of our stakeholders.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & HR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning. My comments today will mirror many of the things I shared last quarter, and we'll focus on our priorities for 2023 and beyond.\nIf you recall, we discussed 3 priorities as an organization. First, to remain committed through disciplined, long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity. Second, to deliver exceptional value to our customers across our entire organization. And third, to deliver long-term compounding returns for our shareholders.\nAs we have discussed the last 2 quarters, and as John mentioned, we've seen a shift in our market dynamics, but our focus as an organization has not changed. We continue to manage our business to put us in the best position for long-term growth. We believe, first and foremost, that it starts with our people, who are responsible for delivering exceptional value and service to our customers, who in turn trust us to meet their growing transportation needs.\nWe believe our suite of services across the J.B. Hunt scroll provides customers exceptional value from a company they have learned to trust over the many years and cycles. Our challenge for 2023 is to deliver exceptional value for and on behalf of customers in this market.\nIn the past, we talked about what customers value from their trusted transportation providers, which is cost, service and capacity. During the pandemic, customers value capacity most, with less weight on cost and service. We see the shift occurring now where customers are putting more value on cost or how to save the money and on service quality as capacity is less difficult to source.\nWe believe our suite of services can and will present our customers opportunities to save money with our industry-leading Intermodal franchise, highly engineered dedicated capacity, a scaled asset-light highway services offering, and one of the largest Final Mile Services in North America.\nIn closing, I want to say that we're approaching 2023 with some caution around recent demand trends, but remain highly confident in our ability to thrive in any environment. We will focus on controlling what we can control, managing our business with a focus on long-term growth while remaining nimble. We will compete in the market to earn, reinforce and gain our customers' trust and their freight.\nWe are excited about the many ways and opportunities we have to deliver value to our customers, which we believe will reveal itself over the course of 2023 and well into our future.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & CAO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will cover our recent performance in the quarter and for the fiscal year 2022. I will also provide you a preliminary view on our capital plan for 2023.\nOverall, results for the quarter were mixed, as freight volumes were pressured by unseasonably soft demand as compared to prior quarters of the year. That said, operating results were fairly resilient in spite of an unusual item that I'll touch on later. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the quarter [grew] 4% year-over-year, but operating income declined 13% and GAAP earnings per share declined 16%.\nWe incurred a rather large income statement item in the quarter for approximately $64 million or $0.46 per diluted share for an incremental pretax increase in casualty claim expense. This charge is similar to a charge we incurred in the second quarter of this year, as certain claims from prior year incidents continue to settle at much larger amounts than what we have historically experienced.\nFor the full fiscal year 2022 on a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue grew 22%, operating income grew 27% and earnings per share grew 29% versus 2021. Based on the solid performance for the year, we voluntarily paid out an $8.8 million appreciation bonus in the fourth quarter to our frontline employees in recognition of their contribution to a fantastic and record year for our company.\nOf note, we paid a similar appreciation bonus a year ago. So the year-over-year impact was not significant, but worth calling out when looking at sequential performance.\nWe continue to focus on and maintain a strong balance sheet, providing us with ample liquidity to deploy capital to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital plan for 2023 contemplates between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of capital for business needs. This includes elevated levels of replacement demand as a result of equipment challenges experienced over the last 2 years, growth CapEx to support investments primarily in JBI and DCS and investments in real estate.\nImportantly to note, a large portion of our growth CapEx is success-driven based on our ability to secure long-term dedicated contracts. This growth component and the timing uncertainty is the reason for this range.\nOur capital allocation plan for 2023 also contemplates supporting our dividend consistent with our long-term practice as well as taking advantage of opportunities in the market to repurchase shares. We will continue to monitor and manage our leverage target to around 1x EBITDA, but are comfortable going above this level if investment opportunities present themselves.\nThis concludes my remarks, and I will now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning. I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and update you on other areas of focus across our operations.\nI'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remained strong as we sold approximately 330 trucks in the fourth quarter, which was greater than the trucks sold in the third quarter. This brought our full year truck sales number to just over 2,000 trucks, which compares to our stated target range of 1,000 to 1,200 per year. Our backlog also remains strong with more opportunities in the pipeline today versus the same time a year ago, but we have seen some moderation in the breadth of the backlog.\nOur net truck adds in the quarter declined 187 units as compared to the third quarter, largely as a result of us making progress on our equipment trades as new equipment availability improved, but also because some of our downsizing of fleets to match our customers' business levels.\nAs we've discussed before through our CVD process, our customer value delivery, we optimize and reoptimize our fleets to present value savings opportunities for our customers. This ultimately supports our 98% retention rate of our customers as well as supports future growth opportunities with these same customers.\nGoing forward, we will remain confident in our ability to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of this business as we deliver superior value for our customers with our highly engineered outsourced solution.\nShifting to Final Mile. We remain focused on improving profitability in this business by working through contracts and making sure we are fairly compensated for the value we deliver. Achieving the appropriate level of profitability will support further investment needed to meet the growing needs of our customers in this secularly growing segment of the market.\nWe will continue to be disciplined on our commitments and remain willing to put business at risk to achieve the appropriate levels of profitability, which could ultimately influence our top line performance in the segment. Demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment has moderated some, as the headlines might suggest. But we have seen strength in our fulfillment business with off-price retailers seeing lots of opportunities with discounted inventory in the channel.\nClosing with some general comments on operations. Similar to my update last quarter, we continue to see improvements in areas around professional driver recruitment and retention, but at elevated cost. We are a touch more optimistic about equipment availability in '23, largely as a result of bringing in a third OEM into our mix, but maintenance cost remains elevated across the company.\nWe remain focused on our safety performance, but are doubling down on strategic initiatives across the company to improve performance in this area given the elevated cost the industry is experiencing.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nExecutive VP & President of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter and talk about our opportunity to deliver exceptional value and capacity to our customers in 2023 and beyond.\nI'll start by reviewing the performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity was seasonally weaker than normal, as peak season activity leading up to the holidays was absent this year. Volumes for the quarter declined 1% year-over-year and by month were up 4% in October, down 3% in November and down 5% in December.\nWe experienced improvements in rail velocity in the quarter and also saw some modest improvements in customer retention of equipment on a sequential basis. That said, we still believe we can see further progress on both fronts which will further improve velocity and decrease transit times in our system.\nWe believe that current trends around velocity present opportunities for us to sell a higher valued and reliable service product in the market. As we think about 2023, we see a lot of opportunities to deliver value to our customers with our industry-leading Intermodal service product.\nAs Shelley discussed, customers have shifted their focus more on cost and service versus capacity. We believe our Intermodal service product presents our customers with opportunities to save money by converting highway freight back to Intermodal, which reduces their cost and is further supported by fuel cost and carbon emission savings.\nWhile import volumes have been weak, we still see opportunities to gain customers' wallet share by converting highway freight and transloading more international freight into our domestic containers. Additionally, we are in the best position to commit more Intermodal capacity to our customers as we progress through the current bid season based on solid improvement in rail service levels and our investment to expand our capacity.\nFinally, because I anticipate this being a question, I thought I'd address it here. As you are aware, we have more capacity and better alignment with our Western rail provider, BNSF, and we have both committed to the long-term growth of our collective Intermodal service offering.\nWe will compete in the market on the basis of cost, capacity and service, and we feel confident in our ability to earn our customers' business and grow our wallet share. We are not approaching 2023 with a volume versus price mentality, but how do we set up our business to drive the greatest shareholder value over the long term. This was my eloquent way of saying we historically have not given any guidance on price, volume or margins, and we will continue that streak, but also the streak of managing our business to compounding our growth and returns over the long term.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nExecutive VP & President of Highway Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I'll also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360 and how we continue to see the platform bringing together our scroll, but specifically Highway Solutions to drive value for, and on behalf of our customers, whether with, or without a drop trailer solution.\nI'll start off with ICS. ICS top line revenue was down 33%, comprised of a 27% decline in volume and a 9% decline in revenue per load. Our truckload volume in the quarter was down 21%. Transactional or spot truckload volume was down year-over-year, but contractual volume was up slightly year-over-year.\nWe experienced additional pressure on our transactional and contractual business in the fourth quarter as demand and volume were unusually soft during what is normally considered peak season. Maybe said differently, there was no peak, and demand was actually weaker in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, which is atypical.\nAs we've discussed in the past, our goal remains to leverage our platform and make investments that will allow us to scale our business by outpacing the market. Despite the poor performance on our top line, which did influence our profitability, we do remain in our people and our platform, J.B. Hunt 360 to deliver exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders over the long term.\nShifting to truckload. While the freight environment was challenging in the quarter, we continue to see evidence of demand for drop trailing capacity holding up better relative to the overall market, which we believe was demonstrated in the quarter. Volume in JBT increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. We believe customers continue to see value in the blending of their live and drop trailer capacity needs that we can provide by leveraging our platform powered by J.B. Hunt 360.\nAs we move into 2023, we will remain focused on leveraging our investments in our people, technology and capacity to further scale the business. We see a long runway of opportunity for future growth in 360box, supported by disciplined investments, solid execution and earning an appropriate return on our capital.\nWrapping up on J.B. Hunt 360, I wanted to take the last minute here to make sure the investment community understands that our digital freight marketplace is a tool that drives value across our entire enterprise. For example, it allows us to source third-party Intermodal dray capacity.\nIt provides us backhaul freight opportunities in DCS and allows us to prop up a start-up fleet as we hire drivers or source equipment. I believe more obvious, you see the results in ICS and JBT as we are able to run non-asset or an asset-light business, leveraging our data and systems to provide almost unlimited capacity for and on behalf of our customers.\nICS and JBT collectively is our highway solution for our customers, representing the largest segment of the North American transportation market. Whether the customer needs drop trailers that historically could only be provided by large asset truckload carriers or a spot load in a live load, live unload network, we are one solution on one system backed by the J.B. Hunt brand.\nThat concludes my comments, so I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to give instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. And operator, in the interest of the number of people we have in queue, can we do just 1 question per caller? Thanks. Thanks, Elliot."

Thank you for attending today's J.B. Hunt 3Q 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tia, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may proceed.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson, our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, EVP of People and President of Highway Services. At this time, I would like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments.\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nCEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. As we reflect on the performance of the overall business in the third quarter, we echo many of the same themes discussed on our last call with an intense focus on changes in the freight markets we serve. The results in many areas of our business achieved appropriate targets in light of the cyclical shift in market balance I've referenced last quarter. While some improvement has been seen in rail service and company hiring challenges, in particular with our driver force, we continue to face difficulties in equipment availability for growth and replacement, along with the uncertainty of the direction of macro conditions.\nClearly, there are also areas of our business with opportunity for correction. That said, let me be clear, the businesses we've built, the changes we've implemented and the team's collective experience have and will continue to reveal themselves as value-enhancing catalysts for our customers, our company and our shareholders.\nLet me address some of the points around the market dynamics referenced. Further evidence has presented itself over the course of the quarter that requires an increased level of caution and awareness on broader demand trends and economic activity. Data, experience and frequent dialogue with our customers will continue to guide us in this area. The complementary nature and diversification of our businesses will continue to serve us well in this changing market.\nAs mentioned earlier, rail service has shown real signs of improvement in both velocity and reliability during the quarter with positive momentum building, the most notable increase coming from our friends at the BNSF. We are encouraged by the trends and Darren will expand on this area in his remarks. I remain in active and regular dialogue with the senior leaders of our primary rail channels on opportunities and investments required to fully restore service levels needed to capture the opportunities presented with Intermodal.\nWe are optimistic about the path forward with Intermodal and with all aspects of our collective services. Members of our leadership team are here and will cover areas of our business more specifically for you. But at this point, I would like to turn the call over for the first time to our new President, Ms. Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nPresident, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & HR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. First off, I'd like to start by saying how humbled and excited I am to be stepping into this new role at J.B. Hunt. Over the years, you've heard me talk about various areas of the business that I've had the honor to lead. I approach this new position with the same passion for our people, all nearly 38,000 employees at J.B. Hunt, and for delivering exceptional service and value to our customers.\nAs John spoke about some of the current indicators that are present in our industry, I want to remind everyone of our say/do culture. And with that, let me share with you what our go-does or priorities are right now for us as an organization. Over my 28 years at the company, I've been fortunate to have worked with some great leaders. As I sit here today, I'm reminded of a saying our Chairman would say and that is, \"Don't starve your opportunities.\"\nAs an organization, we recognize unique and significant opportunities in the marketplace that have been and are being presented to us. As a result, we will remain committed to disciplined investments in our company foundations, which I spoke to last quarter. That is our people you trust, technology that empowers and capacity to deliver. When we make the right investments in the right people, give them the proper tools to equip and empower them to deliver value and exceptional service to our customers, all of our stakeholders should reap the benefit. So priority one, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in and for our future growth, and that starts first and foremost with our people.\nOver the last 2 months or so, I've traveled and met with our people in the field and across the organization, and I asked each of them the same question, how can you, in your role, drive more value for our customers? I'm encouraged by the feedback I received, the energy of our people and the rallying around just that simple question. As an organization, we need to deliver the greatest value to our customers by providing unmatched service at a fair and equitable return. So much across our organization goes into that equation from being cost competitive, being quick to adapt, making the customer experience exceptional and making sure we are in a position to say yes to our customers' growing needs. So priority number two, deliver exceptional value for our customers across the entire organization.\nFinally, I believe in something John has always shared with us, and that is, growth is oxygen. It provides opportunities for our people in the organization to also grow, develop and build meaningful and lasting careers. We have a deep and tenured bench of talent across our organization who are leading and developing our future leaders. Having a disciplined approach to our capital allocation process supports and funds the investments we make in our people, technology and capacity to better serve our customers. This recipe should continue to support our future growth and value we create for our shareholders.\nSo I'll leave you with one last priority, to deliver strong value for our shareholders. As John alluded to in his comments, we see further evidence of a shift in marketplace dynamics that will require us to remain fluid in our approach to managing our business. We often reference that word throughout the pandemic as challenges and uncertainties were present, which feels appropriate at this time as well. Our business leaders will cover our plans with you in more detail. And that concludes my comments, so I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow.\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & CAO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will be brief and will cover our recent performance in the quarter on a consolidated basis. I'll also provide a quick update on our CapEx plans. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the quarter on a consolidated basis. As John remarked, we hit targets in areas of our business and fell short in others, but that highlights the benefits of our diversified and complementary model.\nOn a consolidated basis, revenue grew 22% year-over-year, operating income grew 32% and GAAP earnings per share grew 37%. From a cost perspective, we continue to experience inflationary pressures across most areas of our business but primarily around labor, equipment, including both parts and labor and in the area of claims. We are keeping a close eye on receivables, credit and bad debt as economic conditions change, and we'll continue to monitor the environment and manage accordingly.\nWe purchased just shy of 350,000 shares in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date spend on repurchases to approximately $300 million. We will continue to explore share repurchases going forward as opportunities are presented, and we remain committed to buybacks as a capital management tool with support from our Board.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with net leverage moderately below our target of 1x trailing 12 months EBITDA. During the quarter, we paid off $350 million of senior notes and entered into a new $1.5 billion credit facility, increasing our flexibility and overall liquidity for future needs. On net CapEx, we spent just over $1 billion year-to-date and expect to fall short about $1.5 billion plan for the year.\nOur capital expenditures in the future will largely be dependent upon business needs, but levels may remain elevated as our replacement needs are high, given equipment delivery delays and supply chain constraints experienced over the last 2 years. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John. Good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and update you on other areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private-fleet solutions remained strong as we added more than 450 trucks to the fleet during the quarter. While our backlog remains strong, we have some moderation to more normalized levels after 2 years of significantly above-normal trends.\nWe sold approximately 280 trucks worth of new business during the course of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total just shy of 1,700 trucks. As a reminder, this is well above our long-term guidance of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks per year through just the first 3 quarters of the year. The performance of the business continues to meet expectations as mature accounts are managed diligently and start-up accounts are progressing as expected. We continue to see pressure on equipment and maintenance-related expenses and that remains an area of focus.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the performance and remain excited about executing our plan to grow the business as we deliver exceptional value to our customers.\nShifting to Final Mile. As we've discussed for the last several quarters, our focus has been on delivering exceptional service but ensuring the quality -- revenue is aligned with the value we deliver to customers. While much work has been done, I am pleased with the progress. Much work remains though. Overall, we saw good demand for Final Mile Services in the quarter in our off-price retail channel with fulfillment as well as the appliance and furniture delivery market.\nSimilar to DCS, the sales activity is moderating some and we will manage accordingly. Going forward, we remain focused on our profit improvement initiatives while investing in a differentiated service experience for our customers to deliver value to each of them.\nClosing with some general comments on operations. We have seen improvements in the areas around professional driver recruiting and retention, although it elevated cost. That said, we have not seen much improvement in equipment availability, which continues to put pressure on our maintenance cost. We are still holding trades on several thousand trucks, which were required to support our growth over the last 2 years. We will make progress in this area over the next year, but we will be dependent upon how much equipment is needed to support our growth.\nThat concludes my remarks so I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nExecutive VP & President of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll review performance of our Intermodal business, including an update on network fluidity and the opportunities we have to deliver exceptional capacity and value to our customers. I'll start by reviewing the performance from the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity continued to support growth in our business despite challenges related to rail velocity, customer unloading activity and overall supply chain uncertainties facing our customers. Volumes for the quarter were up 4% year-over-year and by month were plus 4% in July, plus 6% in August and down 2% in September. Today, so far in October, volumes have rebounded from weaker demand in September.\nLast quarter, we discussed the challenges we were facing from a rail network velocity perspective, and I expressed confidence and a bit of optimism that it would get better. While we are not back to where we need to be, I am pleased to say that we saw a meaningful improvement in velocity and performance from BNSF as the quarter progressed, but in particular, in mid-August and throughout the remainder of the quarter. We continue to work with our primary channel providers at the most senior levels to improve our service quality and reliability, which presents our organization significant opportunities that I will address next.\nRecognizing John's comments about the shift in market balance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers with our Intermodal service offering. With greater velocity in our network, we are presented with an opportunity to remove meaningful costs in our business due to lack of productivity. As I've said before, our customers will participate in those savings while also benefiting from faster and more reliable service. We think this puts us in a position to be able to deliver meaningful value for our customers as they look for cheaper, more efficient and the most sustainable way of moving their freight.\nAs we stand here today, I'm confident that customers have greater demand for our capacity as speed and reliability improve. And I believe we have a greater line of sight to that now than at any other point over the last 2 years.\nIn closing, I would like to drive home the point that our business and our rail channel providers all benefit from service quality improvements, and we remain motivated and incentivized to deliver it. We have significant productivity and cost saving opportunities that will present themselves in our dray operations as rail service quality makes further improvements. I look forward to discussing our progress in this area in the quarters ahead.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. So I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nExecutive VP & President of Highway Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I'll also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360.\nStarting off with ICS, top line revenue was down 11% comprised of an 8% decline in volume and a 4% decline in revenue per load.\nDiving into those numbers a little deeper, truckload volume in the quarter was down only 1%. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see pressure in the spot or transactional market and volume but also in rate and margin. Similar to last quarter, our published or contractual volume was up double digits on a percentage basis year-over-year in the quarter, offset by our spot or transactional business down double digits.\nWe continue to manage the business to outperform the market, and we accomplished that against our benchmarks during the quarter. As John discussed, we are seeing a shift in balance in the market or a pivot, as I'd like to say, and we are navigating through that, but remain focused on our long-term goals and targets. I remain confident in our people and our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, to deliver an efficient and valued service offering to our customers.\nShifting over to Truckload. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see steady and solid demand for our drop trailer network service offering we call J.B. Hunt 360box. Volume grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to believe customers are finding value in the blending of their live network and drop trailer network capacity needs, essentially offering customers the flexibility and ease of use of a drop trailer for use in less dense freight lanes while also offering access to the vast amount of capacity available on our J.B. Hunt 360 platform for freight that would typically be handled by large asset-based carriers. One simple and seamless solution provided by experienced managers of trailing assets and powered by one of the largest capacity sourcing platforms, J.B. Hunt 360, which I'll touch on next.\nWe continue to see the strong usage and activity on our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360. As we've entered this new market paradigm, we are seeing the expected shifts in usage, including increased offers per load, but also carrier stickiness and measurable data on our ability to buy capacity against the market. Being a little more transparent, over the last 2 years, our customers relied on our platform to find capacity when it was extremely difficult and challenging to source. We were the go-to, and in this market pivot, admittedly, we may have had too much exposure to spot and project-related business. We will make adjustments and pivot ourselves where needed, but remain confident to investments in our people, technology and assets to support our long-term growth.\nThat concludes my comments so I'll turn it back to Brad Delco to give instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I'd just like to remind all the participants on the call that we're going to do one question and then move on to the next since we have such a long list of folks. So with that, Tia, we're ready to open it up for questions."

Thank you for attending today's J.B. Hunt's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amber, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I now have the pleasure of handing the conference over to our host, Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance with J.B. Hunt. Brad, please proceed.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1955. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNow I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening remarks. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter despite challenges around key factors of our business, including labor, equipment availability and rail service. The quarter did present evidence of a cyclical shift in market balance in certain areas of our business, and we see macro data that informs us about our current position such as spot rates and used truck values. That said, and most importantly, our results for the quarter continued to reveal the changes we have worked to implement to enhance our position in each segment of the company based on lessons learned and experiences gained over many, many years and cycles.\nThere are different characteristics of our business segments that should be complementary to the needs of our customers in all economic conditions. These include a flexible, much lighter asset position in our Highway Services offerings, compelling solutions for private fleet conversions, aiding in the nuances of managing advanced transportation networks, a more economical and carbon-friendly full-load services offering in intermodal and a final mile delivery position that addresses a secularly growing demand channel. We remain in a leadership position across our many businesses and from a position of strength financially and on the team's experience and ability to navigate through an ever-changing, constantly evolving global supply chain. I am encouraged to be in healthy, cash-generating businesses across the company.\nLet me address the clear service challenges we are experiencing with our rail providers. We are in active discussions with the highest levels of our primary rail providers to continue our work on improving service reliability and velocity. We remain confident that the right decisions and investments will be made to bring us back to where we need to be. We remain committed to the path we are on with intermodal and have made no changes to our plans with the expectations for the noted improvements to show through in the second half of this year.\nIn fact, at this point, we have made no alterations to our plans for the year in our equipment and capital expenditure allocations. While we acknowledge there are timing and delivery challenges, we take a long view and know that we have extended needs in all categories for replacement and growth assets. This position recognizes so-called crosswinds we are experiencing as noted and will be covered more during this call. Our direction is fully informed, using real-time data on all key aspects of each business and input from our customers.\nOur leadership team is here and will cover each business more specifically for you. But before that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his thoughts on the quarter. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & CAO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will review our recent performance in the quarter on a consolidated basis, and I'll also provide a quick update on our CapEx plans and our priorities for capital. Overall, we are pleased with the strong results the team was able to deliver in the quarter, highlighted with revenue growth of 32%, operating income growth of 46% and GAAP earnings per share growth of 50%.\nWe did incur too large, but partially offsetting income statement items in the quarter. First, we incurred a $30 million increase in casualty claims, which is recorded in the insurance and claims line of our income statement. And second, we recorded an $11.6 million workers' compensation insurance benefit in the salaries, wages and benefits line. We've discussed the net impact of $18.4 million in our release and provided the net impact by segment in those respective sections.\nWe're equally pleased with our efforts in continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet, with leverage below our net debt target of 1x EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis. We ended the quarter with $124 million of cash and 0 drawn on our revolving credit facility. You'll note our $350 million 2022 notes mature in the coming quarter, and we are reviewing our plans to retiring these notes but are not concerned on liquidity matters given our options.\nOn CapEx, we continue to be slightly behind our plan of $1.5 billion that we forecasted for the year. But as John alluded to, we remain committed to that target for both replacement and growth needs to service and grow with customers. The lag in CapEx versus plan is almost entirely due to the challenges in obtaining equipment.\nAs a reminder, our priorities for our capital remain focused on building long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and our people. We are able to accomplish this by remaining disciplined in allocating our capital to generate fair and reasonable returns to support reinvestment in our business, which remains priority number one. We bought back almost 1 million shares of stock in the quarter as opportunities were presented and remain committed to buybacks and dividends as a capital management tool as supported by our Board.\nThis concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley.\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nChief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & HR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will cover current market conditions and how we continue to have confidence in our position across our scroll of services to provide value for our customers. I'll also provide an update on our priorities across the key areas of our business, which are our people, technology and capacity, and how the combination of all 3 allow us to differentiate ourselves and delivering exceptional value to our customers.\nThe freight market remains dynamic and continues to be presented with unique and evolving challenges at different cross-sections of the broader supply chain. Labor availability, network velocity (inaudible) in addition to bearing inventory dynamics around product mix continue to put strain on the effective utilization of available capacity.\nSome trends we identified last quarter like a softer transactional spot market remain, but what also remains is a healthy demand for our intermodal capacity and our professionally outsourced private fleet solution in DCS and the frictionless way we connect customers with capacity in our Highway Services businesses by leveraging our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. The businesses we are in today across our entire scroll were not built or created overnight. Careful thought, planning and execution with durability, strength of financial discipline were and remain top of mind.\nWe do recognize that broader demand trends are a concern, and we continue to have frequent and open dialogue with our customers regarding their capacity needs. We remain optimistic on our ability to compete to deliver the best value to our customers by offering a full suite of services across the scroll that can help eliminate waste, create efficiencies and drive that cost from the system.\nLast quarter, I said our opportunity to provide and create efficiencies for our customers is greater this year than at any point over the last 2. And that remains true today. Freight has been moving inefficiently, creating additional costs. And we continue to see tremendous opportunity to eliminate waste in the system. Enhanced visibility, powered by the largest multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360, remains a tremendous opportunity for customers to effectively source the capacity needs.\nDuring the quarter, we launched new foundational principles that helps define who we are as a company, what we strive for on behalf of our customers and what our employees should expect as a member of our organization. In fact, our innovative, entrepreneurial and [say-do] culture is founded on these principles. People you trust, technology that empowers and capacity to deliver. That is J.B. Hunt.\nIt is by no accident that people comes first as it is and remains our top priority to take care of our people who take care of and deliver value for our customers. We empower our people, our organization and our customers with investments in technology to help provide productivity and efficiencies in our collective processes. And finally, we continue to invest in our capacity to deliver on meeting the growing needs of our customers.\nI'll close in a similar fashion as I did last quarter. We believe our mode in different approach allows us to provide flexible solutions to dynamically meet and respond to the need of our customers. Our investments in our people, technology and physical capacity have us in the best position to provide the right solutions for our customers in the 3 key areas of cost, capacity and service.\nThat concludes my comments, and I'd now like to turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our dedicated and final mile segments and provide an update on our professional drivers and equipment and the impact it is having on our operations.\nI'll start with dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remained strong as evidenced by our continued growth in our fleet during the quarter. Our backlog and pipeline also remained strong.\nAfter selling 600 trucks in Q1, we sold slightly over 800 trucks in the second quarter. We talked last quarter about seeing solid momentum in the business, and that remains the case today as we continue to onboard new business. We've added nearly 2,200 trucks to our business in the last 12 months, which continues to stand out versus the competition.\nThis unprecedented demand and growth for our highly engineered fleet service has put a strain on the organization, and the team has responded extremely well to the challenge. Going forward, we will remain focused on operational excellence, attracting and retaining the best talent and executing our growth plan, which all supports the value we deliver to our customers.\nShifting to final mile. As we discussed earlier this year, our focus for '22 has been on revenue quality and making sure our investments in our differentiated service product is properly valued in the marketplace. I am pleased with our efforts and the success we have had so far to improve our profitability, but more work remains and remains a priority moving forward. We continue to see strong demand for our service with new customer opportunities in the pipeline, but we also have seen some softening demand in some end markets, mainly in the value furniture category.\nOur recent acquisition, Zenith Freight Lines, is performing well and is presenting good opportunities for future growth. Zenith contributed about $28 million of revenue in the quarter. Going forward, we will remain committed to providing an unmatched service in the industry, and we continue to make investments to support that effort. We believe this will support our long-term performance in this secularly growing piece of the supply chain.\nClosing with some general comments on operations. The driver market remains competitive and challenging, but it feels more stable than it has in a while but at considerably higher cost. That said, the equipment market remains extremely challenging, and we are having to manage intensely around the impact on our operations.\nTo support our replacement needs and the growth we've seen across our organization, we will be holding trades on roughly 4,000 tractors this year. Additionally, inflationary cost pressures on tires, parts, maintenance, technicians are meaningful. And the higher frequency of repairs as a result of an aging fleet is also impacting the utilization of our tractor equipment. We continue to work closely with our OEM providers to secure the safest and most fuel-efficient equipment we can in the most expeditious way possible.\nThat concludes my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nExecutive VP & President of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review performance of our Intermodal segment. I will also give you an update on current network dynamics, customer demand and capacity.\nI'll start by reviewing the performance of the Intermodal segment in the quarter. Demand for our capacity continues to be greater than our ability to serve that demand. After seeing modest improvements in both rail velocity and customer activity in the first quarter, we saw performance deteriorate throughout the second quarter. Box turns in the quarter were essentially flat versus the first quarter and underperformed our expectations.\nThat said, volumes by month for the quarter were up 4% in April, up 9% in May and up 10% in June on a year-over-year basis. We took delivery of an additional 1,300 containers in the quarter and expect to take delivery of more in the second half of the year as we continue to invest in capacity to meet the needs of our customers. While our network velocity and resulting volume performance were disappointing in the quarter, the system and programs we have in place continue to protect the significant investments we've made on behalf of our customers.\nAs we sit here today, we remain optimistic that rail performance and velocity will improve as the rails are not incentivized to move slower. Near and long-term growth opportunities for intermodal business continue to be in front of us, and our rail channel partners are well aware of those opportunities. As John mentioned, we are working closely with all levels of our rail channel partners to address the velocity challenges.\nStarting early next year as new capacity becomes available to us on BNSF, we fully anticipate filling that available capacity, which is supported by feedback from our customers. When rail velocity does improve, we fully expect to improve available capacity but also demand for that available capacity as service levels improve. As inefficiencies are removed from the network, we fully expect that to be reflected in our cost to serve customers and rightfully so in the cost to our customers.\nIn closing, our Intermodal product continues to present a strong value proposition to customers with significant capacity to serve their needs in a more sustainable, efficient and carbon-friendly way. We will continue to prioritize investments needed to support our long-term growth and to better serve our customer needs. We believe our service backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nExecutive VP & President of Highway Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services.\nWhile we did see a market shift in the quarter, specifically related to spot opportunities, we believe our investments in our people, technology and assets helped us deliver a great and demanded service from our customers, which I'll touch on at the end of my comments.\nBut first, let's dive into ICS. ICS top line revenue growth was 3%, comprised of a 3% decline in volume, more than offset by a 5% increase in revenue per load. Unpacking that a little more, our Truckload volumes were also down about 3%, but this was largely a function of the shift I referenced earlier.\nOur contractual Truckload business increased an upper teens percent year-over-year, while our spot business was down mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. We made a call earlier this year to focus on the published side of our business, which we believe was the right strategic move. That said, we did adjust the dial's mid-quarter on some of our platform parameters and saw improvement in spot-rated freight trends as the quarter progressed.\nWe will continue to target the right and appropriate balance between volume growth and profitability, and our goal remains to outperform industry trends over the long term on growth, but more importantly, on delivering value to customers. I am confident with the power of our people and the technology investments in our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to drive increased efficiency and value and our service offering to help us deliver our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nShifting over to Truckload. We continue to see evidence of our customers valuing our drop trailer network service offering. Volume growth of 14% in the quarter supports that view. We see tremendous opportunity as customers begin to think differently about the blending of their live network and drop trailer network capacity needs. We believe that we have the right experience managing trailing assets in a complex network business. We've gained that experience in our Intermodal business, but in this instance, leveraging all the capacity and capability of our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source the most efficient capacity for our customers versus the rail network. This shift from an asset-intensive to an asset-light model supports our goal of scaling a large business with fair and acceptable rates of return on our capital.\nIn closing, I would just like to reiterate our strong belief that the blending of what has historically been separate networks, live load and unload freight versus drop trailer, freight remains in strong demand and is valued by our customers. We remain committed to investing in our people, technology and assets to support this growth.\nThat concludes my comments, so I'll turn it back to Brad to give some instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. (Operator Instructions) We have a lot of folks on the call this afternoon. So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. Amber? Thank you."

Thank you for attending today's J.B. Hunt First Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast. My name is Hannah, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B.

This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We see the start of 2022 and this first quarter report as both encouraging and revealing. While overall labor and other supply chain issues have continued, we leveraged experience, focus and technology to move through this period with success.\nExecution across all disciplines within the organization is running at solid performance levels, yet we have clear opportunities for improvement. Our equipment utilization continues to underperform due to consistent challenges with philosophy and the persistency for new driver hires.\nWe added 1,889 net drivers during 2021 and have so far increased our driver force by just over 1,400 this year. Our hiring teams are built out to levels not seen before in our history. The increased ability to improve hiring performance are enabled by the increases in driver compensation, improved benefits, reliable schedules with predictable home time and a company environment centered on growth for future career expansion.\nFor the past 18 months, our entire people and human resources discipline has been in a comprehensive refresh, presenting the opportunity to make meaningful changes in the quality of services these capable teams can bring to the most critical area of our business, all of our people, current and new.\nAs noted, we announced a multiyear expansion plan for our Intermodal fleet recently, coinciding with the renewed commitment between BNSF and JBHT. The opportunities that lie ahead in serving our customers are rejuvenated by this commitment, and we anticipate leveraging this unique and industry-leading position. The transportation dynamics of driver shortages and increasing labor costs, high fuel prices, congestion, reliable capacity, not to mention the remarkable impacts that Intermodal has in the Scope 3 emission reductions for our shippers gives us confidence in our decisions here.\nAnother important recent development is the formation of our Inclusion Council consisting of a highly cross-functional group of managers and executives whose purpose is to continue to guide the organization towards new awareness and actions. This will no doubt make us a better company.\nOur leadership team is here and will cover each business more specifically for you. But before that, I will turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his thoughts on the quarter. John?\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & CAO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will review our recent performance in the quarter, providing some additional perspective to the results on a consolidated level. I'll provide a quick update on capital expenditure plans for the year, and then I'll spend a little bit more time talking about our priorities around our capital allocation in light of recent market events and opportunities we see to capitalize on long-term sustainable growth in our business.\nOverall, we are pleased with our performance for the first quarter of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 33% and operating income growth of 61% versus the prior year period. These results were tempered by some fairly meaningful labor challenges at the start of the quarter related to Omicron variant outbreak. The most notable impact from this challenge was in our DCS business as driver availability and productivity were impacted.\nWe also saw challenges in our rail velocity and Intermodal and in product availability in our FMS network. That said, the market tightness presented our highway businesses opportunities to step in to meet customer needs and our technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, provided us an efficient effective avenue to source capacity for and on behalf of our customers. This continues to prove out the resiliency of our multimodal business model and our broader, mode-agnostic supply chain solutions offering.\nWe have discontinued providing COVID-related costs on a quarterly basis a few quarters ago as the numbers were not meaningful to our consolidated results, but we did incur a little over $7 million in direct COVID-related costs for paid time off for those needing quarantine and also for those needing time to get vaccinated in the quarter.\nWeather also presented some challenges to our network businesses, but no more or less than what we had expected given our line of work. I would say, similar to my comments last quarter, labor continues to be an area with the greatest inflationary pressure in both professional driver and nondriver salary wages and benefits, and we expect that trend to continue throughout the remainder of the year.\nIn the first quarter, we recognized approximately $18 million of gains on sale of equipment in the quarter, which are atypical for us. We had very few trades last year as we hold most of our equipment to support our organic growth. Below the line, our tax rate was 24.4%, slightly lower, while our interest expense was modestly higher year-over-year, netting us to GAAP EPS of $2.29 or a 67% increase year-over-year.\nContinuing to maintain a strong balance sheet with $145 million of cash, 0 drawn on our revolver and up to $750 million capacity on the revolver and our net debt balance remains below our targeted level of 1x trailing EBITDA at 0.6. Last quarter, I provided CapEx plans of $1.5 billion for the year. And while we are slightly behind plan through the first quarter due to continued constraints and equipment availability, $1.5 billion remains our target for 2022.\nA quick update on our capital allocation priorities is that it hasn't changed. We will continue to prioritize supporting the growth of our business with reinvestment as needed, remaining committed to our investments in capacity to help serve our growing customer base. We recently increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 a share or 33% from prior levels and keeping with our dividend strategy.\nWe also intend to incorporate mindful share repurchases and opportunistically execute on M&A opportunities. We remain conservatively leveraged to maintain our investment-grade rating. However, we are not afraid to increase leverage as opportunities arise.\nI'd like to reemphasize that investments in our business will continue to be supported by sound financial discipline and maintaining fair and reasonable returns on our invested capital. This keeps our business strong, healthy and capable of growing to meet the growing needs of our customers.\nThis concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley.\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nChief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & HR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions and how we are serving our customers' needs by leveraging our investments in our people, our physical assets and our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360. I'll provide an update on bid season, which will provide some insight into our expectations for the year. And finally, I'll provide some priorities that our organization will be focused on achieving this year for our people and for and on behalf of our customers.\nAs has been the case much of the last 2 years, the market remains extremely dynamic, as also evidenced by our experience in the first quarter with disruptions across the supply chain related to the Omicron variant, weather events across the network, labor availability and rapidly rising fuel and commodity costs. We believe our mode-agnostic approach with our assets and technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, both of which are powered and enabled by our people, allow us to dynamically meet and respond to the needs of our customers.\nAs the quarter progressed, the market finally began to find more balance, which was evidenced by the expansion in margin we saw in our Highway Services segment. As we have discussed for some time, freight has been moving inefficiently over the last 2 years, creating additional costs for our customers and additional costs for our business.\nFive years ago, we launched internally our cycle of innovation to disrupt, adapt and to accelerate, which happened to coincide with the launch of J.B. Hunt 360. As we hit the 5-year anniversary for J.B. Hunt 360, I'd like to reflect on our journey and our investments. The investments we have made are intended to disrupt our industry. We, as an organization, had to adapt and make sure we had the right organizational structure and processes in place to execute our strategy.\nA month before the pandemic began, our organization transitioned to the theme accelerate. Going forward, we will continue with our current theme to accelerate. We will accelerate the speed at which we serve our customers, accelerate our investments in areas with promising long-term growth potential and accelerate our ability to react to the needs of our customers. Under this theme of acceleration, we will remain focused on opportunities to add value to our customers as our people, technology and assets come together to provide highly engineered cost-saving solutions. We believe this remains the right recipe for long-term compounding sustainable growth, and we will continue to approach the market that way while maintaining our financial discipline on fair and appropriate returns on our capital.\nWe are now almost halfway through bid season, and we're extremely encouraged by the feedback and the confidence that our customers have in us to deliver an efficient and cost-effective solution for their shipping needs. As we sit here today, demand for our services and, in particular, the asset side of our business, is the strongest I've seen in my 27-year career at the company. And this demand continues to put pressure on our need for more equipment and people.\nGoing forward, we have a lot of confidence in our plan to grow our capacity. And we believe it's a matter of when, not if, some of the labor challenges, which includes our rail providers, will moderate and ultimately assist us with improved fluidity. With elevated energy prices, customers are needing and expecting a lot from us, but capacity in an intermodal network remains extremely tight. Thankfully, our scroll of services allow us to continue to offer capacity solutions and say yes to our customers with our ability to source that capacity in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360.\nFinally, I want to take some time to provide you some of our priorities for the year. As I discussed last quarter, we believe that market dynamics will present us with a lot of opportunities to grow, and that remains the case today as well as a priority. But I also believe our opportunity to provide and create efficiencies for our customers is greater this year than at any point in the last 2 years.\nOur investments in our container fleet, trailing fleet, technology and people have us in the best position to provide the right solutions for our customers in 3 key areas: cost, capacity and service, more than any point since the beginning of this pandemic. I strongly believe in our team's ability to execute for and on behalf of our customers, delivering value and efficient solutions, and this will remain our priority as well as it has always. This strategy, combined with our financial discipline, gives us even greater confidence as we have set out to achieve our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nThat concludes my comments. I'd now like to turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. Today, I'm going to review the performance of both our Dedicated and Final Mile segments as well as give some updated thoughts on current trends in some of our high-level expectations as we move throughout the year. I will also provide some perspective on the current challenges we face and the industry are facing in sourcing both equipment and professional drivers. I'll start my comments on Dedicated.\nAt the expense of sounding like a broken record, our Dedicated business continues to have a lot of momentum as our backlog and pipeline for new business and start-ups continues to build to record levels. After coming off a record year of selling roughly 2,500 trucks in 2021, the first quarter kept pace with around 600 trucks sold in what is normally a slower time of the year for new business sales. As it pertains to the results in the quarter, revenue grew 28%, driven primarily by the average fleet size that was about 2,000 trucks or 20% larger than a year ago, which I believe is a true standout for our organization and in the industry.\nMargins in the quarter remained under pressure despite improving sequentially as a result of start-up costs as we onboarded almost half the accounts in the first quarter than what we did all of last year. I will also share that our operations and productivity were negatively impacted by labor challenges brought on by Omicron variant in January and weather events in February. That only added to some of the start-up expenses we incurred. That said, and hopefully, with COVID and weather events largely behind us, we saw performance and momentum out of the segment in March, which we believe should carry forward.\nOur new accounts onboarded last year are performing as expected, which gives us confidence in our approach to the market, and our annual price escalators will continue to protect us against broader inflationary pressures. Our concerns remain on both equipment and labor availability, namely professional drivers as our needs for both remain extremely elevated and may ultimately govern our pace of growth if demand remains or accelerates from current levels.\nIn terms of priorities going forward, we will remain focused on the execution of our growth plan as well as maintaining our culture of operational excellence, high service and safety, which supports the value we deliver to our customers.\nShifting to Final Mile. Revenue grew about 8% versus previous year period, driven by newly awarded accounts over the last year, but offset by some of the supply chain challenges impacting some of the primary markets we serve in this segment, namely appliances and furniture. We also announced and closed on the acquisition of Zenith Freight lines in the quarter, which contributed about $10 million in revenue for the 1 month it was consolidated in our results.\nWe continue to make investments in our service quality and performance in order to differentiate ourselves in the market. We believe these investments are wise over the long term as safety and service will be the cornerstone to our long-term growth and success.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we are coming off a strong year of new business sales, giving us confidence in our differentiated service product. This confidence supported our decision to put some of our underperforming business at risk which we have done over the last few months. While it's too early to come to conclusions on all the underperforming accounts, we have been successful at getting meaningful rate increases at several accounts that should support better earnings and margin performance ahead. We remain focused on generating appropriate financial returns on our business so we can reinvest to provide more capacity and services for our customers. Going forward, our priorities remain investing in the business to support its growth but with some greater emphasis on improving the profitability in this segment in 2022.\nClosing out with some operational updates. As I alluded to in my dedicated comments, the equipment market and professional driver market remain extremely tight. We have clearly had success growing our equipment levels and professional driver workforce to meet the most of the needs of our Intermodal and Dedicated businesses. But let me be clear, it hasn't been easy, and it certainly hasn't been cheap. We have relied heavily on some of our key OEMs to help support our growth. But I'm afraid it's not enough, and we're exploring new suppliers across all of our areas of need to support our growth.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nExecutive VP & President of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. My comments this afternoon will recap the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter. I will also want to give some comments on our recent joint announcement with the BNSF to improve intermodal capacity challenges and what our priorities are for the business as we continue to invest in our people and capacity for meeting the strong and growing demand for intermodal services in the months, quarters and years ahead.\nI'll start with the performance of the Intermodal segment in the quarter. Demand for the intermodal capacity remained extremely strong throughout the first quarter, and importantly, it remains so today. As has been the case for some time, our ability to execute on all of the demand for our intermodal capacity was hampered by rail velocity and, to a lesser extent, the detention of our equipment from customers. Box turns did deteriorate sequentially from fourth quarter, which is in line with seasonality, but nonetheless, still disappointing at current levels.\nThe Omicron variant did impact labor availability for our rail providers and our customers and in our operations as well. And thankfully, those trends did improve as the quarter progressed, particularly for our customers as well as in our operations.\nVolumes for the month -- for the quarter were down 1% in January, plus 17% in February and plus 6% in March. Keep in mind, February was a fairly easy comp due to some weather events in 2021. We were successful at onboarding over 4,300 containers in the quarter, and I am proud of our team for their execution on that front, which puts us in better position to meet the growing needs of our customers. We plan on taking delivery of the remaining balance of the 6,000 containers from our 2021 order during the second quarter. We did see approximately $14 million in gains on sale of equipment, which is unusual for us, but nonetheless should be transparently disclosed. Importantly, the core of our business is performing well in light of the inflationary and fluidity challenges facing the business and network, which is supported by our people running the operations and our customers who value our service offering.\nDuring the last quarter, J.B. Hunt and BNSF announced a joint initiative to substantially improve capacity in the intermodal marketplace while meeting the expanding needs of our current customers. This is an important moment for our organization as the largest railroad and domestic intermodal carrier will be collaborating even more closely together to provide an unparalleled intermodal product, leveraging the talents, skills and technologies of both companies to provide a seamless door-to-door solutions for our customers.\nWith some channel partners leaving the BNSF network, we were provided an opportunity and have developed a plan to grow our intermodal container count to 150,000 in the next 3 to 5 years. This represents 40% growth from our count at the end of 2021. For the record, let me state the easiest thing we can do is go out and buy more containers. This will be a significant endeavor for our organization and will require investment in people, equipment and technology to get our desired outcomes. Importantly, these investments will be done with the same financial discipline as in the past. Needless to say, I'm excited and energized for our organization as we grow to meet the needs of our customers.\nAs we look forward, I thought I would share a little bit of perspective about our priorities for Intermodal this year. As Shelley discussed, we are encouraged by the level of demand we are seeing throughout the bid process for our capacity, which continues to give us confidence to make investments. We strongly believe in the value proposition we can deliver on the 3 key items our customers care about, which is cost, capacity and service.\nAs it stands today, there are inefficiencies across the supply chain and within the rail network that is impacting velocity. We are cautiously optimistic that velocity will improve which will create more capacity for our customers while improving efficiencies and costs in our operations. Simply put, this is a good outcome for our rail providers, our customers and for J.B. Hunt. We will continue to prioritize investments needed to support our growth to help us meet the robust demand we are seeing for intermodal capacity.\nIn closing, Intermodal's value proposition remains strong, supporting our view of long-term sustainable growth. We continue to see ample opportunities to convert highway freight as well as transloading cargo into our domestic containers. We believe our service, backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment, is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nExecutive VP & President of Highway Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the performance of our Highway Service businesses, which includes both integrated capacity solutions and trucks. We continue to see tremendous opportunity to leverage our investments in our people, assets and technology to support the growth opportunities presented to us by our customers. As evidenced by our results, I think we were able to demonstrate that in the first quarter. So with that, let me go ahead and dive into the performance of the segments that make up Highway and provide some perspective on our priorities moving forward as well as some perspective on the market currently.\nI'd like to start with truck at JBT. Revenue grew 77% year-over-year to $264 million, while operating income improved to $31.5 million in the quarter. This represents some of the strongest quarterly performances in the segment going back to 2005, yet with less than 20% of the company trucks or assets than we had running in the segment at that time. This continues to support our decision to invest in trailing assets for this segment while leveraging our investments in our technology, specifically J.B. Hunt 360, to source the most efficient capacity to move freight for and on behalf of our customers.\nAs Shelley mentioned in her comments, demand for our trailing assets, which is our 360box product, remains strong as customers continue to realize the efficiencies and benefits of giving us a holistic view of their freight and allow us to blend their live and drop trailer networks with a single-source solution. We continue to see strong customer demand for this product and service offering as they recognize these benefits.\nGoing forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our people, growing our trailing fleet and leveraging our technology to support long-term sustainable growth in the segment while maintaining our financial discipline around acceptable returns on invested capital. To close out on JBT, you might have noticed an update to some of the stats we shared on this segment, which we believe better aligns with how the business has transformed with the introduction of our 360box service offering by managing a trailing capacity fleet and sourcing the most efficient capacity to move it for our customers, whether it's our truck or asset or someone else's.\nShifting gears now to ICS. We delivered $675 million of revenue in the quarter, with year-over-year growth of 29% versus the prior year period. This growth was driven by more balance between volumes and revenue per load than in our more recent periods as our segments volume grew 12% year-over-year. Specific to truckload volumes, our growth was 15% versus the prior year period.\nWe have seen a moderation in spot opportunities as of late, which we attribute partly to more customer shifting freight out of the spot market into published or contractual business but also recognizing a movement in the market towards more balance. Taking that a step further for the quarter, our published business was up more than 20% while our spot business was up low single digits. That said, we continue to see record levels of freight opportunities from our customers to execute in our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, which we think demonstrates the power of our platform to source the most efficient means of moving freight for and on behalf of our customers. Going forward, we will continue to focus on leveraging our people and our technology to provide an efficient solution for our customers. We believe this will support our long-term growth and will be supported by fair and adequate returns on invested capital.\nIn closing, I'd like to leave you with our confidence to continue to invest in the areas I've highlighted for you, and that is our trailing capacity, our people and our technology. We continue to see how each complements one another to provide the most efficient solution for our customers. Our customers have and always will remain focused on cost, capacity and service. And if we can differentiate ourselves and deliver on all 3, we believe that is the right recipe for long-term compounding sustainable growth. As we continue to deliver on our value proposition for customers, we stay true to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nThat concludes my comments, so I'll turn it back to the operator to open the call for Q&A."

Welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, Mr. Brad Delco. Please go ahead.\n\nA. Brad Delco\n\nVP of Finance & IR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People of Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\n\nJohn N. Roberts\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We all thought 2020 was a remarkable year in our history, but I'll consider 2021 as a good contender for being equally challenging. And in the midst of perpetual challenge, we have continued to see our collective resiliency and strength carriers during these unique times. Our teams have adjusted and adapted to multiple scenario changes impacting our customers' ability to thrive.\nIn 2021, our leaders made bold calls to increase investments in our people, our technologies and expanding our fleets across our asset base. We have long been committed to following a disciplined approach for all capital allocations and believe these investments are good for our customers in the long term.\nI can't say enough about the way every one of our team members has risen to the opportunities presented in this current environment. Accordingly, we have done exhaustive research on where we stand regarding being competitive in total compensation for our people as we move into 2022. Our team leaders have unilaterally approved comprehensive changes to our base wages, incentive compensation and benefits. Increasing our awareness for how we are tracking and retaining the best talent is critical to our mission of creating the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nThe overall growth we experienced in 2021 is unprecedented. Once again, revealing the necessity of our services and confirming the approach our people take on solving our customers' challenges. We added 1,778 tractors to DCS, 6,284 containers in intermodal with 531 net tracker adds, and 2,605 trailers for our 360box program in highway. We continue to work strategically with our equipment providers on build and delivery plans as we head into 2022.\nWith the growth coming out of '21, we anticipate ongoing demand for all types of power and trading equipment. We also look forward to working with our rail service providers to find improvements across all aspects of intermodal service, capacity management and utilization.\nLastly, I will comment on our efforts relating to sustainability. Over the past several years, we have worked to better understand, communicate and advance our positioning in this important area. While we have seen good progress and have been recognized by many third parties for our efforts, we also believe we have important work to do. We are committed to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America, and we are also committed to being transparent on the progress of our sustainability journey.\nThis concludes my remarks. Our executives will provide more specific information. So I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow.\n\nJohn Kuhlow\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Controller & CAO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will follow a similar pattern as our previous calls, where I'll review our recent performance on a consolidated level. I'll then provide some commentary on our CapEx plans for 2022, and as well as our approach to allocation. And then I'll close with some thoughts on our financial priorities for the coming year.\nOverall, we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, highlighted by growing revenues, 28%, and operating income, 55%, over the prior year period. We saw positive year-over-year revenue performance across all segments, and positive operating income performance in all segments, except for DCS, which Nick will cover in greater detail in his remarks.\nAs I look across our business, the common denominator in terms of our pain points continues to be labor-related in wages, salaries, benefits and recruiting trends in both driver and non-driver. We continue to elevate investments in our people, as was evidenced by our decision to provide a special bonus in December of nearly $11 million to our frontline workers for their efforts in working through the supply chain challenges facing our customers and the industry.\nBelow the line, interest expense was slightly lower and the tax rate is slightly higher in the prior period, resulting in GAAP EPS of $2.28 a share for the quarter or a 58% increase versus the prior year period.\nAs has been stated in previous calls, the impacts of network congestion, labor shortages and general supply chain challenges are well known and have continued to have a meaningful impact on our business and are likely to persist, particularly given the heightened challenges evolving around COVID infections across our country. We ended the quarter with $356 million of cash, which was slightly higher than planned. Last quarter, I provided you with updated thoughts on our 2021 net CapEx, and that would fall within the $1 billion range, which we missed by approximately $130 million. This miss was almost entirely due to supply chain delays continuing to impact our ability to take timely delivery of our equipment.\nWe remain committed to these investments and capacity to help serve our customers, and we anticipate net CapEx for 2022 to approximate $1.5 billion. We continue to prioritize our capital to invest in our business, support our dividend, repurchase shares and opportunistically execute on our M&A strategy, all while maintaining a modest net leverage ratio of around 1x EBITDA. And importantly, continuing to maintain our investment-grade status.\nBefore I close out my comments, and in light of expecting some questions around our 2022 outlook, I'd like to provide you some context, not guidance, but context for our financial priorities in 2022. These priorities include continuing investments in our people, maintaining a strong balance sheet to support all of our planned investments and focusing on generating appropriate returns on the capital we are investing to grow our businesses and serve our customers. This disciplined focus on the priorities enables us to manage the business for long-term growth and success.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Shelley.\n\nShelley Simpson\n\nChief Commercial Officer and Executive VP of People & HR, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon. Today, I want my commercial update to focus first on a quick review of 2021 to how we are able to deliver for our customers. I will then focus my comments on the market and how we're going to approach the ongoing supply chain challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Finally, I'll finish up with some updates on our priorities for J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform as we move forward.\nAs we've discussed over the past year, the freight environment has been extremely volatile and unpredictable, and not just for capacity providers, but also for those that we are providing capacity for to meet their needs. In this environment, we, as an organization like our customers have had to adapt to this disruption, and I firmly believe that our mode agnostic, comprehensive supply chain solutions approach has been a key to help our customers over the last year, where we were able to honor our commitments and particularly during peak season.\nAnother key element of our success was a significant commitment and investment in physical assets across all of our business segments from containers and chassis to trucks and trailers. That said, I would be remiss to leave out the most critical element of our success, and that is our people, our drivers, mechanics, load planners and all of those behind the scenes, helping our frontline workers succeed. Tying it all together, of course, was our technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, which I believe gives us a distinct advantage in sourcing efficient capacity for our customers.\nSimply put, our investments, people and technology put us in a position to say yes in 2021, and has me excited for our future growth as more and more customers are leaning in.\nAs we look at the market today and try to prepare for the year ahead, many components of our business plan and go-to-market strategy are similar to those exercise here in our recent past. The market remains challenging, capacity constrained and unpredictable, and we will need to remain agile in our approach to securing capacity for our customers.\nSome unique areas us see impacting capacity is the ability to source new equipment, which is likely to keep used truck prices elevated, and as a result, small carrier rates as well. As customers wanting to lock up more capacity in dedicated arrangements and lean into technologies that drive efficiency in their supply chain and how they procure capacity. As an organization, we see tremendous pent-up demand to convert highway freight to intermodal with elevated truck rates, the tight labor market, higher fuel prices and a 60% improvement in carbon efficiency intermodal offers versus truck.\nNeedless to say, 2022 will present us with many opportunities to grow, and we will approach the market similar to how we always have, serving our customers as our top priority while maintaining sound financial discipline.\nFinally, as I look at the investments we've made building out and scaling J.B. Hunt 360, I continue to be encouraged where we are relative to our long-term plan. As we have discussed, user activity and engagement continue to accelerate and break records across both carrier and shipper platforms, solidifying the value of optimizing and transacting in real time, in a frictionless process.\nAs we look ahead to this year, we see opportunities to further acceleration as we continue to roll out of our new automated tools and to drive even greater efficiency in our organization and higher service quality for our customers. These tools will enable, enhance and leverage our people and core technologies to drive more efficiencies in the marketplace, which gets us even closer to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nTo wrap up, we continue to uncover innovative ways to accomplish that mission, including the collaborative work with Google and the recently announced strategic alliance with Waymo, where I see tremendous opportunity for us to explore solutions that merged 2 of the most innovative companies in the transportation industry, autonomous driving and our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360.\nThat concludes my comments, and I'd now like to turn it over to Nick.\n\nNicholas Hobbs\n\nPresident of Contract Services, Executive VP & COO, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. Today, I'm going to review the performance of both Final Mile and Dedicated segments, as well as provide some thoughts on the priorities for these businesses as we move forward. I will also provide some updated thoughts from an operational perspective on our ability to source equipment and some updated views on the driver market.\nI'll start with Final Mile. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, we have been focused on making the right investments in our people and processes to ensure a high level of service quality and execution for the safe and timely delivery of our customers' products into their customers' homes. That trend continued in Q4 as service quality and safety will be a cornerstone to the long-term growth and success of our business. These investments, labor challenges as well as supply chain disruptions for some key markets that we serve have continued to weigh on margin performance in the most recent quarter in addition to some start-up costs for some newer accounts.\nAs we set out to differentiate our service product, we've also set out to demonstrate the differentiated value we bring to our customers and the market. We believe some of that differentiation is being recognized as we are coming off our largest sales year for new business in 2021. That said, in the coming months, we do expect to put some business at risk as we focus and put even greater emphasis on generating the appropriate financial returns on these investments.\nGoing forward, we continue to see a solid pipeline of organic growth opportunities, with potential to supplement some of that growth with small tuck-in acquisitions as a way to build out our service capabilities and customer list.\nShifting to Dedicated. Our Dedicated business continues to have a lot of momentum as our backlog and pipeline for new business startups continue to build to record levels despite the onboarding of nearly 1,800 new trucks in 2021. In terms of truck sales, we sold over 2,500 trucks of new business in the year, a new record for us, or an incremental 663 units specifically in the fourth quarter.\nHistorically, we have shared a target to sell 800 to 1,000 trucks per year. And at this point, we feel it's appropriate to update that long-term target to 1,000 to 1,200 based on our team's ability to execute. As planned or expected, these startups do put near-term pressure on margin performance as does elevated driver pay and recruiting costs, and specific to the quarter, the special bonus we provided our frontline employees. But we remain confident in our ability to price and manage each of our accounts to their appropriate levels of profitability and returns, which should reveal itself in the coming quarters.\nIn terms of priorities going forward, we will remain focused on the execution of our growth plan, as well as maintaining our culture for operational excellence, high service and safety, while maintaining through some challenges around a modestly less experienced team as our pace of growth has been robust.\nClosing out with some operational updates. As you could tell by my dedicated comments, there's a lot of momentum, which has us put additional pressure on our organization to source both drivers and equipment. I would say that both the truck and trailer market, as well as the driver market, remains extremely tight and does give me some concern for our ability to execute on our growth plan to meet the demands of the business. That said, we are working closely with our OEMs to get delivery of product and continue to recruit tirelessly to meet the driver demands across our organization.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\n\nDarren P. Field\n\nExecutive VP & President of Intermodal, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dick. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, my comments will recap the performance of our Intermodal business in '21, and specifically, the fourth quarter. I will also provide an update on our significant investment to expand our capacity with our equipment orders and finish up with some thoughts about the outlook for the business in 2022 as we anticipate strong demand for our services as a result of our investments and the value of intermodal in the truck to rail conversion equation.\nI'd like to start by reviewing our recent performance. Demand for our intermodal service remained strong in the fourth quarter. But similar to recent trends, wasn't reflected in the volume performance for the business as network congestion and restrictions hindered a large amount of our potential capacity. That said, I am proud of our team and its ability to onboard the equipment available to us to ensure that we met the commitments to our customers during their peak period of demand.\nOn a positive note, we did see improvements in the quarter in parts of the network, specifically the speed in which customers were able to turn our equipment. However, those improvements were effectively offset by further deterioration in other parts of the network, namely rail velocity.\nFor the quarter, box turns achieved minimal improvement from the third quarter. Needless to say, lots of work remains to be done. As a result, volumes for the quarter were down 3% year-over-year. And by month, volumes were down 4% in October, down 3% in November and down 1% in December.\nThe onboarding of new equipment was slower than we anticipated, taking delivery of only 2,700 units in the quarter and approximately half of our 12,000 orders for the year. Naturally, this will push more units into our delivery plan for the first half of 2022. This investment in additional capacity and the corresponding investment in additional trucks and chassis, and most importantly, our people, puts us in a good position to serve our customers and focus on growth in '22.\nIn addition to these investments, we continue to work closely with our customers and rail service providers to improve velocity in the system to unlock the latent capacity in the network. Predicting the exact timing of improvement in the network fluidity is difficult, particularly in light of some of the more recent disruption caused by new COVID cases impacting our own and our customers' operations.\nAs we look forward to the year ahead, and similar to what you've heard earlier, we are optimistic about our opportunities to grow the business. We have executed a plan that puts us on a solid growth trajectory based on items within our control. Consistent with our strategy historically, we will focus on striking the right balance between volume and price, while maintaining our financial discipline on targeting appropriate returns on our business.\nOf course, returns and margins are impacted by items like velocity and asset utilization, which will also be a key component in terms of how we manage the business as we progress through the year. In anticipation of questions on both volume and margin expectations for the year, my answer is it depends. But know that the business will be managed to protect our investment and our returns on that investment.\nIn closing, intermodal's value proposition remains strong, supporting our view of long-term sustainable growth. We continue to see ample opportunities to convert highway freight, as well as transloading freight into our domestic containers. We believe our service, backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment, is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed.\nThat concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\n\nBradley W. Hicks\n\nExecutive VP & President of Highway Services, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the performance of Highway Services, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truck. But before I do, I would just like to stop for a second and thank all the members in ICS and JBT for how they continue to rise to the occasion to deliver on behalf of our customers, particularly during what was another tight and capacity constrained peak season.\nYou've heard us talk now for quite some time about how we plan on leveraging our investments in our people and our technology to support rapid growth in this area of our business. And as I look back on the past year, I couldn't be more pleased with how this team has responded to deliver on that statement.\nI'd like to first cover ICS or our Integrated Capacity Solutions segment. We delivered $739 million of revenue in the quarter with year-over-year growth of 26%. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in revenue per load as total loads were down 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Truckload volume was up 3% versus the prior year period.\nGoing into peak, we felt like our volume comps would decelerate based on our rapid growth a year ago from third to fourth quarter, in addition to some of the discipline we instilled in our bid strategy earlier in the year, which combined with scaling and productivity benefits, is reflected in our profitability improvement. As we look forward, I know our teams are excited about the rollout of 2 technology enhancements this year that will enable greater productivity of our people and greater service for our customers and carriers, which will support our growth and scaling of the business even further.\nTo close out my comments on ICS, I would like to establish some priorities for the year, which include continuing to invest in and leverage our people and technology, focus on operational excellence, so customers and carriers have a world-class experience utilizing the J.B. Hunt 360 platform, and create value for customers and carriers that would support further market share gains.\nShifting gears now to Truck or JBT. Revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $259 million, while operating income improved to $26 million in the quarter and delivering results this segment hasn't achieved since 2005. I think it's important to highlight that our go-to-market strategy has evolved as the makeup of our truck service offering has continued to gravitate to a more asset-light model. I remain encouraged by our ability to disrupt the traditional way of serving customers in this segment to discover new and innovative ways to scale into the large addressable drop trailer market that has normally been served by the large asset-based carriers.\nBy leveraging the power and investments we've made in our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, our people, and building out our 360box networking capacity, we are positioned for growth as financial returns support our strategy and further investment. Similar to ICS, these investments will focus on building out further capabilities with our technology, investing more in our people and investment in our physical assets, which, in this case, is additional trailing capacity. We will continue to maintain our discipline on our capital allocation in this area of investment, but I am encouraged by our progress and the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in the segment.\nIn closing, we continue to see a lot of opportunities in our Highway Services businesses to provide an efficient source of capacity for our customers, by leveraging our investments in our people and J.B. Hunt 360, our multimodal digital freight platform. As I said last quarter, much work has been done, but much more remains, and we will stay focused on delivering on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nThat concludes my comments, so I'll turn it back over to the operator to open the call for Q&A."

Welcome to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Lowenstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid L. Lowenstein\n\nAssistant Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Nikki. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2026 second quarter earnings conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Executive Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance.\nLet me remind you our statements today that are not statements of historical fact including, but not limited to, statements regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance, are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our current knowledge, expectations and assumptions and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nIn providing projections and other forward-looking statements, we disclaim any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors and risks that could affect these expectations, please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC this morning, our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2025 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q previously filed with the SEC.\nPlease note, in addition to our earnings release, we have also prepared our quarterly investor presentation, and both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations department at (804) 747-0422 extension 7865.\nLastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only 1 question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I want to start with our priorities.\nWhile our second quarter results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on driving sales, gaining market share and delivering significant year-over-year earnings growth for years to come. We have a differentiated and best-in-class omnichannel customer experience and are focused on maximizing that advantage by driving operational efficiency and sharpening our go-to-market approach.\nWith this mindset, our key priorities include: First, focusing on price and selection. This includes maintaining competitive prices while minimizing macro factor impact and having the cars consumers are looking for at CarMax's high-quality standards. Second, driving consumer awareness of our differentiated experience. This includes not only our new brand campaign Wanna Drive? but also enhancing the conversion waterfall from web traffic all the way to the ultimate buy and/or sell decision.\nThird, delivering incremental SG&A reductions of at least $150 million over the next 18 months. This will be broad-based, and it includes leveraging technology to drive efficiencies and our Net Promoter Score to new heights. And finally, generating additional profit through components of our diversified business. This includes increasing CAF penetration and profitability in a responsible and thoughtful way. It also includes pursuing other opportunities across our business to drive incremental flow-through to our bottom line.\nWe are already making progress across these fronts and are confident in our strategy and our earnings model, which will produce high teen EPS growth with mid-single-digit retail unit growth.\nDuring our first quarter call, I mentioned that we saw an uptick in sales volume in March and April due to the tariff speculation. This impacted our performance in the second quarter in 2 ways. First, we ramped our inventory ahead of the second quarter to support this growth. Across the back half of May through the end of June, we saw about $1,000 in depreciation, which natively impacted our price competitiveness and our sales.\nSecond, while hard to quantify, we believe there was a pull forward of demand into the first quarter. In the second quarter, we responded by lowering retail margin to drive sell-through, and we intentionally slowed buys to balance our inventory with sales. This strategy has worked as both price competitiveness and inventory position have improved since that time and have put us in a better position for the third quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered total sales of $6.6 billion, down 6% compared to last year, reflecting lower volume. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 5.4% and used unit comps were down 6.3%. Pressured performance across our age 0 to 5 inventory was partially offset by increased sales in older, higher mileage vehicles. Average selling price was $26,000, a year-over-year decrease of approximately $250 per unit.\nSecond quarter retail gross profit per used unit was similar to last year but down approximately $200 from the first quarter. The sequential decline was more than twice our historical average, reflecting the actions that I mentioned earlier. We will continue to focus on maintaining our price competitiveness, and we remain disciplined yet nimble in leveraging selection and margins to drive sales.\nWholesale unit sales were down 2.2% versus the second quarter last year. Average wholesale selling price increased approximately $125 per unit to $7,900 and wholesale gross profit per unit was historically strong and similar to last year.\nWe bought approximately 293,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from last year. We purchased approximately 262,000 vehicles from consumers, with more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our Edmond sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 31,000 vehicles through dealers, which is slightly up from last year. This quarter's buy performance is a direct result of a decision to pull back offers to rightsize inventory. We are no longer intentionally slowing buy and expect to see year-over-year improvement in the third quarter.\nAt the end of August, we launched our new Wanna Drive? brand position campaign that brings to light our unique omnichannel experience. Our Net Promoter Score is the highest it's been since we rolled out our digital capabilities nationwide, driven by record high satisfaction among customers purchasing online as well as those using our omnichannel experience. Wanna Drive? spotlights this unique offering, empowering customers to buy their way, with the clarity, confidence and control to navigate the journey on their terms. Wanna Drive? appears across TV, streaming social, digital and audio and represents the first phase of a sustained multiphase strategy. This approach, which we will complement with increased advertising spend, demonstrates our commitment to long-term brand investment that supports our growth objectives.\nAs previously discussed, we've been focused on driving SG&A efficiencies. We're pleased with our progress so far and have line of sight to at least an incremental $150 million in SG&A reductions over the next 18 months. This does not impact our growth strategy as we will continue to invest in initiatives that position us for the future. Later, Enrique will comment on the anticipated scope of our efforts and the likely timing.\nAt this time, I will now turn the call over to Jon to provide more detail on CarMax Auto Financing and our continuing focus on full credit spectrum expansion. Jon?\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated over $2 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 42.6% net of 3-day payoffs, which was 60 basis points above last year. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.2% versus 11.4% last quarter and reflects downward rate testing executed within the quarter.\nWhile CAF's full quarter increase in penetration appears modest, we believe the tariff pull forward in Q1 negatively impacted CAF share during the early part of the quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have made underwriting adjustments that translate to 100 to 200 basis points of growth, but the full realization of this growth can be impacted by noncontrollable factors such as customer credit mix and partner lender behavior. It is important to note that more than half of the impact from these adjustments comes from recaptured Tier 1 segments but with additional criteria overlay to reduce risk, while the remainder comes from within the top half of the Tier 2 space, which we have been testing over the past year.\nThird-party Tier 2 and Tier 3 penetration in the quarter combined for 23.8% of sales versus 24.4% last year as cash growth had an impact on partner volume.\nCAF income for the quarter was $103 million, down $13 million from FY '25. Net interest margin on the portfolio was 6.6%, up over 50 basis points from last year and relatively in line with last quarter. CAF's loan loss provision of $142 million results in a total reserve balance of $507 million for 3.02% of managed receivables exclusive of auto loans held for sale. Of the $142 million, $71 million is attributed to new originations within the quarter, while the remaining $71 million is an adjustment to the loss expectation of the existing portfolio. Also of note, as was seen in the first quarter, there was a reduction on the required provision stemming from $16 million in the reserve allocated to loans booked prior to Q2 now classified as held for sale.\nThe primary driver of the $71 million adjustment on the existing portfolio comes from additional losses anticipated within the 2022 and 2023 vintages. Recall, these customers have been the most impacted by the convergence of rapidly increasing vehicle prices and broader inflation. Despite the observed worsening, these vintages still remain highly profitable at an estimated lifetime profit of $1,500 per unit versus $1,800 contemplated at origination. Additionally, they continue to shrink in size and contribution to the overall portfolio as they are replaced with more recently originated Tier 1 receivables at significantly lower loss rates. Note that 2024 and 2025 post-contraction vintages continue to be right in line with our original loss expectations.\nRegarding the funding aspect of our full spectrum efforts, yesterday we closed our '25-B transaction, our second nonprime securitization of the year. This was upsized to $900 million in total notes and, for the first time, included the sale of most of the residual financial interest in the transaction to third-party investors, thus resulting in off-balance sheet treatment. We expect the gain on sale to be approximately $25 million to $30 million in third quarter income.\nWe also expect to receive approximately $40 million to $45 million in additional CAF income related to servicing fees and the retained beneficial interest over the life of the transaction. As a reminder, going forward, there will be no loss allowance or provision for this pool of loans.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.64 versus $0.85 a year ago. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and the CAF loss provision adjustment.\nTotal gross profit was $718 million, down 6% from last year's second quarter. Used retail margin of $443 million decreased by 8%, with lower volume and relatively stable per unit margins. Retail gross profit per used unit was $2,216, in line with historical average. Wholesale vehicle margin of $137 million decreased by less than 1% from a year ago, with lower volume partially offset by a slight increase in per unit margins. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $993.\nOther gross profit was $138 million, down 4% from a year ago. This was driven primarily by EPP, which decreased by $6 million driven by lower retail unit volume.\nService recorded a $4 million margin, reflecting a small improvement over last year's second quarter. Continued efficiency and cost coverage improvements were partially offset by the deleverage inherent in the lower year-over-year second quarter sales.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter were $601 million, down 2% from the prior year driven primarily by lower stock-based compensation. We continue to realize expense savings, but they were offset by cost pressures in the quarter. SG&A to gross profit deleveraged 350 basis points to 84% as lower volume more than offset lower costs.\nThe continued deployment of AI technology remains a key driver of efficiency gains and experience enhancements across our operations. For example, this quarter, Skye, our AI-powered virtual assistant continue to deliver year-over-year double-digit percent improvements in containment rate, customer experience consultants productivity and web and phone response rate SLAs. We recently fully rolled out Skye 2.0, which leverages agentic AI and expect this release will drive even more efficiency and experience improvements.\nAs Bill noted, we are committed to further reducing our SG&A by continuing to deliver efficiency gains across the business. The investments in technology, systems and processes that we have made as part of our omni transformation will allow us to substantially reduce spend through several key initiatives: modernizing and consolidating our technology infrastructure, automating manual processes, renegotiating and reducing third-party contracts and eliminating redundancies across the organization.\nThe goal of at least $150 million in SG&A reductions over the next 18 months represents a material improvement in our cost profile and reflects the execution on the plan that we have been developing with outside support. While we expect to realize some of these savings this fiscal year, we expect the vast majority will materialize in our exit rate by the end of fiscal 2027.\nIn addition to offsetting inflationary pressures, these ongoing savings will provide additional flexibility to reinvest in areas that directly drive sales, while also serving as a tailwind to our already robust earnings model of a high-teens EPS growth CAGR when retail unit growth is in the mid-single digits. We will continue to provide updates on this initiative during future earnings calls.\nLooking forward, I'll cover a few items. Regarding marketing, we expect an increase in per total unit spend in the back half of the year, particularly in the third quarter as we appropriately support our new brand positioning launch. We expect service margin to face pressure in the back half of the year due to seasonal sales volumes. For the full year, we still expect to deliver positive margin, which is a direct result of our efficiency improvements and cost coverage measures.\nTurning to capital allocation. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchases at an accelerated pace, buying back approximately 2.9 million shares for a total expenditure of $180 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.56 billion of our repurchase authorization remaining.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Enrique and Jon. Our customer-centric car buying and selling experience is a key differentiator in a very large and fragmented market and positions us well for the future. We are intently focused on driving this differentiated and best-in-class experience and doing so with greater efficiency.\nAs you heard from us today, we're actively executing on our key priorities, which include driving sales, advancing innovations to improve customer and associate experiences, bolstering our marketing efforts, increasing company-wide efficiencies and expanding CAF participation across the credit spectrum. All of these priorities will give us added flexibility and strengthen us for the future.\nWith that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Please go ahead.\n\nDavid L. Lowenstein\n\nAssistant Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Nicky. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2026 first quarter earnings conference call.

Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results highlight the strength of our earnings growth model, which is underpinned by our best-in-class omnichannel experience, diversity of our business and a sharp focus on execution.\nAcross the company, we are operating with a continuous improvement mindset. We are focused on growing sales and gaining market share, expanding gross profit, managing CAPs, credit spectrum expansion, leveraging SG&A and buying back shares. This focus, combined with our ability to provide a unique customer experience across our large total addressable market provides a long runway for profitable growth.\nIn the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis, we grew retail and wholesale unit volume, we delivered robust retail wholesale EPP and service GPUs. We bought more vehicles from both consumers and dealers achieving an all-time record with dealers. We grew CAF's net interest margin and continued to advance our full credit spectrum underwriting and funding model. We materially leveraged SG&A as a percent of gross profit. We doubled the pace of our share repurchases and we achieved 42% EPS growth.\nThis marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive retail unit comps and double-digit year-over-year earnings per share growth. During the period, we delivered total sales of $7.5 billion, up 6% compared to last year, reflecting higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. In our retail business, total unit sales increased 9% and used unit comps were up 8.1%. Average selling price was $26,100, a decrease of approximately $400 per unit year-over-year.\nFirst quarter retail gross profit per used unit was an all-time record, driven by strong demand and operating efficiencies across our logistics network and reconditioning operations. Wholesale unit sales were up 1.2% versus the first quarter last year. Average wholesale selling price declined approximately $150 per unit to $8,000. Wholesale gross profit per unit was historically strong and similar to last year. We bought approximately 336,000 vehicles during the quarter, up 7% from last year.\nWe purchased approximately 288,000 vehicles from consumers with more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our Edmunds sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 48,000 vehicles through dealers, which is up 38% from last year. Our digital capabilities supported 80% of our retail unit sales during the first quarter were omni and 14% were online.\nRelative to traditional and online-only dealers, we are the only nationwide retailer to offer an integrated, simple, seamless and personalized experience to meet the largest and growing segment of used car buyers. According to Cox Automotive Research as well as our own, the majority of customers shopping for used cars intend to transact via an omni experience. The combination of our associates, stores, technology and digital capabilities, all seamlessly tied together is a key differentiator that gives consumers the optionality to shop online, in-store or a combination of the two.\nOur Net Promoter Score is the highest it's been since rolling out our digital capabilities nationwide, supported by new record high online and omni scores, reflecting that this experience is resonating well with customers. Our differentiated offering gives us a unique opportunity to reach more customers. To further capitalize on this opportunity, we're excited to launch a new marketing campaign later in the summer that will bring our omnichannel experience and our digital capabilities to the forefront for a broad set of consumers.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Jon to provide more detail on CarMax Auto Finance. Jon?\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated over $2.3 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 41.8% net of 3-day payoffs, which was 150 basis points below last year. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.4%, in line with last year's first quarter. Cap's reduction in penetration was primarily driven by an influx of self-funded higher credit purchasers seen during the initial announcement of tariffs and, to a lesser degree, a higher Tier 3 penetration, both of which more than offset our expansion since Q4.\nThird-party Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was down 100 basis points year-over-year to 17.7% of sales while third-party Tier 3 volume accounted for 8% of sales, up from 7.5% last year. Cash income for the quarter was $142 million, which was down $5 million from FY '25. Net interest margin was 6.5%, up over 30 basis points from last year as customer APRs outpaced the increase in our funding cost. CAP's loan loss provision of $102 million was impacted by several notable items. First, Q1 is a seasonally higher sales and lower credit quality period requiring a larger provision for newly originated volume. Second, loss performance within the quarter, particularly within 2022 and 2023 vintages, along with the uncertain economic outlook necessitated additional loss reserves.\nNote that 2024 vintages remain largely in line with our original loss expectation. The last noteworthy item impacting the Q1 provision relates to CAPs continued build-out of our full spectrum lending capabilities. While we remain focused on increasing our penetration across the credit spectrum, we also want to carefully manage future risk from higher profit, higher loss receivables.\nTo that end, during the quarter, we earmarked a held for sale pool of loans with a $632 million principal balance from our nonprime portfolio. That loan pool is intended to be fully sold off our balance sheet as a part of a nonprime securitization transaction. In the immediate term, this treatment removes the requirements to reserve for future losses expected on this pool of receivables. In the period in which the ABS transaction closes, capital booked any gain realized by selling the financial interest in the loans.\nAlso, the risk of any financial impact from this pool due to future deterioration is removed once sold. This additional funding lever as well as other off-balance sheet funding vehicles under consideration will provide CarMax with significant flexibility and allow us to mitigate risk while focusing on our growth plan. Our loan loss provision of $102 million results in a total reserve balance of $474 million or 2.76% of managed receivables, exclusive of auto loans held for sale.\nNote, there was a reduction on this quarter's provision stemming from $26 million in the reserve allocated to loans booked prior to the first quarter now classified as held for sale. As we reflect on the bigger picture, CAF has delivered solid income for yet another quarter, and we see tremendous potential for the future.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, last quarter, we provided a view into the strength of the earnings model that we have built as part of our omni transformation. This model is designed to deliver an annual earnings per share CAGR in the high teens when retail unit growth is in the mid-single digits.\nFirst quarter results delivered net earnings per diluted share of $1.38, up 42% versus a year ago. Total gross profit was $894 million, up 13% from last year's first quarter. Used retail margin of $554 million increased by 12%. The with higher volume and per unit margins. Retail gross profit per used unit was $2.407, up $60 from a year ago and a record high. Wholesale vehicle margin of $157 million was flat from a year ago with an increase in volume, offset by a slight reduction in per unit margins.\nWholesale gross profit per unit was $147, which was historically strong, though down slightly from a year ago. Other gross profit was $183 million, up 31% from a year ago. This was driven primarily by a combination of EPP and service. EPP increased by $13 million or $9 per retail unit as we fully comped over margin increases taken in the prior year. Service recorded a $33 million margin, which was a $30 million improvement over last year's first quarter.\nWe achieved this performance improvement through cost coverage, volume-based leverage and efficiencies.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter were $660 million, up 3% or $21 million from the prior year. SG&A to gross profit leveraged by 680 basis points to 74% and driven by the growth in gross profit and our ongoing actions to improve expense efficiencies. SG&A dollars for the first quarter versus last year was mainly impacted by a compensation and benefits, the increase of $19 million. The majority of this increase was related to unit volume growth. We continue to deliver efficiency gains across the business.\nWe are off to a strong start in achieving our goal of omni cost neutrality in fiscal year '26 for the first time across 3 key metrics. In the first quarter, we were both more efficient versus pre omni and versus last year per used unit, per total unit and as a percent of gross profit. Recall that this compares to variable commission costs of selling and buying vehicles in our pre-omni model to our cost now. which includes a new per unit commission as well as the cost of running our customer experience centers.\nA key driver of these efficiency gains and experience enhancements has been our strategic deployment of AI technology across our operations. A few key metrics that illustrate the progress we are making year-over-year include Sky, our AI-powered virtual assistant realized a 30% improvement in containment rate. Our customer experience consultants productivity improved by 24%, and phone and web response rate SLAs improved by double digits.\nWe see tremendous opportunity to continue expanding AI applications across our business to drive both the top line growth and operational excellence.\nTurning to capital allocation. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value. Our priorities are clear: Invest in the core business, primarily through the reallocation of resources evaluate new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships or acquisitions and return excess capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we accelerated the pace of our share repurchases, buying back approximately 3 million shares for a total spend of $200 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.74 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.\nLooking forward to the balance of the year, I'll cover a few items. We expect service margin to grow year-over-year, predominantly in the first half of the year and to deliver a positive profit contribution for the full year as governed by sales performance, given the leverage -- deleverage nature of service. Recall that the first quarter is typically the strongest for service margins due to higher seasonal sales volumes.\nTurning to marketing. We expect for the full year that our spend on a total unit basis will be flat year-over-year. Regarding CAP's funding strategy, our current plan is to execute the programmatic off-balance sheet sale of the financial interest in the nonprime securitization once a year. As Jon noted, we will also be assessing additional off-balance sheet funding levers to further accelerate CAF penetration while continuing to learn from our full spectrum models.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Enrique and Jon. Before I open it up for questions, let me summarize what you heard from us today about our strong first quarter. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of retail positive retail unit comps and double-digit earnings per share growth. We grew both retail and wholesale unit volume.\nOur sourcing efforts hit another milestone with a record dealer volume through Max offer, and we continue to leverage our cost structure with meaningful SG&A improvement. Our digital capabilities and overall experiences are resonating with customers as evidenced by our Net Promoter Score. We're also continuing to leverage AI across the business to further enhance the experience for both customers and associates and to increase operational efficiency. We're taking the next steps in our credit expansion by delivering a new funding method for a portion of our nonprime portfolio that mitigates risk, gives us more flexibility and supports the growth of CAP income and we doubled our share repurchase pace.\nOur associates, stores, technology and digital capabilities, all seamlessly tied together, enable us to provide the most customer-centric car buying and selling experience. This is a key differentiator in a very large and fragmented market and positions us to continue to drive sales, gain market share and deliver significant year-over-year earnings growth for years to come.\nI want to thank our associates across the country for their dedication in delivering these results to providing an unmatched experience for our customers.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only 1 question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're very pleased with the continued positive trends across our diversified business during the third quarter with retail, wholesale and CAF all posting year-over-year gains. Our solid execution in a more stable environment for vehicle valuations enabled us to deliver robust EPS growth as we drove unit volume increases in sales and buys, maintain strong margins, stabilized the provision for loan losses and realized cost efficiencies.\nOur results reflect the strength of our business model, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Our best-in-class omnichannel experience is and will continue to be a key differentiator that gives us access to the largest total addressable market in the used car space and provides a strong runway for future growth.\nIn the third quarter, we grew retail and wholesale unit volume year-over-year. We delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs, expanded EPP gross profit and improved service gross profit year-over-year. We bought more vehicles from both consumers and dealers year-over-year, achieving a third quarter record with dealers. We grew CAP income year-over-year and continued to advance our full credit spectrum underwriting model. We materially levered SG&A as a percent of gross profit, and we achieved double-digit EPS growth.\nFor the third quarter of FY '25, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $6.2 billion, up 1% compared to last year, reflecting higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. In our retail business, total unit sales increased 5.4% and used unit comps were up 4.3%. Average selling price declined approximately $1,100 per unit or 4% year-over-year. Third quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,306 [indiscernible] to last year's $2,277.\nWholesale unit sales were up 6.3% versus the third quarter last year. Average selling price declined approximately $500 per unit or 6% year-over-year. Third quarter wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,015, up from $961 a year ago. We bought approximately 270,000 vehicles during the quarter, up 8% from last year. We purchased approximately 237,000 vehicles from consumers with more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant appraisal experience.\nWith the support of our Edmond sales teams, we sourced the remaining approximately 33,000 vehicles through dealers, which is up 47% from last year. We continue to see increased adoption of our omnichannel retail experience. For the third quarter, approximately 15% of retail unit sales were online, up from 14% last year. Approximately 56% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 55% in the prior year.\nTotal revenue from online transactions was approximately 32%, up from 31% last year. All of our third quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions, which represents 19% of total revenue for the quarter.\nCarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $160 million, up 8% from the same quarter last year. In a few minutes, John will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision, CAP contribution and our progress on full credit spectrum lending.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will share more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. The momentum that we have been building over the last several quarters carried into the third quarter as we delivered on all key financial fronts, positive retail unit comps growth in wholesale unit volumes, robust vehicle margins, material growth in other gross profit per retail unit growth in CAP income and strong flow-through to the bottom line.\nThird quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.81, up 56% versus a year ago. Total gross profit was $678 million, up 11% from last year's third quarter. Used retail margin of $425 million increased by 7% with higher volume and relatively flat per unit margins.\nWholesale vehicle margin of $138 million grew by 12% due to increases in both volume and unit margins. Other gross profit was $115 million, up 25% from a year ago. This was driven primarily by a combination of EPP and service. EPP increased by $15 million as we continue to benefit from higher MaxCare margins per contract. We expect margins per unit to be up slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, not by as much as we have experienced year-to-date as we will be lapping over the initial rollout of margin increases that took place in last year's fourth quarter.\nService margin improved by $10 million over last year's third quarter, recording an $11 million less. We achieved this performance improvement through successful cost coverage and efficiency measures and positive sales growth. We expect continued year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. as governed by sales performance, given the leverage, deleverage nature of service.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter were $576 million, up 3% or $16 million from prior year. SG&A leveraged by 640 basis points [ driven ] by the growth in gross profit and our continued expense efficiency actions.\nSG&A dollars in the third quarter versus last year were mainly impacted by 2 factors: First, total compensation and benefits increased by $28 million. This was primarily driven by our corporate bonus accrual, which had been reduced in the last year's third quarter; second, advertising was favorable by $9 million due to timing. [indiscernible] advertising, we expect our spend in the fourth quarter on a total unit basis will be higher than our year-to-date rate and last year's fourth quarter, which was $219 per total unit. This aligns with the previous guidance we have given on advertising and we expect full year spend to be approximately $200 on a total unit basis.\nI also want to point out 1 noteworthy item. As discussed last quarter, as part of our focus on efficiency, we have been evaluating our logistics operations. This quarter, we incurred a onetime charge of $5 million related to equipment and leasing arrangements that hit the other expense line. This is more than offset by efficiencies gained in our logistics operations.\nRegarding capital allocation. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for a total spend of $115 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.04 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $1.9 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 43.1% net of 3-day payoffs as compared to 44% during last year's third quarter. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points from a year ago. Third-party Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 17.9% and in line with a year ago, while third-party Tier 3 volume accounted for 6.5% of sales compared to the 6.9% seen in last year's third quarter.\nCAF income for the quarter was $160 million, which was up $11 million from the same period last year and was predominantly impacted by our net interest margin, which increased 35 basis points year-over-year to 6.2%. The provision for loan losses was $73 million versus last year's provision of $68 million, and results in a reserve balance of $479 million.\nWhile the $113 million provision for losses in the second quarter of this year was outsized and included a significant adjustment for the preexisting receivable base, this quarter's $73 million provision represents our belief that based on observed performance within the quarter, our adjustment in Q2 adequately accounted for future lifetime losses.\nThe $479 million reserve balance results in reserve to receivables ratio of 2.70% as compared to 2.82% at the end of Q2. This 12 basis point reduction is due to the combined effect of the more normalized provision within the quarter and the previous credit tightening still in place.\nAs a normal course of business, we are continuously exploring opportunities to help our customers through adjustments in our account servicing strategies. One such example is with payment extensions, which have historically impacted less than 1% of our portfolio in any given month and have been below industry levels. This tool has proven successful in helping customers navigate temporary challenges.\nDuring the quarter, we began testing an enhancement to our policy that further empowers delinquent customers to take advantage of a payment extension and more aligns with industry levels. While early performance results are encouraging and similar to those witnessed under the existing policy, we recognize that some customers will eventually return to delinquency and result in a charge-off. And for this, we have reserved accordingly.\nRegarding our full spectrum lending initiative, during Q3, we continued to test our new credit scoring models and corresponding strategies across the entirety of both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 spaces. And in November, we began initial testing of our new Tier 3 model.\nDuring the quarter, we also successfully executed our second higher prime ABS deal. In the next several quarters, we will remain disciplined in our testing plan, but we are excited for the significant growth opportunity that lies ahead for CAF.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon and Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of the call, I'm pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing across our business. The differentiated omnichannel capabilities we've built over the past few years have strengthened our business model and are key to our performance.\nWith these core capabilities in place, we are focused on refining the experience for associates and customers and are well positioned to leverage what we have built to support future top and bottom line growth across our diversified business.\nSome examples include: This quarter, we completed the nationwide rollout of our customer shopping accounts. As a reminder, these make it even easier for customers to see the steps they have taken on their shopping journey, whether on their own or with help from an associate. In addition, these accounts guide customers' next steps and create operational efficiencies by entiring associates to seamlessly search and update customer records regardless of where they originated.\nIn addition to the customer shopping accounts, tools such as Sky our AI-powered virtual assistants are creating operating efficiencies and providing help when consumers need it. Our data show that customers are completing more remote steps year-over-year, and this increase in remote steps is also improving conversion across all of our channels: online; in-store; and through our CECs.\nWe continue to add helpful shopping information tools to our website. For example, now we show vehicle-specific battery health information on most EVs. We also highlight tax credit eligible vehicles and allow customers to filter searches by cars that are eligible for the used EV tax credit. For supply, we've enhanced our industry-leading online appraisal experience. We are now able to give digital offers to approximately 99% of the customers who come to carmax.com for an appraisal. For finance, as John mentioned, we recently began testing our new Tier 3 origination model. We're now testing new credit scoring models and the corresponding strategies across the full credit spectrum, which positions us to further grow CAF income over time.\nAnd finally, we continue to focus on cost efficiencies. For example, we expanded our test of new transportation management process that leverages data science algorithms and AI to provide new planning and execution capabilities. The process essentially dispatches moves and automates communication between drivers and stores. We're pleased with the results and expect to see benefits to cost of goods sold over time.\nIn closing, we're excited about the future and our ability to grow sales and earnings. Our best-in-class omnichannel experience which is enabled by our great associates, physical footprint, technology and digital capabilities, all tied seamlessly together is a key differentiator that strengthens our competitive moat, and we believe will be increasingly important to win consumers going forward.\nWe're excited to be in a position to pivot from building capabilities to leveraging and enhancing them to drive growth, better execution, innovation efforts and experiences.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Todd?"

Welcome to the Q1 Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Lowenstein, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid L. Lowenstein\n\nAssistant Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Savannah. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance Operations.\nLet me remind you our statements today that are not statements of historical fact, including statements regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

[Operator Instructions] Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the quarter, we saw continued positive trends, including year-over-year price declines, improvement in vehicle value stability and ongoing growth in upper funnel demand. We're encouraged by what we are seeing and are continuing to strengthen our business by delivering associate and customer wins that are differentiated and durable.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs and grew EPP margins. We sourced approximately 35,000 vehicles from dealers an all-time record. We increased used saleable inventory units 5% year-over-year while decreasing used total inventory units 4%. We grew CAF income 7% year-over-year under [ tight ] lending standards. And post quarter end, we launched our first non-prime securitization deal.\nWe continue to actively manage our SG&A and we repurchased over $100 million in shares. For the first quarter of FY '25, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.1 billion, down 7% compared to last year, reflecting lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 3.1%, and average selling price declined approximately $700 per unit or 3% year-over-year. Used unit comps were down 3.8%, and we saw comp performance strengthen in the back half of the first quarter.\nFirst quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,347, in line with last year's of $2,361. Wholesale unit sales were down 8.3% versus the first quarter last year as the industry experienced lower seasonal appreciation year-over-year. Average selling price declined approximately $900 per unit or 10%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was a first quarter record of $10.64, up from 10.42 a year ago. We bought approximately 314,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 9% from last year.\nThe appreciation dynamics that I just mentioned impacted our overall buys as well. We purchased approximately 279,000 vehicles from consumers with slightly more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our Edmund sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 35,000 vehicles through dealers, up 70% from last year.\nFor our first quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online consistent with last year. We continue to see ongoing adoption of our omnichannel retail experience, approximately 57% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 54% in the prior year. Total revenue from online transactions was approximately 30%, in line with last year. All of our first quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions, which represent 18% of total revenue for the quarter.\nCarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $147 million, up 7% from the same period last year. In a few minutes, Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision, CAP contribution and our progress in becoming a full spectrum -- full credit spectrum lender, which enables incremental growth in finance income.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove strong per unit margins this quarter for both used and wholesale. We also delivered growth in other gross profit margins and cash contribution while staying focused on managing SG&A. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.97 versus $1.44 a year ago.\nAs a reminder, last year's quarter had a benefit of $59 million, which translates to a $0.28 per share from a legal settlement. Total gross profit was $792 million, down 3% from last year's first quarter. Used retail margin of $495 million declined by 4%, with lower volume and relatively flat per unit margins. Wholesale vehicle margin of $157 million declined by 6% with lower volumes, partially offset by higher per unit margins.\nOther gross profit was $139 million, up 3% from a year ago. This was driven by an $8 million increase in EPP. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of FY '24, we tested raising MaxCare margins per contract, which drove overall product profitability despite a lower product penetration rate. With that, we rolled out the margin increases in late Q4 FY '24. Service delivered $3 million in margin, flat with last year's first quarter. Performance was primarily supported by efficiency and cost coverage measures, offset by deleverage due to lower year-over-year sales in the quarter as well as by timing.\nWe expect year-over-year improvement for the balance of the year as governed by sales performance given the leverage, deleverage nature of service. On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter were $639 million, up 3% or $19 million. From the prior year's quarter, when excluding the benefit from the $59 million legal settlement received during the first quarter of FY '24. Also pressuring SG&A this quarter was approximately $22 million of expense from share-based compensation for certain retirement eligible executives and the lapping of favorable reserve adjustments related to non-CAF uncollectible receivables during last year's first quarter.\nExcluding these items, which we noted in our FY '24 year-end call, SG&A total dollars were down year-over-year in the first quarter due to our continued discipline in spend levels. SG&A dollars for the first quarter were mainly impacted by 2 additional factors. First, other overhead increased by $6 million when excluding last year's favorable legal settlement. Continued year-over-year favorability in non-GAAP uncollectible receivables was more than offset by lapping over last year's first quarter favorable reserve adjustment.\nSecond, total compensation and benefits, excluding share-based compensation expense, decreased by $3 million, mostly driven by our ongoing focus on efficiency in stores and CECs. Regarding capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total spend of $104 million, which was an acceleration in the pace from the repurchase levels in the second half of fiscal year '24. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.3 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.\nIn the first quarter, we also paid off our $300 million floating rate term loan, which was scheduled to mature in early June.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $2.3 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 43.3% net of 3-day payoffs, which was up 60 basis points from last year's first quarter. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.4%, an increase of 30 basis points from a year ago. Partner Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.7%, down from 20.4% observed last year. Partner Tier 3 volume accounted for 7.5% of sales, up from 6.7% compared to last year, as our partners improved offers were in place for the entirety of the first quarter.\nBoth tiers saw less application volume year-over-year as lower credit customers remain challenged with affordability. Also impacting each of these year-over-year results, but to a lesser degree, is CAF's continued decreased volume in Tier 3 as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2. CAF income for the quarter was $147 million, up $10 million from the same period last year, primarily driven by an increase in total interest margin. Note, fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $3 million in expense this quarter versus $9 million in expense during last year's first quarter.\nThe net interest margin percentage for the quarter was 6.2%, up from last quarter, but in line with our expected level of near 6%. The provision for loan losses was flat to last year at $81 million and resulted in a reserve balance of $493 million or 2.79% of receivables compared to 2.78% at the end of last quarter. CAF's continued investment in the Tier 2 space, offset by the previously implemented tightening in Tier 1, contributed to a consistent reserve to receivable ratio.\nAs was highlighted last quarter, CAF has been building the capability and infrastructure to scale its participation across all credit tiers. First, CAF has leveraged its learning in Tier 2, along with its experience operating in both Tiers 1 and 3 to develop a new full-spectrum underwriting model, which we will begin to test in the second quarter. From a funding perspective, we plan to expand our current asset-backed securitization program from a single platform to one that more broadly incorporates caps receivables across distinct prime and nonprime segments.\nWe believe this will allow us to better align our offering with each investor base and ultimately generate added funding capacity. To that end, our first non-prime ABS transaction is currently in the market with $625 million of offered notes. Having the ability to both successfully decision and efficiently fund the entirety of the credit spectrum at scale puts CAF in a strategic position to further complement our full roster of lending partners while also driving additional finance income for the business.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you. As I mentioned earlier, we are encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing in pricing and vehicle value stability. I am proud of the durable actions we have been taking to support our business and further differentiate our offering, which are setting us up for continued improvements in our performance and future growth. Some examples include: We've expanded our vehicle sourcing capabilities by attracting more dealers to MaxOffer through product enhancements that make it even easier to use. We achieved record sourcing volume each month of the quarter and are excited about launching this capability in New York during the second quarter.\nWe've increased used saleable inventory units while lowering total used inventory units through with reductions from new title management capabilities and focused inventory management in nonproduction stores. We have enhanced CAF ability to become a full spectrum lender, which positions us to further grow CAF income over time. We've raised our EPP margins and improved service gross profit. We have achieved efficiency gains in our stores and CECs that will scale very well as we buy and sell more cars. We have launched a number of EV research tools through Edmund to help educate and build trust with consumers.\nWe've also established test stores in California to evaluate new capabilities that support our operational readiness for increased EV sales and also enhance the customer experience. Finally, we have continued to further enhance our omnichannel capabilities we are rolling out our new order processing system to our stores and plan for it to be available nationwide later this year.\nThe system helps associates guide customers through each step of the buying journey and provides a more seamless experience for consumers who prefer to blend self-progression with assistance from associates. In addition to these actions, we are focused on driving down cost of goods sold by pursuing incremental efficiency opportunities that we've identified across our logistics network and reconditioning operations.\nFor logistics, we're testing a transportation management system that dispatches moves through a centralized team. The system automates communication between drivers and stores and provides new planning and execution capabilities. For reconditioning, we've identified opportunities to reduce costs such as parts acquisition, bringing elements of sublet work in-house and optimizing production workflow.\nIn addition, we believe that balancing production capacity across our stores and stand-alone reconditioning centers will drive further efficiencies and potentially enable us to take on more MaxCare work over time. All of these actions continue to make a stronger, better position to support consumers and fuel our excitement about our future growth in sales and profitability.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Savanna?"

[Operator Instructions] Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're encouraged by the performance of our business during the fourth quarter. We are continuing to leverage our strongest assets, our associates, capabilities, experience and culture to build momentum as we manage through the cycle.\nWhile affordability of used cars remains a challenge for consumers, pricing improved during the quarter. We continue to achieve efficiency improvements in our core operations and believe we are well positioned to drive growth as the market turns.\nIn the fourth quarter, we posted our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential year-over-year retail used unit improvement and reported growth in total used unit sales and comps. We delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs. We increased used salable inventory units more than 10% while holding used total inventory units flat year-over-year.\nWe continue to actively manage our SG&A, and we grew CAF income significantly as we delivered a substantial reduction in the provision for loan losses year-over-year while maintaining stable net interest margin sequentially.\nFor the fourth quarter of FY '24, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $5.6 billion, down 2% compared to last year. This was driven by lower retail and wholesale prices and lower wholesale volume, partially offset by higher retail volume.\nIn our retail business, total unit sales increased 1.3%, and used unit comps were up 0.1%. Average selling price declined approximately $600 per unit or 2% year-over-year. Our market share data indicates that our nationwide share of 0- to 10-year-old used vehicles declined from 4% in calendar '22 to 3.7% in 2023 as we prioritize profitability over near-term market share growth. As always, we continue to test price elasticity to validate our decisions.\nExternal title data shows that our market share initially accelerated relative to our performance across the second half of 2022 but then came under pressure during multiple periods of steep depreciation. We remain confident in our ability to accelerate market share growth as used vehicle affordability continues to improve and as the volatility of vehicle value stabilizes.\nFourth quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,251, relatively consistent with last year's fourth quarter record of $2,277. Wholesale unit sales were down 4% versus the fourth quarter last year. Average selling prices declined approximately $250 per unit or 3% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,120, slightly down from $1,187 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter wholesale GPU was within $4 of our all-time record benefited from appreciation and strong dealer demand, particularly at the end of last year's quarter. This prior year appreciation dynamic impacted our year-over-year performance in [indiscernible] as well.\nWe bought approximately 234,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 11% from last year. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately 213,000 from consumers with slightly more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant [indiscernible] experience.\nWith the support of our Edmond sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 21,000 vehicles through dealers, up 45% from last year. For our fourth quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, consistent with last year. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 52% in the prior year. All of our fourth quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions. This represents 17% of total revenue.\nTotal revenue from online transactions was approximately 30%, in line with last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $147 million, up 19% from $124 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on consumer financing, the loan loss provisions and CAF contribution in a few minutes.\nBut at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove another quarter of sequential improvement in our used unit sales with strong per unit margins for both used and wholesale and strong CAF contribution growth while staying focused on managing SG&A.\nFourth quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.32 versus $0.44 a year ago. Last year's quarter benefited from an $0.08 tailwind due to the receipt of extended protection plan or EPP profit-sharing revenues as well as $0.04 from a lower tax rate compared to a more normalized tax rate this quarter.\nTotal gross profit was $586 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Used retail margin of $387 million was flat with higher volume partially offset by a slightly lower per unit margin.\nWholesale vehicle margin decreased by 9% to $129 million with a decrease in volume and per unit margin compared to last year. Other gross profit was $69 million, down 15% from a year ago. This decrease was driven primarily by last year's receipt of $16 million in profit sharing revenues from our EPP partners. As noted on our third quarter call, we did not expect to receive profit-sharing revenues this year as our partners experienced inflationary pressures and consumers return to more normalized driving patterns. Partially offsetting this dynamic was positive impact from price elasticity testing on our extended service product.\nDuring the quarter, we tested raising MaxCare margins per contract sold, which resulted in a slight decrease in product penetration while driving overall profitability. We are encouraged by these results, and we have rolled out the margin increase nationally. Our expectation is that this action will drive approximately $20 per retail unit of incremental EPP margin in FY '25.\nService decreased by $4 million as compared to last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by wage pressures and planned lower production in the quarter as we pre-built inventory in the third quarter due to holiday timing.\nFor the full year, service improved by $75 million year-over-year. Our expectation is that we will continue to see significant year-over-year favorability in FY '25. The extent of this improvement will be governed by sales performance, given the leverage/deleverage nature of service.\nThird-party finance fees were down $3 million from a year ago driven by higher volume in Tier 3 for which we pay a fee and lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the fourth quarter were $581 million, up 1% from the prior year's quarter. Our continued discipline in spend and investment levels allowed us to come in flat year-over-year when excluding share-based compensation. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we passed the year mark since initiating our significant cost management efforts.\nSG&A dollars for the fourth quarter versus last year were mainly impacted by 3 factors. First, other overhead decreased by $16 million. This decrease was driven primarily from reductions in spend for our technology platforms and from the continued favorability in noncap uncollectible receivables.\nSecond, total compensation and benefits increased by $7 million, excluding an $8 million increase in share-based compensation. This increase was mostly driven by a higher corporate bonus accrual in the quarter.\nThird, advertising increased by $5 million. This reflects an increase as communicated last quarter due primarily to the timing of per unit spend.\nFor full year FY '24, we strongly outperformed the target we set out at the beginning of the year of requiring low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A even when excluding the benefits from this year's legal settlements. Our ability to materially drive SG&A costs down year-over-year was led by favorability in noncap uncollectible receivables that reflects improved execution at our stores, at our corporate offices and by external partners, our focus on driving efficiency gains in our stores and CECs, the planned reduction of technology spend and by aligning staffing levels and marketing spend to sales.\nIn FY '25, we expect to acquire low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A when excluding FY '24's favorable legal settlements. This reinforces our pathway back to a lower SG&A leverage ratio with our initial goal of returning to the mid-70% range over time once we see healthier consumer demand.\nWe anticipate that SG&A will be pressured in the first quarter. As a reminder, we received $59 million in a legal settlement during the first quarter of FY '24.\nAdditionally, in this year's first quarter, we expect an approximately $25 million impact due to share-based compensation for certain retirement-eligible executives and the lapping of favorable reserve adjustments related to non-GAAP uncollectible receivables during last year's first quarter.\nWith regard to marketing, going forward, we plan to speak to our spend on a per total unit basis, inclusive of total retail and wholesale units. We believe this more holistically reflects the impact of our marketing initiatives, which support both vehicle sales and buys. In FY '25, we expect full year marketing spend on a total unit basis to be similar to FY '24 at approximately $200.\nRegarding capital structure. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 686,000 shares for a total spend of $49 million. Starting in the first quarter, we intend to modestly accelerate the pace of our share repurchases above the pace that we implemented in our third quarter of fiscal year '24. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.36 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.\nFor capital expenditures, we anticipate an investment level between $500 million to $550 million, up from the $465 million in FY '24. The year-over-year increase in planned spending is primarily related to the timing of spend for new stores.\nLike in FY '24, the largest portion of our CapEx investment remains related to the land and the build-out of facilities for long-term growth capacity and offsite reconditioning and auctions.\nIn FY '25, we plan to open 5 new store locations. Consistent with our strategy, these new locations will be smaller, cross-functional stores that complement our omnichannel strategy and leverage our scale. We also plan to open our second standalone reconditioning facility, which will be located in Richland, Mississippi as well as one off-site auction location in the Los Angeles metro market.\nWe currently expect to open multiple off-site reconditioning and auction locations in FY '26. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the fourth quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $1.8 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 42.3% net of 3-day payoffs, which was down 240 basis points from the same period last year. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers grew to 11.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from the last year's fourth quarter and 20 basis points sequentially.\nTier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.7%, down from 19.4% observed during last year's fourth quarter. Tier 3 accounted for 8.2% sales, up 130 basis points from last year as a partner began to ease previously implemented tightening.\nAlso impacting each of these year results was CAF's continued decreased percentage in Tier 3 as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2. CAF income for the quarter was $147 million, up $23 million from the same period last year. This improvement was primarily driven by a $26 million year-over-year reduction in the provision for loan losses, slightly offset by a $3 million reduction in total interest margin.\nNote, fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $4 million in expense this quarter versus $1 million of income in last year's fourth quarter. The $72 million provision within the quarter resulted in a reserve balance of $483 million or 2.78% of receivables compared to 2.92% at the end of the third quarter. This highlights the significant impact that originations under our tightened credit policy are having on the reserve as they continue to become a larger percentage of the full portfolio.\nIn addition, observed performance within the portfolio aligned closely to our reserve expectations at the end of the third quarter and contributed to the reduction in the reserve. The margin to receivable rate of the portfolio remained steady at 5.9% for the quarter.\nWe remain pleased with our ability to maintain a stable interest margin despite keeping our credit tightening in place. As I noted earlier, CAF continues to test across varying parts of the credit spectrum. Ultimately, CAF is building the capability to scale its participation across all credit tiers, which will help to capture finance economics, drive sales and fully complement our valued lending partnerships that are a key foundation of CarMax's best-in-class credit platform.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon and Enrique. Fiscal 2024 was a challenging year across the used car industry as vehicle affordability and widespread macro factors continue to pressure sales. In response, we focused on what we can control and took deliberate steps to support our business, both the near term and long run.\nIn addition to achieving the efficiencies across our entire organization that Enrique talked about , I am proud of the progress we've made in further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities as we prioritize projects designed to optimize experiences for our associates and customers and drive operating efficiencies.\nSome examples include: for retail, we leverage data science, automation and AI to make it even easier for customers to complete key transaction steps like vehicle transfers on their own. We also enhanced digital checkout functionality for appraisal customers, enabling them to submit their documents remotely and unlocking their ability to participate in our 30-minute express drop-off experience.\nAdditionally, we expanded capabilities for Sky, our 24/7 virtual assistant to include managing finance applications, vehicle transfers, appointment reservations and appraisal offers. Customer adoption of Sky has been strong. And this has not only created efficiencies, but also widened bandwidth for our associates.\nFor wholesale and vehicle acquisition, we modernized our auction platform to offer new services, including single sign-on across all of our systems, AI-enhanced condition reports, early bidding capabilities and automated bills of sale. Additionally, we streamlined max offer by rolling out our instant offer experience to all participating dealers.\nIn the credit space, we have now incorporated all of our lenders into our finance-based shopping platform, expanding the breadth and depth of offers available to our customers. We continue to see great adoption with more than 80% of the consumers utilizing this best-in-class prequalification product as they begin the credit process.\nFinally, Edmunds launched a number of research by tools in support of its goal to be the leader in EV research. These include range tests, charging efficiencies, vin-level battery health assessments, EV tax credit and incentive guides.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, we will build on our progress from last year to further expand our competitive moat. We are confident that the actions we are taking will enable us to grow sales, profitable market share and buys while also driving additional operational efficiencies as the market turns.\nSome examples include: for retail, we plan to launch an evolved hub within our customers' online shopping accounts that will make it even easier to seamlessly go back and forth between assisted health and self-progression. Customers will be able to see the steps they have taken on their shopping journey, whether on their own or with help from a CEC or store associate.\nThe hub will also guide next steps and promote MaxCare, our extended service plan offering. Additionally, we will continue to digitize work in support of our focus to build a leaner and high-value assistance model for our CECs. This will enable existing resources to support higher transaction volume as we grow traffic and drive stronger conversion.\nAs part of this effort, we will further integrate Sky into key communication channels, improve its ability to serve as the initial point of contact across many points in the customer shopping journey. Sky will manage next steps on -- or seamlessly transition customers to a CEC associate via the customer's channel of sorts.\nOur vehicle acquisition will focus to bring even more vehicles into our ecosystem. A key component of this will be our continued partnership with Edmunds to acquire vehicles from dealers.\nIn the credit space, we plan to further optimize our prequalification product by integrating the customers' instant offer into the application process. As Jon mentioned, we will also continue to [indiscernible] participation across varying parts of the credit spectrum. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities that enable us to provide outstanding offers for consumers while driving sales and economics for the business.\nIn regard to our long-term financial targets, we're maintaining our goal to sell more than 2 million combined retail and wholesale units annually. However, we are extending the time frame for this goal between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2030 due to the uncertainty and the timing of the market recovery and as we continue to focus on profitable market share growth. We will adjust the time frame as we gain greater visibility into the industry's pace recovery.\nGiven higher average selling prices, we expect to achieve the $33 billion annual revenue target sooner than units. And similarly, we also expect to achieve more than 5% nationwide market share of 0- to 10-year-old used vehicle sooner than units. Given the recent volatility in vehicle values, we will provide an updated time frame for our expected achievement at the end of fiscal year 2025.\nBefore turning to Q&A, I want to recognize 2 significant milestones. First, CarMax celebrated its 30th anniversary during fiscal 2024. I want to thank and congratulate all of our associates for the work they do. They are the differentiator and the key to our success.\nSecond, Fortune Magazine recently named CarMax as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For, for the 20th year in a row. I'm incredibly proud of this recognition, particularly as we faced a challenging year. It's due to our associates' commitment to supporting each other, our customers and our communities every day.\nIn closing, I'm proud of the progress we've made on our journey to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry. I'm encouraged by the sequentially quarterly improvements we're driving across our business, and I'm excited about our focuses for fiscal 2025. And our core operations are strong, and we are well positioned to drive growth as macro conditions improve.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So Shelby?"

Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of our strategy that has yielded sequential year-over-year improvements across key components of our business for four straight quarters. While affordability of used car remains a challenge for consumers, we're excited about the positive impact we are seeing from our omnichannel investments, which reinforces our strong belief that we are well positioned for the future. This quarter, we delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs. We bought more vehicles from consumers and dealers, and we also sold more wholesale units than a year ago. We further reduced SG&A from the prior year. We continued to strengthen the credit mix within NCAP's receivables portfolio, which had a positive impact on our loan loss provision, and we resumed our share repurchase program.\nFor the third quarter of FY '24, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $6.1 billion, down 5% compared to last year. This was driven by lower retail and wholesale prices and lower retail volume partially offset by higher wholesale volume. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 2.9% and used unit comps were down 4.1%. Average selling price declined approximately $1,300 per unit or 5% year-over-year. Third quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,277, relatively consistent with $2,237 from last year. For the fourth quarter, our expectation is that our margin -- our per unit margin will be lower than last year's fourth quarter record margin. We continue to expect that per unit margin for the full year will be similar to last year. As always, we will continue to actively manage this as we test price elasticity and monitor the competitive landscape. Wholesale unit sales were up 7.7% versus the third quarter last year. Average selling price declined approximately $600 per unit or 7% year-over-year. Third quarter wholesale gross profit per unit was $961 in line with $966 a year ago. Like our outlook on retail GPU, we anticipate wholesale per unit margin for the full year will be similar to last year. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter wholesale GPU was within $4 of our all-time record and benefited from appreciation and strong dealer demand, particularly at the end of the quarter. We expect this year's fourth quarter per unit margin will be more in line with our year-to-date performance and lower than last year.\nWe bought approximately 250,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter, up 5% from last year. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately $228,000 from consumers with slightly more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. As a result, our self-sufficiency remained above 70% for the quarter. With the support of our Edmond sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 22,000 vehicles through dealers, up from approximately 14,000 last year. In regard to our third quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 12% last year. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter up from 52% in the prior year.\nAll of our third quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions. This represents 19% of total revenue. Total revenue from online transactions was approximately 31%, up from 28% last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $149 million down slightly from $152 million during the same period last year. John will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contribution in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year performance across our business and our P&L. Notable areas of improvement included used in wholesale unit sales and their respective margin dollars, total gross profit, CAF contribution, SG&A leverage and EPS. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.52 versus $0.24 a year ago. Total gross profit was $613 million, up 6% from last year's third quarter. Used retail margin declined by 1% to $398 million with lower volume, partially offset by a slightly higher per unit margin. Wholesale vehicle margin increased by 7% to $123 million, with an increase in volume and flat per unit margin compared to last year. Other gross profit was $92 million, up 55% from a year ago. This increase was driven by service, which delivered a $33 million improvement over last year. with this year's quarter reporting a $21 million loss.\nThe efficiency and cost coverage measures that we put in place towards the end of FY '23 continued to drive improved year-over-year performance in FY '24. Extended protection plan or EPP revenues were relatively flat compared to last year's third quarter. We do not expect to receive profit-sharing revenues in the fourth quarter due to the inflationary pressures our partners have experienced. Third-party finance fees were down $2 million from a year ago, driven by lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee and higher volume in Tier 3 for which we pay a fee. On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter were $560 million, down 5% from the prior year's quarter as we continue to see benefits from our cost management efforts. SG&A as a percent of gross profit levered by 11 percentage points as compared to last year. The decrease in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to 3 factors: first, Other overhead decreased by $19 million. This decrease was driven primarily by continued favorability in non-GAAP uncollectible receivables and, to a lesser degree, from reductions in spend for our technology platforms and from favorability in costs associated with lower staffing levels. Second, Total compensation and benefits decreased by $20 million, excluding a $3 million increase in share-based compensation. This decrease was primarily driven by our continued focus on driving efficiency gains and aligning staffing levels in stores and CECs with sales. The decrease was also impacted by a lower corporate bonus accrual in the quarter. Third, advertising increased by $5 million. This reflects an increase in per unit spend as compared to last year's quarterly low level of per unit spend and was partially offset by lower units.\nAs we have previously communicated, our expectation is for our full year marketing spend on a per unit basis to be similar to last year. Accordingly, we expect that our per unit spend in this year's fourth quarter will exceed last year's fourth quarter. Entering the fourth quarter, we have now passed the year mark since we initiated our significant cost management efforts. We are well on track to outperform the target we set out at the beginning of the year of requiring low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A for the full year, even when excluding the benefits from this year's legal settlements. That being said, we remain disciplined with our spend and investment levels.\nRegarding capital structure, we resumed our share repurchase program in October. Repurchasing approximately 649,000 shares for a total spend of $42 million in the quarter. This pace is in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.41 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. In terms of other uses of capital, such as new store openings, we will open four stores in the fourth quarter. Including two 2 in the New York metro market and one in each of the Los Angeles and Chicago metro markets. We will also open our first stand-alone reconditioning center in the Atlanta metro market. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $2 billion, resulting in penetration of 44% net of 3-day payoffs, which was up from Q2 and relatively in line with the 44.4% observed during the third quarter last year. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.3%, an increase of 150 basis points from the same period last year and up 20 basis points from Q2. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was sequentially in line with Q2 at 18%, but remains lower year-over-year as we have yet to fully comp over the partner tightening observed in the back half of calendar 2022. Tier 3 accounted for 6.9% of sales as compared to 6.1% last year. Impacting each of these results as CAF's decreased percentage in Tier 3 as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2.\nCAF income for the quarter was $149 million, down $3.5 million from the same period last year, but up $14 million sequentially. The provision for the quarter was $68.3 million as compared to $85.7 million in the prior year's Q3. The $17 million favorability was offset by a year-over-year reduction in total interest margin of $20 million, driven by additional interest expense of $81 million. Note fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $6 million in expense this year versus $5 million of income last year. The total interest margin of the portfolio decreased to 5.9% from the 6.1% seen last quarter. This slight reduction is primarily a result of increased funding costs, including the fair market value adjustments along with CAF's deliberate credit tightening that began last year, which inherently removes higher margin, higher loss assets from new originations. CAF continued to offset these headwinds by adjusting customer rates but with a careful eye on 3-day payoffs, sales and overall CarMax profitability.\nWe are pleased with our ability to maintain a relatively stable net interest margin despite the volatile interest rate environment. The $68 million provision within the quarter resulted in a reserve balance of $512 million or 2.92% of receivables compared to 3.08% at the end of the second quarter. This 16 basis point reduction has occurred even with CAP's continued investment in the Tier 2 space and is evidence of the growing impact that our broader credit tightening is having on the overall portfolio. While cap delinquency levels remain elevated versus historic norms, as has been the case industry-wide, we believe our reserve adjustment adequately reflects the anticipated future loss performance of our portfolio. The underwriting adjustments executed to date have been the right strategic moves to ensure we hit targeted loss levels, preserve our access to efficient funding yet still deliver strong future cap earnings. We are well poised to recapture Tier 1 and Tier 3 volume as economic conditions improve and our continued learning in the Tier 2 space should provide a future growth opportunity. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, John and Enrique. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're excited about the contributions we are seeing from our omnichannel investments. Our omnichannel capabilities offer our customers a uniquely personalized car buying experience that enables them to do as much or as little online and in-stores they want. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on our journey to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry. As we have said before, we believe consumers in the used car industry will increasingly prefer to have the ability to progress digitally. We are seeing this in our data. At the end of fiscal year '20 when we completed our initial omnichannel rollout, approximately 40% of our customers leverage some or all of our digital capabilities to complete their transactions. That has grown to approximately 70% this year. I recognize that the market volatility over the past few years has made it challenging to see the direct benefits omnichannel has delivered to our business, so I want to share some proof points that we are seeing. First, our data indicates that omnichannel is driving incremental retail customers to CarMax. Customers who fully complete an online transaction are 10% more likely to be new to CarMax compared with our omnichannel and in-store customers. We have also found that our online consumers skew younger, which creates the opportunity to participate in more of their lifetime purchase cycles. Additionally, since initially completing our omnichannel rollout, we have seen outsized market share growth in our oldest 15 markets where we have not opened new stores since calendar 2013. In calendar 2019, the market share annual growth rate for these markets doubled from the average annual growth rate for the previous 5 years. Moreover, from the beginning of calendar 2019 to the end of calendar '22, the market share average annual growth rate for these older markets continue to exceed their pre omnichannel average growth rate.\nSecond, instant offer, our online consumer-facing appraisal tool that is a core part of our omnichannel capabilities is significantly driving our vehicle purchases and wholesale sales. We doubled our bots from consumers of the year we launched Instant Offer. This enabled us to grow our self-sufficiency to over 70%, which we have maintained since we launched the tool. Online buyouts have also fueled our wholesale volume, which grew approximately 65% during the launch year and has remained well above the volume prior to Instant Offer. It's worth noting that our instant offer algorithms also support our dealer-facing Max offer vehicle sourcing application.\nThird, our omnichannel products are supporting double-digit web traffic growth. Finance based shopping has been our #1 lead source. This multi-lender prequalification products gives customers the ability to digitally receive quick credit decisions across our inventory with no impact to their credit score. Over 80% of our customers are using this online tool as they begin the credit process.\nFinally, omnichannel is on track to be a more efficient cost structure compared to our store-only model. Our omnichannel cost structure has more fixed costs than our historical store-only structure. We continue to show sequential year-over-year improvements in key cost efficiency metrics for omnichannel overhead model. With a more fixed cost structure, we expect to lever more strongly than in the previous model as demand picks up. We expect the impact of our omnichannel capabilities will continue to grow over time as consumers demand a more personalized experience that combines online and in-store progression. We believe that many of our competitors across the used car industry will not be able to deliver this experience in a simple and seamless manner.\nIn closing, we're confident we have the right strategy in place. our consistent approach to control what we can and deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry is driving sequential quarterly improvements across our business. We are well positioned to emerge from this cycle an even stronger company. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Although our second quarter results largely reflect the same widespread pressures that we cited over the past year, we continued to see sequential quarterly improvement across our business. We believe the deliberate steps we are taking to control what we can are supporting our business now while also positioning us well for the future. This quarter, we delivered strong retail GPU. We further reduced SG&A year-over-year. We maintained use sellable inventory units at a similar level to the first quarter, while total inventory dollars decreased by 18% year-over-year, split approximately evenly between lower units and reduced acquisition costs.\nWe drove strong wholesale GPU despite experiencing steep depreciation and we stabilized CAF's net interest margin while we maintain penetration. For the second quarter of FY '24 our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.1 billion, down 13% compared to last year, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, while total unit sales declined 7.4% and used unit comps were down 9%, we continue to achieve sequential quarterly improvement.\nFurther, comp sales improved sequentially by month across the second quarter. Average selling price declined approximately $1,200 per unit or 4% year-over-year. Retail gross profit per used unit was $2,251 similar to last year's second quarter record high of $2282. We continue to expect this year's full year per unit margin will be similar to last year. As always, we will continue to test price elasticity and monitor the competitive landscape.\nWholesale unit sales were down 11.2% versus the second quarter last year. Like used unit sales [indiscernible] sequential improvement year-over-year from the second half of last year and this year's first quarter. Average selling price declined approximately $1,300 per unit or 12% year-over-year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $963 up from $881 a year ago, we achieved this despite experiencing steep depreciation that was concentrated primarily in June and July. We bought approximately 292,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter, down 15% from last year as we adjusted offers to reflect the steep depreciation that we are seeing in the marketplace. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately 273,000 from consumers in the quarter, with a little more than half of those buyers coming through our online instant appraisal experience.\nAs a result, our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. Supported by our Edmunds Sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 19,000 vehicles through dealers, down 5% from last year. In regard to our second quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online up from 11% last year. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 53% in the prior year.\nNearly all of our second quarter wholesale auctions in sales, which represents 19% of total revenue, remain virtual and are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%, up slightly from 30% last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $135 million, down from $183 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contributions in a few minutes. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year performance across key financial metrics, including unit sales, for sale margin, gross profit, SG&A and EPS. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.75 versus $0.79 a year ago. Total gross profit was $697 million, down 5% from last year's second quarter. Used retail margin declined by 9% to $452 million, driven by lower volume at similar per unit margins. Wholesale vehicle margin declined by 3% to $137 million with a decrease in volume, partially offset by stronger per unit margin performance.\nOther gross profit was $108 million, up 6% from last year's second quarter. This increase was driven by service which delivered a $20 million improvement over last year, with this quarter, this year's quarter reporting a $14 million loss. As we communicated in our last 2 earnings calls, our expectation is that service will deliver improved year-over-year performance for FY '24 as a result of the efficiency and cost coverage measures that we've put in place.\nThe extent of the improvement will also depend on sales performance given the leverage, deleverage nature of service. The improvement in service was partially offset by a reduction in extended protection plan for EPP revenues and third-party finance fees. EPP revenues were down $8 million, primarily due to lower sales and were, to a lesser degree, impacted by slightly lower penetration rates partially due to recent pricing increases taken to offset cost pressures experienced by our third-party providers. These items were partially offset by favorability in year-over-year reserve adjustments. Third-party finance fees were down $4 million from last year's second quarter, driven by lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter were $586 million, down 12% from the prior year's quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our cost management efforts. To a lesser degree, we also had some timing favorability in the quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 84%, a leverage of 6.3 points as compared to last year's second quarter. The decrease in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following: First, other overhead decreased by $41 million. This decrease was driven by several factors, including continued favorability in non-GAAP uncollectible receivables, favorability in costs associated with lower staffing levels and from reductions in spend for our technology platforms and strategic initiatives, which included a timing benefit this quarter.\nWe also had 2 smaller items in the quarter that largely offset each other. These consisted of additional settlement dollars from the same class action lawsuit we spoke to in the first quarter, offset by unfavorable self-insured losses related to multiple hail storm events. Second, total compensation and benefits decreased $28 million, excluding a $7 million increase in share-based compensation. This decrease was primarily driven by our continued focus on driving efficiency gains and aligning staffing levels in stores and CECs to sales.\nThird, we reduced advertising by $17 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in per unit spend as compared to last year's peak per unit spend, lower volume and timing. As we communicated on our fourth quarter call, as we enter the back half of FY '24, we will have largely [ anniversaried ] over the year-over-year benefits from our cost management efforts.\nWith that said, we remain disciplined with our spend. We also expect timing and marketing and technology spend to impact the back half of FY '24. In regard to marketing, we still expect our full year spend on a per unit basis to be similar to FY '23 spend level. Accordingly, our spend in the back half of FY '24 will exceed the per unit spend from the front half. Regarding technology spend, approximately $10 million of the year-to-date year-over-year favorability experienced in other overhead will hit the back half of FY '24.\nWe remain committed to effectively managing our cost structure. Our performance in the first half of the year has us on track to deliver on our goal of low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A for the full year. Even when excluding the benefits from this year's legal settlement. Regarding capital structure, while we paused the repurchase of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we intend to restart our share repurchase program this quarter. We expect a modest initial pace that will be below the average quarterly pace prior to our pause.\nOur objective is to appropriately manage our net leverage to maintain financial flexibility and to efficiently access capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole, while also returning capital back to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.45 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated $2.2 billion, resulting in penetration of 42.8% net of 3-day payoffs, which was consistent with Q1 and up from 41.2% observed during the second quarter last year. Within the quarter, CAF tightened further within Tier 3 and is retaining only a modest amount of volume at this time. We have, however, slightly increased our investment in the Tier 2 space in an effort to continue our learning and additional credit pockets that we believe will provide future opportunity.\nThe weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.1%, an increase of 170 basis points from the same period last year and in line with Q1. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.1% as a combination of previous lender tightening and consumer hesitation specially in the lower credit tiers drove the majority of reduction versus the 21.6% penetration observed last year. Tier 3 accounted for 6.4% of sales as compared to 6% last year as lenders benefited slightly from CAF and Tier 2s tightening.\nCAF income for the quarter was $135 million, down from $183 million in the same period last year. This $48 million year-over-year decrease is driven by a $90 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by $60 million of growth in interest and fee income as well as a $14 million increase in loss provision. Note, our interest expense was impacted by a negative $1.2 million fair market value adjustment from our hedging strategy versus a positive $9.4 million adjustment seen in the same period last year.\nWithin the quarter, total interest margin on the full portfolio decreased to $265 million, down $30 million from the same period last year. The corresponding margin to receivables rate of 6.1%, however, has leveled off as expected and is in line with Q1. I am proud of the team's continued ability to effectively manage finance margin, CAF penetration and sales conversion to benefit CarMax as a whole. The loan loss provision in Q2 of $90 million results in an ending reserve balance of $538 million or 3.08% of ending receivables. This is compared to a reserve of $535 million last quarter, which was 3.11% of receivables.\nThe slight reduction in the reserve to receivables rate is a function of the portfolio tightening, partially offset by the modest additional investment in the Tier 2 business and adjustments on loss expectations within the existing portfolio. We believe the tightening will have a positive impact on the future required reserve, but we will also continue to look for opportunities to capture long-term profitability for CarMax while maintaining a targeted Tier 1 cumulative net credit loss rate of 2% to 2.5%. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon and Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we believe the steps we are taking in response to the current environment are supporting our business in the near term, while also positioning us well for the long run. We will continue to focus on delivering what we believe is the most customer-centric experience in the industry as we prioritize initiatives that drive operational efficiencies and make our Omni Channel experience faster, simpler and more seamless for our associates and customers.\nSome examples from the second quarter include for online, we're rolling out a number of new capabilities that enhance our digital shopping experience. In our Customer Experience Centers, or CECs, we launched a new order processing system. Sales orders generated through the new system automatically connect to customers' online accounts and to our progression tracker. This tool guides customers through each step of the car-buying journey and provides a more seamless experience for customers who prefer to blend self-progression with assistance from associates.\nWe've begun testing the system in our stores, which will unlock this functionality for all of our customers regardless of where they start their buying journey. We are also expanding capabilities for Sky, our 24/7 virtual assistant. As you might recall, Sky enables us to efficiently assist customers via automated chat functionality while taking work out of our CEC system. In addition to supporting workflows related to the finance applications, vehicle transfers and appointment reservations, Sky is now able to identify customers who have an appraisal instant offer.\nSky helps these customers complete the next steps for their trade-in, Previously, associates would have to reach out to provide further support. We've been pleased with our customers' adoption of Sky as they progress in their shopping journey. For our stores, we're continuing to leverage data automation to reduce costs and improve transaction speed and accuracy. We have deployed an integrated payoff service in our business office, which allows associates to obtain automated payoff amounts for over 40% of the lenders holding titles for the cars we bought from consumers. In many instances, this service also enables us to receive titles faster by expediting payoffs.\nFor our auctions, we continue to test enhancements to our platform by upgrading the information we provide dealers, which enables them to submit more informed bids. For example, we launched a test using technology from our investment in partnership with [ UBI ] that provides more detailed information on tire conditions, including brand, speed, size and tread depth of each tire. Dealer feedback in this offering has been positive, and we plan to roll out other enhancements in the upcoming quarters.\nBefore turning to Q&A, I want to recognize 2 significant milestones in the company's history. First, this June, we celebrated the 2-year anniversary of welcoming all the talented Edmunds associates to our team. We're very excited with the value that we have created together so far as we continue to build out our vehicle and customer acquisition programs. For example, as I previously mentioned, we utilized the Edmunds sales team to sign up and support dealers for our Max offer product, which has enabled us to extend our market-leading position as a buyer of cars.\nWe also recently launched an appraisal tool for dealer websites that makes instant offers based on CarMax's algorithm that are redeemable via Max offer. We have received positive feedback from dealers that are utilizing this service and are pleased with the initial results. Additionally, Edmunds has launched a number of research and buy tools in support of our goal to be the leader in used EV sales. I'd like to speak to 3 of these.\nFirst, Edmunds has conducted hands-on range testing of more than 60 EVs, which enables us to provide insights into how far a vehicle will go on a single charge and its energy consumption. Beginning in late 2022, we partnered with [ Recurrent ] a leader in EV battery health analytics. This allowed Edmunds to become the first online car shopping resource to offer intelligence to consumers about the health and range of used EV batteries at the VIN level.\nSecond, we've launched customized range maps on Edmunds.com that enable customers to determine how far they can drive on a single charge based on ZIP code specific to their route. And third, we have built Guide to help customers evaluate potential tax credits and incentives for EVs. These cover all available Federal and State EV programs plus thousands of incentive offers from local utilities and municipalities across the country with more to come. Also this month, we are celebrating CarMax's 30th anniversary.\nI want to thank and congratulate all of our associates for the work that they do. They are the differentiator and they are the key to our success. Not many companies have the opportunity to revolutionize an industry twice. We're proud to have reshaped the used car industry by driving integrity, honesty and transparency in every interaction. We are excited to reshape the industry again by offering a uniquely personalized car buying experience that enables customers to do as much or as little online and in-stores they want. We're confident in the future of our diversified business model and believe the deliberate steps we are taking today will drive growth in the years ahead.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Chelsea?"

Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in queue for more follow-ups. Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Although the first quarter remained challenging due to the same factors we cited in fiscal '23, we're seeing sequential quarterly improvements across our business. We are focused on controlling what we can as we take delivered steps to support our business both the near term and the long run. This quarter, we reduced SG&A independent of the legal settlement. We delivered strong retail GPU, we increased use saleable inventory units while driving down total inventory dollars 13% year-over-year, we drove strong wholesale GPU as our unit volume continued to recover. And finally, we grew CAF penetration even as we raised CAF's consumer rates to help offset higher cost of funds and tightened lending standards in reaction to the current environment.\nFor the first quarter of FY '24, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, down 17% compared to last year, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 9.6% and used unit comps were down 11.4% which reflects an improvement from down 22.4% and 14.1% year-over-year during last year's third and fourth quarters. Average selling price declined approximately $1,600 per unit or 5% year-over-year. First quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,361, consistent with the $23.39 last year. Historically, margin tends to run higher during the first quarter compared to the rest of the year.\nIn the current environment, we expect this year's second quarter and full year margins will be similar to last year, slightly ahead of the full year $2,100 to $2,200 range that we spoke to last quarter. As always, we'll continue to test price elasticity and monitor the competitive landscape. Wholesale unit sales were down 13.6% versus the first quarter last year, which reflects continued improvement from the 36.7% and a 19.3% year-over-year decline during last year's third and fourth quarter. Average selling price declined approximately $2,000 per unit or 18% year-over-year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was 1,042, in line with 1,029 during last year's first quarter. We bought approximately 343,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter down 5% from last year and an improvement from the 40% and 22% year-over-year declines during last year's third and fourth quarters. Of these vehicles, we purchased approximately $323,000 from consumers in the quarter with a little more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience.\nAs a result, our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. We sourced the remaining approximately 20,000 vehicles through dealers, up 20% from last year, supported by our [ Edmond ] sales team. In regard to our first quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 11% last year. Approximately 54% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, which is consistent with the prior year. Nearly all of our first quarter wholesale auctions sales, which represents 20% of total revenue remain virtual in our considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%, which is in line with last year.\nCarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $137 million, down from $204 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contributions in a few moments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on managing what is in our control drove another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year performance across key financial metrics, including unit sales, SG&A leverage, gross profit and EPS. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $1.44, down from $1.56 a year ago. Included in our EPS this quarter was the equivalent of $0.28 or $59 million related to a legal settlement. Total gross profit was $817 million, down 7% from last year's first quarter. Used retail margin of $515 million in wholesale vehicle margin of $168 million declined 9% and 12%, respectively. The year-over-year decreases were driven by lower volume across retail and wholesale. This was partially offset by strong margin performance with both retail and wholesale per unit margins up slightly from last year's numbers.\nOther gross profit was $135 million, up 12% from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by service, which delivered $4 million in margin, a $26 million improvement over last year. As we communicated in our Q4 FY '23 year-end earnings call, our expectation is that service will deliver improved year-over-year performance in FY '24, driven by the efficiency and cost coverage measures that we put in place. Our first quarter has us off to a solid start. The improvement in service was partially offset by reductions in extended protection plan or EPP revenues and third-party finance fees. EPP revenues were down $5 million, primarily due to lower sales partially offset by stronger margins that were implemented at the end of last year's first quarter. Third-party finance fees were down $3 million to last year's first quarter. Lower volume in Tier 2 for which we receive a fee was partially offset by a reduction in Tier 3 volume for which we pay a fee.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter were $560 million, down 15% from the prior year's quarter. Excluding the benefit from the legal settlement, SG&A was down 6% from the prior year's quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our cost management efforts. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 68%. Excluding the benefit from the settlement, our SG&A leverage was 76%, roughly flat to last year's first quarter. The change in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following factors.\nFirst, other overhead decreased by $79 million, of which $59 million was due to the settlement. The balance of year-over-year favorability was driven by several factors, including favorability in non-GAAP uncollectible receivables, which benefited partially from timing, favorability in costs associated with lower staffing levels and a variety of other smaller costs.\nSecond, we reduced advertising by $17 million. While our advertising expense on a total dollar and per unit basis was lower year-over-year on the quarter, our investments for the quarter on a per unit basis remained aligned with last year's second half spend level.\nThird, total compensation and benefits, excluding a $13 million increase in share-based compensation decreased $15 million. This decrease was primarily driven by our continued focus in stores and CECs on aligning staffing levels to sales and driving efficiency gains. As I noted in our Q4 FY '23 year-end call, we expect to require low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A for the full FY '24 year, well below the levels we guided to during the investment-heavy phases of our omni transformation. As a result, we expect to deliver a stronger flow-through of gross profit to profitability. Our first quarter performance has us on track to deliver on this goal.\nWhile we delivered SG&A leverage -- SG&A leverage point in the mid-70% range in the first quarter, it is important to remember that the first quarter is typically our strongest for SG&A leverage as it's historically our highest used unit volume and margin per unit quarter. Regarding capital structure, our first priority remains to fund the business. While our adjusted net debt to capital ratio was slightly below our 35% to 45% targeted range, given ongoing market uncertainties, we continue to appropriately manage our net leverage to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole.\nIn keeping with this goal of maintaining flexibility, we continue to pause our share buybacks in the first quarter. Our $2.45 billion authorization remains in place as does our commitment to return capital to shareholders over time. Additionally, post quarter calendar end, we successfully renewed our $2 billion revolving lending facility with materially similar terms. We plan to include additional information in our forthcoming 10-Q, which we plan to file on Monday.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated $2.3 billion, resulting in penetration of 42.7% net of 3-day payoffs, up from 39.3% observed during the first quarter last year. This growth in penetration came despite cash credit tightening within the higher risk, higher APR portion of Tier 1 as well as the reduction of CAF's targeted volume of Tier 3 that began at the end of Q4. Despite the decrease of volume in these higher APR segments, the weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.1% an increase of 20 basis points from Q4 and 200 basis points from the same period last year. Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 20.4% up from Q4, but still down from the historically high 25.2% seen in Q1 of [indiscernible]. Tier 3 penetration was 6.7%, down 40 basis points from last year. While CAF and other lending partners have tightened lending standards over the previous few quarters, our robust multi-lender credit platform was still able to approve approximately 95% of credit applications during the first quarter.\nCash income for the quarter was $137 million, down from $204 million in the same period last year. This $67 million year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by a $23 million increase in loss provision as well as a $94 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by growth in interest and fee income. Note, our interest expense was impacted by a negative $9 million fair market value adjustment from our hedging strategy versus a positive $9 million adjustment seen in the same period last year.\nWithin the quarter, total interest margin decreased to $258 million, down $40 million from the same period last year. The corresponding margin to receivables rate of 6.1% continued to come down from the 10-year peak seen in last year's first quarter but has moderated in its decline from previous quarters, as was expected and previewed during last quarter's conference call. The slowing in NIM reduction comes as a result of targeted rate increases on new originations executed over the last year that effectively manage cap penetration, finance margin and sales conversion to generate the most valuable outcome for CarMax as a whole. The loan loss provision in Q1 of $81 million results in an ending reserve balance of $535 million or 3.11% of ending receivables. This is compared to a reserve of $507 million last quarter, which was 3.02% of receivables. The sequential 9 basis point adjustment in the reserved receivable ratio reflects unfavorable performance within the existing portfolio as well as the uncertain macro environment.\nDespite this increase, the existing Tier 1 portfolio continues to trend within the targeted 2% to 2.5% cumulative net credit loss range and the recent tightening is expected to provide a reduction in loss rate for future originations. Regarding continued improvements in our best-in-class prequalification product. During the first quarter, we began broadly scaling yet another of our large lending partners within FBS, our finance-based shopping platform. This marks the sixth lender that is now capable of providing millions of additional customized credit decisions in minutes to our online customers. While we continue to add enhancements to our online credit experience, we believe our FBS platform is currently an industry leader and truly empowers consumers by providing simple access to penny perfect multi-lender credit decisions in seconds while having no impact to their credit for.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon. Over the past several years, we've built a leading omnichannel platform that enables us to deliver what we believe is the most customer-centric experience in the industry. Our ability to offer integration across digital and physical transactions gives us access to the largest total addressable market and is a key differentiator. With our core omni capabilities now in place, we are continuing to prioritize projects that drive operating efficiencies and optimize experience for our associates and customers. We believe the steps we will be taking enable us to further expand our competitive moat and will position us well for the future.\nSome examples from the first quarter beyond what Jon just spoke about related to CAF include. One, as we work to deliver a seamless digital first shopping experience, we are increasingly leveraging Sky, our 24/7 virtual assistant. Sky enables us to efficiently assist customers via chat functionality while taking work out of our CEC system. During the first quarter, we expanded these capabilities to include work flows related to finance applications, vehicle transfers and appointment reservations. Since going live, we've had great success reducing CEC work volume routed to associates, enabling us to provide a quicker response at a lower cost per transaction. We anticipate rolling out additional functionality to Sky throughout fiscal 2024.\nSecond, we are currently rolling out Express drop-off which enables customers with instant offer or store-generated appraisals to progress the selling process from home. When utilized this option offers customers the ability to complete their transaction at one of our stores in under 30 minutes and our research shows that customers and associates both love this experience. Finally, we're continuing to modernize our auction platform to enhance the experience for dealers. This quarter, we launched an integrated check-in experience that enables single sign-on across our systems and streamlines access to the information that dealers rely on the most when bidding on vehicles.\nAdditionally, we initiated proxy bidding capabilities in a limited number of markets. This allows dealers to bid on vehicles in advance so they don't have to participate live during each auction. It also unlocks the ability to take part in multiple auctions and bid on multiple vehicles simultaneously. Feedback on both of these capabilities has been positive. We plan to expand proxy bidding to additional markets as well as launch other enhancements in upcoming quarters.\nWith our focus on improving experiences and gaining efficiencies, we believe we are well positioned to emerge from the current environment and even stronger company. We're confident in the future of our diversified business model and believe that the deliberate steps that we are taking will enable us to drive robust growth as the market improves.\nWith that, we will be happy to take your questions. Chelsea? Chelsea, can you remind folks how to enter the question portal."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Lowenstein, AVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid L. Lowenstein\n\nAssistant Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Carlos. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance Operations.\nLet me remind you our statements today that are not statements of historical fact, including statements regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our current knowledge, expectations and assumptions and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, we disclaim any intent or obligation to update them.\nFor additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC this morning and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, previously filed with the SEC. Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations department at (804) 747-0422 extension 7865.\nLastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The current challenges in the used auto industry are well documented with affordability pressured by broad inflation, climbing interest rates, tightening lending standards and prolonged low consumer confidence. We are continuing to leverage our strongest assets, our associates, our experience and our culture to build momentum and manage through this cycle. While there are many macro factors that we cannot control, we have taken delivered steps to support our business, both the near term and the long run.\nThis quarter, we reduced SG&A further. We delivered strong retail GPU through our vehicle acquisition, reconditioning and margin management strategies while continuing to test price elasticity. We adjusted offers to deliver strong wholesale GPU while increasing unit sales quarter-over-quarter. We aligned used saleable inventory units with market conditions while driving down total inventory dollars more than 25% year-over-year.\nAnd finally, we raised CAF's consumer rates to help offset rising cost of funds while still growing CAF's penetration. We are prioritizing initiatives that drive efficiency and improve experiences for our associates and customers. We believe these steps will enable us to come out of this cycle leaner and more effective while also positioning us for future growth.\nReflecting on fiscal '23, we achieved a number of key milestones in each area of our diversified business model. We enabled online self-progression for all of our retail customers, enhanced our wholesale shopping experience and completed the nationwide rollout of our finance-based shopping prequalification product. All of these accomplishments further position our business for growth as the most customer-centric experience in the industry. I'll talk more about these later in the call.\nAnd now on to our results for the fourth quarter of FY '23. Our diversified business model delivered total sales of $5.7 billion, down 26% compared to last year, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 12.6% and used unit comps were down 14.1%. Average selling prices declined approximately $2,700 per unit or 9% year-over-year. In addition to the macro factors I mentioned previously, we believe our performance continued to be impacted by transitory competitive responses to the current environment.\nOur market share data indicates that our nationwide share of 0 to 10-year-old vehicles remained at 4% for calendar year 2022. External title data shows that the market share gains we achieved during the first half of the year were offset by share losses during the second half of the year as we prioritize profitability over near-term market share. For context, we have lost some market share during prior down cycles. In those cases, we recovered the market share and then continue to grow to new heights as economic conditions improved. We remain focused on achieving profitable market share gains that can be sustained for the long-term and plan to continue running extensive price elasticity tests. The results from our most recent tests confirmed that holding margins during the quarter was the right profitability play.\nDespite the decrease in average selling price, fourth quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $22.77, up $82 per unit year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to appropriately value vehicles and effectively manage margin and inventory. Wholesale unit sales were down 19.3% versus the fourth quarter last year but improved from the 36.7% decline during this year's third quarter as our total buys from consumers and dealers improved sequentially. Wholesale average selling price declined approximately $3,200 per unit or 28% year-over-year, though we saw some appreciation beginning in January.\nWholesale gross profit per unit was $11.87, which is consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Margin benefited from the recent price appreciation I just mentioned and from strong dealer demand, particularly at the end of the quarter. We bought approximately 262,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the quarter down 22% from last year's record but a sequential improvement from the 40% decline during this year's third quarter. Our self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. We purchased approximately 247,000 cars from consumers in the quarter with a little more than half of those [ buys ] coming through our online instant appraisal experience. We sourced approximately 15,000 vehicles through dealers, up 4% from last year.\nIn regard to our fourth quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online, up from 11% in the prior year. Approximately 52% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, down from 55% in the prior year. Nearly all of our fourth quarter wholesale auctions and sales, which represents 18% of total revenue, remained virtual and are considered online transactions. We began a small wholesale auction simulcast test during the quarter to gauge dealer interest in resuming in-person attendance and will continue to test options for live attendance during FY '24.\nTotal revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%, down slightly from last year. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $124 million, down from $194 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contribution in a few moments.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on managing what is in our control drove a sequential improvement from the third quarter across key financial metrics, including EPS, gross profit and SG&A.\nFourth quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.44, down from $0.98 a year ago. Total gross profit was $611 million, down 14% from last year's fourth quarter. Used retail margin of $387 million and wholesale vehicle margin of $143 million declined 9% and 20%, respectively. The year-over-year decreases were driven by lower volume across used in wholesale. This was partially offset by strong margin per unit performance. Used unit margins increased from last year's fourth quarter and wholesale margins per unit were flat year-over-year.\nOther gross profit was $81 million, down 24% from last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by a decline in extended protection plan or EPP revenues. In addition to the impact of lower retail unit sales, profit sharing revenues from our partners decreased from $33 million in last year's fourth quarter to $16 million in this year's quarter. This was partially offset by stronger margins and a favorable year-over-year return reserve adjustment. Penetration was flat year-over-year at approximately 60%.\nThird-party finance fees were relatively flat over last year's fourth quarter, with lower volume and fee generating Tier 2, offset by lower Tier 3 volume for which we pay a fee. Service was also relatively flat over last year's fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement in year-over-year performance. We have maintained our technician staffing levels and have put in place key efficiency and cost coverage goals for our teams. This supports our expectation of improved performance in FY '24 compared to the full FY '23 year. The extent of this improvement will also be governed by sales performance given the leverage deleverage nature of service.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the fourth quarter were $573 million, down 8% from the prior year's quarter and down 3% sequentially from this year's third quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was higher than the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to the 14% decrease in total gross profit dollars compared to last year's quarter.\nThe change in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to the following factors. First, we reduced advertising by $34 million. Second, total compensation and benefits decreased $17 million which included an $18 million increase in share-based compensation. Excluding the latter, compensation and benefits was down $35 million, of which $18 million was due to a lower corporate bonus accrual in the quarter. Third, other overhead increased by $6 million. The year-over-year increase in investments in our technology platforms and strategic growth initiatives was primarily the result of decisions made in prior quarters. This was partially offset by a favorable year-over-year comparison due to costs incurred in last year's fourth quarter associated with a significant ramp in staffing and favorability in a variety of other smaller costs this year.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to take steps to better align our expenses to our sales. This included further reducing staffing through attrition in our stores and CECs, limiting hiring and contractor utilization in our corporate offices and continuing to align our marketing spend to sales. While our advertising expense on the dollar and per unit basis was lower year-over-year on the quarter, our investment for the quarter and full year on a per unit basis remains aligned with last year's full year spend level.\nFor fiscal '24, in total, we anticipate maintaining per unit spend at a similar level to FY '23 with per unit spend varying from quarter-to-quarter. We believe that at this point, we largely have the resources in place to meet our near-term omnichannel and other digital investment needs. Accordingly, our expectation is that we will bend the expense growth curve on our omnichannel investments and our overall SG&A.\nIn FY '24, we expect to acquire low single-digit gross profit growth to lever SG&A, well below the levels we've guided to during the investment-heavy phases of our omni transformation. As a result, we expect to deliver a stronger flow-through of gross profit growth to profitability. While we expect that the front half of the year will benefit from the cost management actions we took in the back half of FY '23, the magnitude of the year-over-year benefit relative to the 8% decrease we experienced in Q4 may be muted, particularly in Q1. This dynamic stems from rolling over a more comparable period for advertising and the corporate bonus accrual in Q1 than the fourth quarter declines that I noted earlier.\nWhile not providing specific guidance beyond FY '24, we expect that this bending of the SG&A growth curve will carry over beyond this year. This will support our pathway back to a lower SG&A leverage ratio with the initial goal of returning to the mid-70% range over time. Hitting this range will also require healthier consumer demand.\nRegarding capital structure. Our first priority remains to fund the business. Given the recent performance and ongoing market uncertainty, we continue to take a conservative approach to our capital structure. While our adjusted net debt to capital ratio was slightly below our 35% to 45% targeted range, we are managing our net leverage to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole. In keeping with this goal of maintaining flexibility, we continue to pause our share buybacks. Our $2.45 billion authorization remains in place as does our commitment to return capital to shareholders over time.\nFor capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $450 million in FY '24, similar to our FY '23 level. This spend is primarily being driven by investments in land and the build-out of facilities related to long-term growth capacity for production and auctions. New store development is also contributing to CapEx, albeit at a lower level as we have slowed the pace of openings in FY '24. In FY '24, we plan to open 5 new locations, including 2 more stores in the New York City metro market as well as our first off-site production location in the Atlanta metro market. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continues to be a competitive advantage for CarMax.\nOur liquidity remains very strong, and we ended the quarter with approximately $315 million in cash on the balance sheet and no draw on our $2 billion revolver. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the fourth quarter, CarMax Auto Finance originated $1.9 billion, resulting in penetration of 44.7% net of 3-day payoffs, up from the 41% seen in the same quarter last year and in line with Q3. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers at 10.9% was up 110 basis points from Q3 and 270 basis points from the same period last year. We were pleased with our ability to increase consumer rates within the quarter while maintaining a consistent share of finance contracts sequentially and growing our share of finance contracts substantially on a year-over-year basis.\nTier 2 penetration in the quarter was 19.4%, lower than typical seasonal levels. Tier 3 penetration was flat to last year at 6.9%. While our long-term lending partners continue to complement each other and providing strong credit offers to our customers, we did observe year-over-year tightening as both rising interest rates and delinquencies likely led to these adjustments. Of note, CAF has also adjusted its underwriting standards in reaction to the current environment, including towards the end of Q4 and reducing its targeted percentage of Tier 3 volume from 10% to 5%.\nCAF income for the quarter was $124 million, down from $194 million in the same period last year. The $70 million year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by a $44 million increase in loan loss provision as well as a $61 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by growth in interest and fee income. Within the quarter, total interest margin decreased to $262 million, down $22 million from the same quarter last year. The corresponding margin to receivables rate of 6.3% is down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year and 125 basis points from the near 10-year peak seen in this year's first quarter, driven mostly by the significant interest rate jumps absorbed during the past year.\nIn response, we have made numerous pricing moves over the last 12 months, including in the fourth quarter that should cause the reduction in margin to slow and allow this portfolio rate to level off in fiscal year 2024. The loan loss provision in Q4 of $98 million results in an ending reserve balance of $507 million or 3.02% of ending receivables. This is compared to a reserve of $491 million last quarter which was 2.95% of receivables. This sequential 7 basis point adjustment in the reserved receivable ratio reflects unfavorable performance within the portfolio as well as the uncertain macro environment. Along with the continued increase in cash Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume. We continue to target and operate within the 2% to 2.5% cumulative net credit loss range for our core Tier 1 portfolio, and we believe we are appropriately reserved for future losses.\nRegarding further advancements in our credit technology, we continue to stabilize and improve upon our nationally available best-in-class prequalification product, Finance-based Shopping or FBS. During the fourth quarter, we fully deployed yet another of our large lending partners within the FBS platform now bringing the total to 5 well-established lenders that are providing decisions on the full vehicle inventory for an applicant and co-applicant, leveraging a soft credit pool. Note what truly makes this product distinct in the used auto industry is our ability to calculate over 6 million unique credit decisions every minute from multiple finance sources, each leveraging their own distinct credit models. And then to make these offers digitally available to customers wherever they are shopping in the store, at home or walking the lot.\nDuring this upcoming first quarter, we hope to add additional finance partners to the platform as work is already well underway. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon and Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of the call, even as we navigated the challenges of fiscal '23, we achieved a number of key milestones during the year by focusing on making our omnichannel experience faster, simpler and more seamless for our associates and customers. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on our journey to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the industry.\nSome highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact across our diversified business model are for retail, we enabled online self-progression capabilities for all of our customers. As we evolve our omnichannel experience, we're also updating our operating models to drive efficiency gains in our stores.\nDuring the year, we launched self-checking capabilities for appraisal customers and also enhanced E-sign functionality to better enable self-progression. Our e-commerce engine, combined with our unparalleled nationwide fiscal footprint is a competitive advantage. Our ability to deliver integration across digital and physical transactions is a key differentiator in both the experience we provide in the total addressable market available to us.\nFor wholesale, we rolled out a modernized mobile-friendly vehicle detail page that displays the most relevant information from dealers that they need to preview our wholesale inventory. Creating a shopping experience for dealers that is similar to how consumers shop our retail inventory. We also expanded Max offer, our digital appraisal product for dealers to approximately 50 markets, which enable us to build on our leading position as a buyer of cars. We utilize our Edmond sales team to sign up new dealers for the service, which provides profitable incremental wholesale volume.\nFor credit and CAF, we completed the nationwide rollout of finance-based shopping, our multi-lender prequalification product, as Jon mentioned, this gives customers the flexibility to digitally receive quick credit decisions from a majority of our lenders across the entire vehicle inventory. Over 80% of our customers have used this online tool as they begin the credit process. In addition, CAF is equally focused on coming out of this cycle leaner and more effective. The team is already leveraging the new loan receivable system that we deployed a little over a year ago to deliver on savings opportunities with many more expected in the upcoming years.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '24, we will build on last year's initiatives and prioritize projects that unlock operating efficiencies and create better experiences for our associates and customers. We are confident that the actions we will take position us better to capture the upside when the market improves. Some examples include: for retail, we are leveraging data science, automation and AI to make it even easier for customers to complete key transaction steps on their own and to go back and forth between assisted health and self-progression. We are also building digital tools that will support customers across key transaction steps in their journey and give them better insight into their remaining steps. These tools will drive online sales and make it easier for customers to opt in to express pickup.\nThis delivery option offers customers the ability to complete their transaction at one of our stores in as little as 30 minutes and represents a win-win opportunity. Our research shows that customers love this experience when utilized, and it will enable us to lower costs over time.\nFor wholesale, we will leverage our modernized vehicle detail page to offer new services. Some examples include AI-enhanced condition reports and proxy bidding capabilities. We will also improve Max offer by rolling out our instant offer experience to all participating dealers. These tools will enable us to drive incremental operational efficiencies as we continue to scale our wholesale volume, all while providing a better experience. For CAF, we're working to integrate our finance based shopping product into our stores and customer experience centers more seamlessly so that all consumers can enjoy the full experience. As Jon mentioned, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to add additional lenders to the platform which will expand the breadth and depth of offers available to our customers.\nWhile these are a few good examples, our entire organization from Edmond's to logistics is focused on improving efficiencies and experiences. We are confident in the future of our diversified business. We will continue to evaluate our performance relative to our long-term financial targets annually. As we start fiscal '24, we are affirming the targets that we updated in April '22, and selling between 2 million and 2.4 million vehicles through our combined retail and wholesale channels by fiscal '26, generating between $33 billion and $45 billion in revenue by fiscal '26 and growing our nationwide market share of 0 to 10-year-old vehicles to more than 5% by the end of calendar '25.\nI want to thank and congratulate all of our associates for the work they do. They are our strongest differentiator and the key to our success. Last week, Fortune Magazine named CarMax as one of its 100 Best Companies to Work for, for the 19th year in a row. I am incredibly proud of this recognition, particularly as we faced a challenging year. It's due to our associates' commitment to supporting each other, our customers and our communities every day.\nOver our nearly 30-year history, we've navigated many challenging environments and have emerged stronger each time. This environment is no different, and I'm confident that the actions we are taking will enable us to drive robust growth as the market improves.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Carlos?"

Welcome to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Lowenstein, AVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lowenstein\n\nAssistant VP of IR, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; and Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance Operations.\nLet me remind you our statements today that are not statements of historical fact, including statements regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of widespread pressures across the used car industry. Vehicle affordability remained challenging due to macro factors stemming from broad inflation, climbing interest rates and continued low consumer confidence. In addition, persistent and steep depreciation impacted wholesale values throughout the quarter.\nIn response, we have been taking deliberate steps to support our business for both the short term and for the long run. We are leveraging our strongest assets, our associates, our experience and our culture to manage through this cycle. Actions that we took during the quarter include further reducing SG&A, selling a higher mix of older, lower-priced vehicles, slowing (inaudible) in light of the steep market depreciation, maintaining used saleable inventory units while driving down total inventory dollars more than 25% year-over-year raising CAFs consumer rates to help offset rising cost of funds, pausing share buyback to give us capital flexibility and slowing our planned store growth for next fiscal year to 5 locations while maintaining our ability to open more locations if market conditions change.\nIn the near term, we are prioritizing initiatives that unlock operational efficiencies and create better experiences for our associates and our customers. While we continue to selectively invest in initiatives that have the potential to activate new capabilities, we have slowed the pace of those investments. We believe these steps will enable us to come out of this cycle leaner and more effective while positioning us for future growth. We will provide more details on these actions later during today's call.\nAnd now on to our results. For the third quarter of FY '23, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $6.5 billion, down 24% compared with last year's third quarter, driven by lower retail and wholesale volume. In our retail business, total unit sales in the third quarter declined 20.8% and used unit comps were down 22.4% versus the third quarter last year when we achieved a 15.8% used unit comp.\nIn addition to the macro factors that I mentioned previously, we believe our performance was impacted by transitory competitive responses to the current environment. External title data indicates that we gained market share on a year-to-date basis through October, though we've seen some recent loss of share. As we have said before, we are focused on profitable market share gains that can be sustained for the long term. Through expansive price elasticity testing, we determined that holding margins during the quarter was the right profitability play.\nThird quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,237 which is consistent with last year's third quarter. Wholesale unit sales were down 36.7% versus the third quarter last year, driven by rapidly changing market conditions, which included about $2,000 of depreciation. This is incremental to approximately $2,500 of depreciation experienced during the second quarter. Wholesale performance was also impacted as we continue to reallocate some older vehicles from wholesale to retail to meet consumer demand for lower-priced vehicles. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $966 down from a third quarter record of $1,131 a year ago.\nRecall, last year, prices appreciated approximately $2,500 during the quarter, which was a margin tailwind. Just as we are doing in retail, we will continue to focus on maximizing total wholesale margin profitability. We bought approximately 238,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the third quarter, down 40% versus last year's period. Our volume was impacted by steep depreciation and our deliberate decision to slow buys in reaction to the depreciation. We purchased approximately 224,000 cars from consumers in the quarter with about half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. We also sourced about 14,000 vehicles through Max offer, our digital appraisal product for dealers, up 16% from last year's third quarter.\nOur self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. In regard to our third quarter online metrics, approximately 12% of retail unit sales were online, up from 9% in the prior year's quarter. Approximately 52% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter down from 57% in the prior year's quarter. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represent 18% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 28%, down from 30% during last year's third quarter. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $152 million, down from $166 million during the same period last year. Jon will provide more detail on consumer financing, the loan loss provision and cash contribution in a few moments.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance and the steps we've taken to further align our business to the current sales environment. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.24, down from $1.63 a year ago. Total gross profit was $577 million, down 31% from last year's third quarter. Used retail margin of $403 million and wholesale vehicle margin of $115 million declined 21% and 46%, respectively. The year-over-year decreases were driven by lower volume across used and wholesale and lower wholesale margin per unit. .\nAs Bill noted, we continue to face depreciation and have been adjusting accordingly to better position ourselves to manage through the current environment. Other gross profit was $59 million, down 49% from last year's third quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the effect of lower retail unit sales on service and EPP. Service results declined $37 million as lower sales and secondarily, our decision to maintain technician staffing levels drove some deleveraging. Technicians are among the most in-demand associates in the industry and the retention will position us strongly to quickly grow inventory when we exit the current cycle.\nEPP fell by 14% or $15 million, reflecting the decline in sales that was partially offset by stronger margins and a favorable year-over-year return reserve adjustment. Penetration was stable at approximately 60%. Third-party finance fees were relatively flat over last year's third quarter with lower volume and fee generating Tier 2, offset by lower Tier 3 volume for which we pay a fee.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter were $592 million, up 3% from the prior year's quarter, reflecting a slowdown from the year-over-year increases of 19% during the first quarter and 16% during the second quarter of this year. In the prior year's third quarter, we received a $23 million settlement from a class action lawsuit. Adjusting for that settlement, SG&A actually would have declined 1% year-over-year this quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was materially pressured as compared to the third quarter last year due primarily to the 31% decrease in total gross margin dollars compared to last year's quarter.\nThe change in SG&A dollars over the last year was mainly due to the following factors: first, a $41 million increase in other overhead primarily driven by cycling over last year's legal settlement. We also continue to invest, although at a reduced pace in our technology platforms and strategic and growth initiatives. Second, an $18 million reduction in compensation and benefits, including a $16 million decrease in share-based compensation; and third, a $17 million reduction in advertising.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to take steps to better align our expenses to our sales. This included further reducing staffing through attrition in our stores and CECs, limiting hiring and contractor utilization in our corporate offices and continuing to align our marketing spend to sales. While our advertising expense was lower year-over-year, our investment on a per unit basis remains consistent with last year's third quarter. We remain focused on reducing expenses and anticipate continued progress in the fourth quarter.\nRegarding capital structure. Our first priority is to fund the business. Given third quarter performance and continued market uncertainties, we are taking a conservative approach to our capital structure. While our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was below our 35% to 45% targeted range, we are managing our net leverage to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole.\nIn keeping with this goal of maintaining flexibility, we took the following steps this quarter in addition to the SG&A actions I spoke to. First, we paused our share buybacks. Our $2.45 billion authorization remains in place as does our commitment to return capital back to shareholders over time. Second, we slowed the velocity of our CapEx spend. We expect CapEx will end the fiscal year at approximately $450 million versus our previous $500 million estimate.\nAs Bill mentioned, we have also conservatively planned store growth for 5 new locations in fiscal year 2024. Our liquidity remains very strong. We ended the quarter with over $680 million in cash on the balance sheet and no draw on our $2 billion revolver.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the strength and stability of our credit platform provided approvals to over 95% of the consumers who applied for credit during their shopping journey. CarMax Auto Finance originated $2.1 billion within the quarter, resulting in a penetration of 44.4% net of 3-day payoffs, up from 42.2% realized in the same quarter last year and 41.2% in Q2. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9.8%, which was higher than the 8.3% in last year's third quarter and the 9.4% seen in Q2. We continue to leverage our scalable testing environments and nimble underwriting infrastructure to strategically pass along a portion of the increased funding costs to consumers while still increasing share of the finance contracts.\nTier 2 penetration in the quarter was 20.5%, in line with historical levels, but down from last year's 22.2%. Tier 3 financed 6.1% of used unit sales compared to 6.5% a year ago. Our lenders continue to make their own independent lending decisions in this challenging environment, and we remain pleased with the competitive offers they are collectively able to provide to our customers. Cash income for the quarter was $152 million, a decrease of 8.3% or $14 million from the same period last year. Our loan loss provision was $86 million resulting in an ending reserve balance of $491 million. This is compared to a provision of $76 million in last year's Q3. The current quarter's reserve of $491 million is 2.95% of managed receivables, up slightly from 2.92% at the end of this year's second quarter. This sequential 3 basis point adjustment in the reserved receivables ratio comes primarily from the continued addition of Tier 2 and Tier 3 receivables into the overall portfolio as seen in previous quarters.\nAll in all, we were pleased with the credit performance within our portfolio during the quarter, and we believe we are appropriately reserved for future losses. Further, we continue to be in a strong position to leverage our unique credit platform to operate our Tier 1 business within our targeted loss range of 2% to 2.5%.\nWithin the quarter, total interest margin dollars were flat to last year at $277 million, modestly supported by a $5 million benefit from our hedging strategy. The corresponding margin to receivables rate, 6.7% was down 54 basis points year-over-year as receivables with historically low funding costs were offset by the receivables impacted by the more recent Fed moves.\nRegarding advancements in our broader credit technology. During the third quarter, we successfully completed the nationwide rollout of finance-based shopping, our multi-lender prequalification product, and we continue to see a high level of engagement with this experience. As a reminder, this gives customers the ability to digitally receive quick credit decisions across our entire inventory via our simple online application with no impact to credit scores. This also allows consumers to quickly and easily secure financing at any point in their shopping journey.\nLike the rest of the business, CAF is also focused on driving efficiencies. We are already seeing benefits from the modern, more nimble receivable servicing system that we launched a year ago. Consumer finance is a highly regulated and ever-changing space, and our new system allows us to adapt more easily to these necessary changes. A recent example is California's upcoming regulatory change that requires added disclosure and refund requirements related to the cancellation of the GAP waiver product. With our old system, the implementation would have been lengthy and onerous, and we likely would have temporarily suspended the product in the state while we made the changes. However, with our new, more agile technology, we are able to incorporate these requirements without interrupting. This is just one example of our early wins resulting from our new system, and we have a clear line of sight to many more in the near and midterm.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon, and thank you, Enrique. As I mentioned at the start of today's we're taking steps to support our business by prioritizing projects that unlock operating efficiencies and create better experiences for our associates and customers. It starts with making our omnichannel experience faster, simpler and more seamless. Some examples include we are enhancing online features to help customers feel more confident in completing key transaction steps on their own and make it easier to go back and forth between assisted health and self-progression.\nWe're also making it simple for consumers to opt in to express pickup through self-progression. This delivery option offers customers the ability to complete their transaction at one of our stores in as little as 30 minutes and represents a win-win opportunity. Our research shows that customers love this experience when utilized, and it will enable us to lower our costs over time. Our final example is that we are working to seamlessly integrate our finance-based shopping product into our stores and customer experience centers so that all consumers can enjoy this experience, not just those who shop online. At the same time, we are adding additional lenders to the platform to expand the breadth and depth of offers available to our customers.\nAs we evolve our omnichannel experience, we are also updating our operating models to drive efficiency gains in our stores. For example, in our business offices, we have launched self-check-in capabilities for appraisal customers and have also enhanced e-sign functionality to better enable self-progression. Additionally, we are testing an improved digital customer queue to better manage appointments as well as new software to improve title speed and visibility. We anticipate these tools will enable us to reduce associate time spent per customer and shorten customer transaction times. Our associates are key to providing an exceptional customer experience, and we are focused on leveraging their skills in the most value-added manner.\nWe will also continue to selectively invest in key projects that have the potential to deliver new capabilities while lowering our costs. Examples include first, we're updating Max offer, our appraisal product for dealers, which is available in approximately 50 markets. Many of our dealers are still on the initial version, which does not provide instant offers and requires them to take instant vehicle pictures. We are rolling out a new product, which offers a fully digital instant offer experience to all dealers. We believe this will well position us to grow our dealer buys more efficiently and support higher volume over time.\nSecond, we are leveraging technology to enhance our logistics capability. We move approximately 2 million vehicles each year. We estimate that our internal logistics operation drives about a 20% cost advantage over third-party providers and improves our speed, predictability and control of moves. Enhancements to our transportation management system will enable us to consolidate loads, increase our mix of full loads and reduce the truck volume in and out of our stores. This will support our ability to keep our costs low as we complete moves even faster and more efficiently.\nThird, we are continuing to upgrade our auction experience. During the third quarter, we scaled our modernized vehicle detail page to 50% of dealers. This page is mobile-friendly, provides more relevant data to our dealers and improve search and filter functionality. It is also the springboard that we will use to launch capabilities we believe will further enhance our wholesale business, including AI-enhanced condition reports and proxy bidding. We are confident that our focused initiatives will drive efficiencies and grow our business over the long term.\nIn closing, we have spent almost 30 years building a diversified business that can profitably navigate the ups and downs of the used car industry. We have a strong balance sheet and access to capital. Our experience in inventory and margin management is the strength and we will continue to be thoughtful and manage our expenses pulling levers as necessary. While we're not able to predict how long the industry will remain challenged, we believe the pressures are transitory and that we are well positioned to manage through them and emerge an even stronger company. I want to thank our associates for everything that they're doing to support each other, our customers and our business our foundation remains strong, and we're excited about the future of our diversified business model.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Ashley?"

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lowenstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lowenstein\n\nAssistant VP of IR, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Samara. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance Operations.\nLet me remind you our statements today that are not statements of historical fact, including statements regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance, are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our current knowledge, expectations and assumptions and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nIn providing projections and other forward-looking statements, we disclaim any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC this morning and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, previously filed with the SEC. Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations department at (804) 747-0422 extension 7865.\nLastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I get started, I want to share that my thoughts are with our associates, their families and communities that are being impacted by Hurricane Ian. We have a significant number of stores in the storm's path, and as always, the safety of our associates is our top priority. We've taken steps to support our associates and our communities, and we will continue to monitor the situation and take actions to provide assistance as needed.\nNow to our results. This quarter reflects widespread pressure the used car industry is facing. Macro factors, including vehicle affordability that stem from persistent and broad inflation, climbing interest rates and low consumer confidence, all led to a market-wide decline in used auto sales. In addition, wholesale values were affected by steep depreciation in the quarter.\nDespite the impact of these factors on our results, we continued to grow market share. We also continue to make progress on the key initiatives that will further strengthen our competitive differentiation over time. We have weathered a number of difficult cycles in our history and each time, we have successfully managed through them and have leveraged key learnings to further strengthen our operating model. We remain on track to achieve our long-term strategy and goals.\nFor the second quarter of FY '23, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8.1 billion, up 2% compared with last year's second quarter, driven by growth in average selling prices, partially offset by lower retail and wholesale volume. In our retail business, total unit sales in the second quarter declined 6.4%, and used unit comps were down 8.3% versus the second quarter last year.\nOur performance was impacted by the macro factors that I mentioned previously. We believe industry sales were also impacted by a shift in consumer spending prioritization from large purchases to smaller discretionary items. In response to the current environment and consumer demand, we have continued to offer a higher mix of lower-priced vehicles.\nWe began the second quarter with a low single-digit decline in comp sales during the June that reflected a continuation of softer although improving sales, which we discussed on our last earnings call. Comps then fell sharply at the beginning of July with August ending in mid-teen declines.\nLast quarter, we reported market share data. We will do that again this quarter as the data provides additional context and highlights our performance relative to the industry. Based on external data, we continued to gain share through July, the latest period for which title data is available. We reported second quarter retail gross profit per used unit of $22.82, up $97 per unit versus the prior year period, a reflection of our ability to manage used margin in any environment.\nWe continue to focus on striking the right balance between covering cost increases, managing margin and passing along efficiencies to consumers to support vehicle affordability.\nWholesale unit sales were down 15.1% versus the second quarter last year, partially as a result of our deliberate decision to reallocate some older vehicles from wholesale to retail to meet consumer demand for lower-priced vehicles. We estimate that without this shift, our wholesale units would have been down less than 10%. Performance was also impacted by depreciation of about $2,500 and as we intentionally slow buys in reaction to rapidly changing market conditions.\nWholesale gross profit per unit was $881, down from $1,005 a year ago and reflected softening market conditions as well as our decision to retail a higher mix of older used vehicles. Our ability to source these vehicles from consumers is a competitive advantage. But relative to younger vehicles, more of them fall out during the reconditioning process as they are not able to meet our standards for consumer sales. When that happens, we wholesale those vehicles, often at lower-than-normal margins.\nIn the third quarter, we have been focused on aligning our offers to current conditions and adjusting inventory to more efficiently incorporate older vehicles.\nBuying vehicles at appropriate prices per market conditions is one of our core competencies. We bought approximately 343,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the second quarter. While down 8% versus last year's period, this was up approximately 50% from the second quarter of FY '21 and reflects customers' responsiveness to both our nationwide online instant offer tool and our offers.\nWe purchased approximately 323,000 cars from consumers in the quarter, down 11% versus last year's record results. We also sourced approximately 20,000 vehicles through Max offer, our digital appraisal product for dealers. This was up 130% versus last year's period and up 18% compared to this year's first quarter.\nOur self-sufficiency remained above 70% during the quarter. We remain focused on providing the most customer-centric experience in the industry with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates buying and selling cars with our best-in-class store experience.\nIn regard to our second quarter online metrics, approximately 11% of retail unit sales were online, up from 9% in the prior year's quarter. Approximately 53% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, down slightly from 55% in the prior year's quarter. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual. So 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 21% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%. This is up from 28% in last year's second quarter.\nCarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $183 million, down from $200 million during the same period last year. As a reminder, last year's quarter benefited from a reduced provision coming out of the pandemic. We will continue to provide strong credit offers to our customers as we move rates with the market. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF contributions in a few minutes.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance as well as the steps we are taking to further align our expenses to the current sales environment. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.79, down from $1.72 a year ago. Total gross profit was $737 million, down 9.6% from last year's second quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by wholesale vehicle margin of $141 million, which was down 26%. The year-over-year decrease was driven by both lower volume and margin per unit. As Bill noted, we faced sharp depreciation throughout the quarter and have been adjusting accordingly to better position ourselves to manage through the current environment.\nTotal used vehicle margin was down slightly at $495 million, a decrease of 2%. Total used unit volume of negative 6.4% was largely offset by higher margin per unit. Other gross profit was $102 million, down 15% from last year's second quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the effect of lower retail unit sale on service. Service results declined $13 million as lower sales and secondarily, impacts from inflationary pressures drove a deleverage in results.\nEPP fell by 3% or $3 million, reflecting the combined effects of stronger margins, stable penetration at approximately 60% and the decline in retail unit sales. Third-party finance fees were flat over last year's second quarter as lower volumes in fee-generating Tier 2 were offset by lower Tier 3 volume for which we pay a fee.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter increased to $666 million, up 16% from the prior year's quarter, reflecting a slowdown from the year-over-year increase during the first quarter. Approximately 3 points of the increase this quarter reflects a change in an accounting estimate in the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percent of gross profit deleveraged to 90.4% from 70.4% during the second quarter last year. A key contributor of deleverage was a 9.6% decrease in total gross margin dollars compared to last year's quarter.\nThe increase in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to 2 factors. First, a $50 million increase in other overhead. The primary drivers of this increase include investments to advance our technology platforms, strategic and growth initiatives, a $14 million onetime impact from a prior year change in an accounting estimate related to non-GAAP uncollectible receivables, and a variety of other smaller cost headwinds. Second, a $34 million increase in compensation and benefits excluding share-based compensation, primarily driven by the annualization of the strong growth in staffing we experienced in the back half of last year as well as wage pressures.\nPartially offsetting this increase was a $4 million decrease in share-based compensation.\nDuring our first quarter earnings call, we discussed how we have actively taken steps to better align our staffing expenses in our stores and Customer Experience Centers, or CECs, to the sales levels we were experiencing at the time. However, as Bill noted, sales declined sharply in the second quarter versus our expectations starting in July.\nAccordingly, during the second quarter, we pulled additional levers to further align our expenses to our sales levels. We expect these savings will materialize more fully in the coming quarters. This included further reducing staffing through attrition in our stores and CECs, pausing on a portion of the hiring and contractor utilization in our corporate offices as well as better aligning marketing spend to sales.\nIn regard to marketing, our intent is to continue to maintain a strong level of investment on a per-unit basis that is at least consistent with the full year FY '22 levels. For the second quarter, total marketing dollars were flat year-over-year but reflected a robust investment on a per-unit basis.\nAs part of our omnichannel journey, we have reduced the variable cost component of our operating structure. Given the macro environment, our near-term priority will be on allocating resources towards those initiatives that will further drive efficiency and effectiveness across our fixed costs. At the same time, we will continue to selectively invest in customer-facing initiatives that will enhance our omnichannel experience and support our long-term growth.\nFrom a capital structure perspective, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $163 million.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. Once again, the CarMax Auto Finance business delivered solid results while transitioning from a lending environment that has seen historically low levels of credit loss and extremely favorable funding costs. During the second quarter, CAF's net loans originated was over $2.3 billion. CAF's penetration in the second quarter net of 3-day payoffs was 41.2% compared with 43% last year and 39.3% in Q1. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9.4%, which was higher than the 8.5% in last year's second quarter and the 9% seen in Q1. This rate increase, combined with the quarter-over-quarter increase in penetration, reflects CAF's ability to strategically pass along a portion of the added funding cost to consumers while still providing highly competitive offers.\nOur lending partners continue to complement each other in also providing attractive credit offers. Our Tier 2 penetration rate was consistent with last year at 21.6%, and Tier 3 accounted for 6% of used unit sales compared with 7.2% a year ago. Although the lower credit consumer continues to show demand by actively shopping and applying for credit, they continue to be challenged with affordability and being able to complete the purchase.\nCAF income for the quarter was $183 million, a decrease of 8.6% or $17 million from the same period last year. Last year, our loan loss provision of $35 million was a significant tailwind as the overall performance of the consumer remained remarkably strong. This quarter's $76 million provision results in an ending reserve balance of $478 million or 2.92% of managed receivables, up from 2.85% last quarter. This 7 basis point adjustment is once again predominantly attributed to the proportionately higher quarterly volume of Tier 2 and Tier 3 loan originations compared to the preexisting $16 billion portfolio.\nOf note, as the macroeconomic conditions pose a challenge to the credit consumer, we remain confident in our ability to leverage our vast experience and robust credit platform to ensure our Tier 1 credit losses remain comfortably within our targeted operating range of 2% to 2.5%. As we've seen last quarter, our provision headwind was significantly offset by our total interest margin, which grew $31 million year-over-year. Our margin of 7.29% was up 11 basis points from last year's second quarter and was supported by a $9.4 million benefit from our hedging strategy.\nRegarding our industry-leading online finance experience, during the quarter, we significantly expanded our prequalification product launched in March. As a reminder, this unique multi-lender product results in no impact to your credit score and generates customized real-time credit decisions on our full inventory. As of the end of the second quarter, this product was available to over 50% of our consumers and is expected to go nationwide during the third quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. Given the realities of the macro environment, we will further sharpen our focus on driving additional operational efficiencies as we continue to navigate the near-term pressures facing the used car industry. At the same time, we will remain focused on continuing our work to achieve our long-term goals, including further improving our omnichannel experience for both our customers and associates as well as growing our diversified business model.\nSome of our key initiatives include: first, we are leveraging data science, automation and AI to improve efficiency and effectiveness within our customer experience centers. During the second quarter, we expanded our associate-facing guided action software from chat to phone calls and developed additional work streams for our consumer-facing digital assistant. Over time, we anticipate these tools will enable us to reduce associate time spent per customer as we enhance our ability to provide live interactions at the highest-value moments.\nSecond, as Jon mentioned, we continue to scale our industry-leading finance-based shopping experience. This best-in-class prequalification product leverages a streamlined, simple application and generates multi-lender credit terms on cards within our retail inventory in just minutes. With this tool, customers have all the information they need to quickly understand APRs and monthly payments across different contract terms and effortlessly compare vehicles to ultimately secure the right financing options for them.\nThird, we are expanding MaxOffer to acquire vehicles and build on our market-leading position as a buyer of cars. As a reminder, buying directly from consumers and dealers lowers our acquisition costs, enhances our inventory selection and provides profitable incremental wholesale volume. We are currently live in over 40 markets and anticipate launching additional markets later this year.\nFinally, we are upgrading our auction experience to be even more user-friendly. We're testing a modernized vehicle detail page to be mobile-friendly and efficiently display the most relevant information dealers need to preview our wholesale inventory, similar to how customers shop our retail inventory. We're also testing AI capabilities to enhance our online vehicle condition reporting.\nIn addition, we have rolled out self-service checkout capabilities nationwide. These tools will enable us to drive incremental operational efficiencies as we continue to scale our wholesale volume, all while providing an even better experience to our wholesale dealers.\nAs I close, I want to reiterate that while the market conditions and consumer behaviors remain challenging, we believe that these pressures are transitory and that our foundation remains strong. We are well positioned to navigate this environment as we have during challenging times in the past and remain excited about the future of our diversified business.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. For the first quarter of FY '23, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $9.3 billion, up 21% compared with last year's first quarter driven by growth in average selling prices and wholesale volume gains, partially offset by a decline in retail used units sold. Across our retail wholesale channels, we sold approximately 427,000 cars in total during the first quarter, down 5.5% versus last year's period.\nIn our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter declined 11% and used unit comps were down 12.7% versus the first quarter last year. Our performance was driven by the same macro factors that led to a market-wide decline in used auto sales during the quarter, including lapping material stimulus benefits paid in the prior year, widespread inflationary pressures, including challenges to vehicle affordability and lower consumer confidence.\nWe began the first quarter with a double-digit decline in comp sales during March, continuing the fourth quarter performance we discussed in our last earnings call. Comps then improved sequentially with May ending in a low single-digit decline. While we don't intend to talk about it each quarter, market share data provides additional context to our performance and indicates that our relative performance remains strong. Based on external data, we gained share each month from January through April, the latest period for which title data is available.\nWe believe this share gain reflects the strength of our business model and omnichannel platform, which gives us the ability to successfully manage through cycles like this one. In short, we remain focused on delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver a profitable market share gains in any environment.\nWe reported first quarter retail gross profit per used unit of $2,339, up $134 per unit versus the prior year period. We continue to focus on striking the right balance between covering cost increases, maintaining margin and passing along efficiencies to consumers to support vehicle affordability. Wholesale units were up 2.7% versus the first quarter last year despite a calendar shift, which negatively impacted auction volume compared with the prior year.\nWholesale volume was also pressured by our decision to reallocate some older vehicles from wholesale to retail to meet consumer demand for lower-priced vehicles. We estimate that without these 2 factors, our wholesale unit growth would have been above 10%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,029, in line with $1,025 a year ago.\nWe are pleased that we continue to drive wholesale unit growth even as we lapped last year's nationwide launch of our instant online appraisal offering on carmax.com and in the face of the industry-wide decline in used sales. We believe our wholesale business provides an incremental growth lever and is a valuable component of our diversified business model. We bought approximately 362,000 vehicles from consumers and dealers during the first quarter, up 6% versus last year's period. We continue to be the nation's largest buyer of vehicles from consumers purchasing approximately 345,000 cars in the quarter, up 3% versus last year's record results.\nThis enabled our self-sufficiency to remain above 70% during the quarter. We also sourced approximately 17,000 vehicles through our MaxOffer, our digital appraisal product for dealers that we mentioned during our last call. This was up 183% versus last year's period. As a reminder, buying directly from consumers and dealers lowers our acquisition costs, enhances our inventory selection and provides profitable incremental wholesale volume.\nCarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, delivered income of $204 million, down from $242 million during the same period last year as the provision for loan losses normalized versus last year's favorable adjustment. Jon will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision and CAF's contribution in a few moments.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $1.56, down from $2.63 a year ago. While the decline in used sales was a key contributor, the comparison was also impacted by the following 2 items: first, as Jon will discuss, an $82 million year-over-year swing in the provision for loan losses, reflecting a more normalized environment; second, earnings in last year's first quarter reflected a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment.\nTotal gross profit was $875 million, down 5% from last year's first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the 11% drop in total used unit sales, which was partially offset by the increase in retail gross profit per unit and the continued growth in wholesale units. Wholesale vehicle margin was $192 million, up 3% despite the headwinds in the quarter that Bill noted. Other gross profit was $120 million, down 15% from last year's first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the effects of lower retail unit sales on service and EPP profits.\nService results declined $31 million as lower sales and secondarily, impacts from inflationary pressures drove a deleveraging results. EPP gross profit decreased by $18 million or 13%, slightly more than the retail unit sales rate decline. While penetration was stable at approximately 61%, this year's first quarter also reflected a $2.3 million unfavorable shift in the return reserve adjustments versus last year's period.\nPartially offsetting this decline in other gross profit was favorability in third-party finance income, which improved by $8 million, with income of $3.4 million compared to a cost of $4.6 million last year. This improvement was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year's first quarter. First quarter also benefited from $20 million of margin contribution from Edmunds.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $657 million, up 19% from the prior year's quarter due to an increase in staffing costs and marketing, the continued investment in our strategic initiatives, growth costs related to the increase in appraisal buys and new stores and the consolidation of Edmunds. SG&A as a percent of gross profit deleveraged to 75% from 59.9% during the first quarter last year.\nThe increase in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to 3 factors: first, a $61 million increase in compensation and benefits, excluding share-based compensation, driven by the annualization of the strong growth in staffing we experienced in the back half of last year; the inclusion of Edmunds' payroll this quarter versus a year ago, wage pressures; and the ramp in field staffing in anticipation of a stronger tax season. Partially offsetting this increase was a $16 million decrease in share-based compensation.\nSecond, a $26 million increase in other overhead. The primary drivers of this increase include investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives as well as growth-related costs. Third, a $16 million increase in advertising expense. This increase was primarily due to last year's lower level of spend in the first quarter, given our event tight inventory position and robust customer demand. In addition, this quarter's spend had anticipated a stronger tax season.\nWe've navigated many challenging consumer cycles throughout our history and remain committed to operating efficiently and effectively in every macro environment. We have already begun to better align staffing in our stores and CECs to consumer demand as part of our ability to quickly adapt our business.\nFrom a capital structure perspective, we remain in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with an adjusted debt to capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%. We also generated sufficient cash to both pay down our revolver by more than $580 million and increased the pace of our share repurchase program relative to the back half of fiscal year '22. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $158 million.\nFirst quarter also marked our entry into the New York City metro market. We opened a store in Edison, New Jersey. And in the second quarter, we expect to open stores in Wayne, New Jersey and East Meadow, New York. We anticipate adding 2 more stores in this market next year.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. CarMax Auto Finance business delivered solid results again this quarter despite the volatile broader lending environment. During the first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was over $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9%, which was in line with the year ago but has significantly increased from 8.2% in the previous quarter. The majority of this quarter-over-quarter change came from increased rates charged to consumers rather than from the mix of credit.\nAs the Fed clearly signaled the interest rate hikes at the beginning of the calendar year, CAF was able to quickly test and methodically adjust consumer rates to carefully manage sales, finance margin and penetration. As a result of these proactive rate changes, CAF's penetration in the first quarter, net of 3-day payoffs, was 39.3% compared with 43.7% last year. Of importance, CAF saw its penetration level improved during the quarter as we observed banks and credit unions raising their own consumer rates during this period.\nOur Tier 2 partners continue to compete for the attractive CarMax business, resulting in a penetration rate of 25.2% compared with 22.8% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 7.1% of used unit sales compared with 10% a year ago, and we believe this is an indication that these customers have been impacted the most by challenges to vehicle affordability.\nCAF income for the quarter was $204 million, a decrease of 15% or $37 million from the same period last year. I want to take a moment to clarify the year-over-year swing in our loan loss provision. You will recall that last year, CAF recognized $24 million of income in Q1 related to the loan loss provision as we continue to adjust our reserve based on favorable loss performance versus expectations set at the start of the COVID pandemic. CAF's loan loss provision this quarter was $58 million, reflecting a more normalized dollar amount given the loss performance observed within the quarter.\nSignificantly offsetting the provision headwind was our total interest margin, which grew $53 million year-over-year, including a $36 million increase in interest and fee income and a $17 million reduction in interest expense. The lower interest expense was supported by a $9 million benefit from our hedging strategy.\nThe current quarter's provision of $58 million resulted in an ending reserve balance of $458 million or 2.85% of managed receivables. This is a slight increase from the 2.77% at the end of the fourth quarter and includes a 5 basis point adjustment for the growth in Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume originated by CAF. We remain confident in both the resiliency of the CAF consumer and our ability to serve them well. While delinquency rates have increased, our Tier 1 credit losses remain comfortably within our historical operating range of 2% to 2.5%.\nAt this point, I would like to also provide an update on our industry-leading online finance experience. As a reminder, our unique finance-based shopping engine, or FBS, allows for multiple lenders to decision a single customer or co-applicants on our entire retail inventory, providing a full suite of personalized decisions available at the consumers' fingertips within carmax.com.\nDuring the month of March, we further enhanced this experience by trusting a no impact to your credit score prequalification feature along with the streamlined application process that provides real-time credit decisions on our full inventory. We are extremely excited about the results thus far. It is currently available to approximately 25% of our online customers and we anticipate scaling nationwide during the rest of the year.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. For the past several years, our priorities and investments have focused on building a leading e-commerce platform that integrates buying and selling cars with our best-in-class store experience. I'm pleased to share that during the first quarter, we achieved a significant milestone as we have now enabled online self-progression capabilities for all of our retail customers. Our journey at this point required a massive organizational transformation, and I want to thank all our associates for their tremendous support throughout as we work together to create our omnichannel experience for our customers.\nIn regard to our first quarter online metrics, approximately 11% of retail unit sales were online, up from 8% in the prior year's quarter. Approximately 54% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, down slightly from 56% in the prior year's quarter. Online, omni and in-person sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on consumer preferences and how they choose to interact with us. While we expect our online and omni sales to grow over time, our goal is to provide the best experience, whether that's in-store, online or a seamless combination of the 2.\nOur wholesale auctions remain virtual. So 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%. This is up from 24% in last year's first quarter. Our e-commerce engine, combined with our unparalleled nationwide physical footprint, is a competitive advantage. Our ability to deliver integration across digital and physical transactions gives us access to the largest total addressable market relative to others in our industry and is a key differentiator.\nWe're now going to turn our efforts to further improving the experience for our customers and our associates by focusing on the seamlessness of our online and in-store offerings. Some of our key areas of focus include: first, as Jon just mentioned, we're deploying a more sophisticated version of our finance-based shopping product. As interest rates rise, consumers' ability to confidently secure financing is more important than ever. The expansion of our best-in-class prequalification product, once fully deployed, will provide frictionless and seamless access to multi-lender credit terms on every car within our retail inventory whether the consumer chooses to browse and purchase from the comfort of their home, walk the lot on their own with their mobile device or shop alongside one of our exceptional sales consultants.\nA second area of focus is continuing to leverage data science, automation and AI to improve efficiency and effectiveness across our buying organizations, business offices and Customer Experience Centers. Finally, we will continue to use MaxOffer to acquire vehicles and build on our market-leading position as a buyer of cars. With MaxOffer, we can utilize the Edmunds sales team to open new markets and sign up new dealers for the service. It's another example of our ongoing focus on innovating and finding new opportunities in the white space adjacent to our existing capabilities.\nWe are currently live in over 30 markets and anticipate launching additional markets throughout FY '23. Staying on Edmunds for a moment, I want to acknowledge that as of June 1, we reached the 1-year anniversary of this acquisition. We are glad to have all of the talented Edmunds' associates on our team and have been very pleased with the value that's been created so far. We are equally excited about our path forward as we continue to build out together our vehicle and customer acquisition programs.\nBefore closing, while I want to acknowledge there's uncertainty in the market and in regard to consumer behavior, we believe that our fundamentals are strong and that our diversified business model enables us to gain profitable market share in any environment. Multiple opportunities exist to grow the business as we roll forward, and we're excited about the future.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Orlando?"

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 CarMax Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your (inaudible), Mr. David Lowenstein, AVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Lowenstein\n\nAssistant VP of IR, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning. Thank you for joining our Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance Operations.\nLet me remind you, our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.\nFor additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the company's Form 8-K issued this morning in its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, filed with the SEC. Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations department at (804) 747-0422 extension 7865.\nLastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. .\nFor the fourth quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, up 49% compared with last year's fourth quarter, driven by growth in average selling prices and wholesale volume gains partially offset by a decline in used units sold. Net earnings was $159.8 million for the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.98, down 23% from a year ago.\nDuring our call in December, we shared that we were pleased with our sales performance at the start of the fourth quarter. However, we began to see pressure after the holidays that continue through the end of the quarter.\nIn our retail business, total unit sales in the fourth quarter declined 5.2% and used unit comps were down 6.5% versus the fourth quarter last year. We believe several macro factors weighed on market-wide used car sales including consumer confidence, vehicle affordability, the Omicron COVID surge and lapping stimulus benefits paid in the prior year period.\nWhile the fourth quarter used market was challenging, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments for fiscal 2022, and we believe we are well positioned for continued long-term success across our retail and wholesale business and CarMax Auto Finance. Our full year results reflect significant growth in sales, market share and earnings as well as a solid progress on our strategic initiatives. In fact, our retail market share growth this past year was the highest it has been during my tenure as CEO and is a reflection of our focus on delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry.\nOur market share data indicates that our nationwide share of 0 to 10-year-old vehicles grew 13% from 3.5% in calendar 2020 to 4.0% in 2021. Despite posting a decline in sales during our fiscal fourth quarter, comparing our results to published used vehicle SAAR data suggest that we continue to take share during the quarter. We believe we are well positioned to deliver profitable market share gains in any environment.\nAcross our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 343,000 cars in total during the fourth quarter, up to 11% versus last year's period. For the fiscal year, we sold approximately 1.6 million retail and wholesale cars combined, up 38% year-over-year.\nWe continue to be the nation's largest buyer of vehicles from consumers. We bought approximately 324,000 cars from consumers during the quarter, up 69% versus last year's period. For the fiscal year, we bought approximately 1.4 million cars from consumers, up 95% year-over-year. Self-sufficiency continued to be strong during the fourth quarter, remaining above 70%. We reported fourth quarter retail gross profit per used unit of $2,195, up $109 per unit versus the prior year period.\nWith used car prices remaining elevated, we chose to pass along some of our self-efficiency acquisition cost savings to consumers via lower prices. We believe we struck the right balance between covering inflationary costs, maintaining margin and keeping our vehicles more affordable. Our approach reflects our continuation of our commitment to doing what's right for the customer, which ultimately drives the growth of our business.\nWholesale unit sales were up 43.8% from the fourth quarter last year, and gross profit per unit was $1,191 compared to $990 a year ago. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering. Wholesale valuations remained historically high during the quarter, which supported margin relative to the fourth quarter last year.\nCarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $194 million, up from $188 million during the same period last year. In a few minutes, John will provide more detail on customer financing and CAF contributions, but at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance. Enrique?\n\nEnrique N. Mayor-Mora\n\nSenior VP & CFO, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. .\nTotal gross profit was $711 million, up 11% from last year's fourth quarter. This increase was driven primarily by wholesale vehicle margin of $177 million, which was up 73%. The continued growth of the wholesale business is providing us with a strong gross profit lever. Used vehicle margin of $427 million was relatively flat over last year's fourth quarter, with the decrease in units largely offset by an increase in margin per unit.\nOther gross profit was $107 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. This decrease reflected a $33 million decline in service profit primarily due to the deleverage driven by the reduction in sales and the staffing and efficiency impacts from the Omicron COVID surge in the fourth quarter. Our intent continues to be to operate service-as-a-profit center, which from quarter-to-quarter can be impacted by sales trends and staffing disruptions.\nPartially offsetting this decline was favorability in EPP and third-party finance fees as well as $20 million of margin contribution from admins. EPP grew by $6.3 million or 5% year-over-year for the quarter, with penetration stable at approximately 60%. This favorability was driven by an $11 million year-over-year net benefit from the recognition of profit sharing revenues and adjustments to our cancellation reserves.\nRecall from our second quarter call in September, one of our providers implemented a timing shift in their performance period for profit sharing revenues. All of our providers now utilize the same timing, which aligns recognition as applicable to our fourth quarter.\nThird-party finance fees improved by $4.7 million with income of $1.8 million, compared to a cost of $2.9 million last year. This improvement was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year's fourth quarter.\nOn the SG&A front, expenses for the fourth quarter increased to $621 million, up 23% from the prior year's quarter due to continued investment in our strategic initiatives and in marketing, the consolidation of Edmunds and growth costs related to the increase in appraisal buys, new stores and customer support at our customer experience centers, or CECs. SG&A as a percent of gross profit deleveraged to 87.3% from 79% during the fourth quarter last year. This deleverage was primarily due to the decline in sales that occurred in the quarter.\nThe increase in SG&A dollars over last year was mainly due to 3 factors. First, a $43 million increase in total compensation and benefits driven by our continued strong ramp in staffing, including proactive staffing in anticipation of tax season and wage increases. Additionally, we had a $16 million increase in annual bonus-related compensation plus the inclusion of admin's payroll this quarter versus a year ago. Partially offsetting this increase was a $42 million decrease in stock-based compensation.\nSecond, a $40 million increase in other overhead. The primary drivers of this increase include investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives as well as growth-related costs.\nThird, a $19 million increase in advertising expense through our ongoing plan to drive customer acquisition and amplify the CarMax brand by continuing to build awareness of our omnichannel offerings.\nFor the full year, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 70.7%, leveraging approximately 1 point over last year's percentage of 71.6%. Our approach to SG&A and costs heading into next year remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our business. At the same time, we remain committed to ensuring that we are efficient and effective in our spend, and we continue to target areas of focus that we expect will deliver results over time.\nWe expect to require an increase beyond the 5% to 8% range of gross profit growth to lever in FY '23. This is largely driven by the timing of strategic investments and growth-related costs as well as heightened inflationary pressures. While we expect to remain in investment mode over the next few years, we expect our leverage point to go back down after FY '23. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our core business, consider new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships or acquisitions and return excess capital to our shareholders.\nIn regard to our share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 872,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $102 million. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares for $561.6 million, and as of March 31, 2022, we had $721.7 million of authorization remaining. As communicated today, our Board of Directors has expanded our share repurchase authority by $2 billion with no expiration time line. The Board's authorization reflects CarMax's ongoing commitment to long-term shareholder value creation through growth and return of capital.\nFor capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $500 million in FY '23. This increase in spend is driven by long-term growth capacity initiatives for our auction, sales and production facilities in addition to continued investments in technology. In FY '23, we plan to open 10 new locations, including our first 3 stores in the New York City metro market. Our extensive nationwide footprint and logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax, and we remain committed to an appropriate level of investment on these differentiated assets.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon G. Daniels\n\nSVP of CarMax Auto Finance, CarMax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone.\nOur CarMax Auto Finance business delivered strong results once again. For the fourth quarter, CAF's penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 41% compared with 43.5% last year. Tier 2 increased to 23.7% of used unit sales compared with 21% last year, and Tier 3 accounted for 6.7% of sales compared with 9.5% a year ago. Year-over-year reduction in CAF's penetration is attributed to a larger percentage of customers coming in with outside financing.\nOur Tier 2 partners continue to provide highly competitive credit offers as they compete for additional volume within the Max channel. These strong offers, along with the decrease in conversion in the lower portion of the credit spectrum driven by higher average selling prices and corresponding monthly payments, contributed to the swap and penetration between Tiers 2 and 3.\nDuring this year's fourth quarter, CAF's net loans originated was nearly $2.1 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.2%, down from 8.5% a year ago and 8.3% in the third quarter. The difference in EPR is primarily a result of the credit mix of customers booking with CAF.\nCAF income for the quarter was $194 million, an increase of 3% or $6 million from the same period last year. Total interest margin increased $64 million, driven by $42 million in higher interest and fee income from our continued growth in receivables and $22 million in lower interest expense from the past ABS deals that continue to provide value over time. This improvement in CAF's margin and the growth in average managed receivables more than offset a substantial increase in the provision for loan losses, which was a more normalized $54.4 million in the current year's fourth quarter versus $4.6 million in the prior year's fourth quarter.\nIn the prior year's fourth quarter, the provision for loan losses benefited from the continued reduction in the reserve that was established at the start of the COVID pandemic. The current quarter's provision of $54 million resulted in an ending reserve balance of $433 million or 2.77% of managed receivables. This is largely consistent with the 2.75% at the end of the third quarter and includes a 3 basis point adjustment for additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume originated by CAF.\nI also want to take the opportunity to highlight a few of the accomplishments made since our last call regarding our online finance experience. As a reminder, nearly 2/3 of our customers begin their financing process on carmax.com, applying on any vehicle in our inventory or simply a requested dollar amount. Our unique finance-based shopping engine, available to most of our customers, allows for multiple lenders to decision a single customer or co-applicants on our entire inventory to provide a full suite of personalized decisions available at the consumer's fingertips. This tool is incorporated into the search page within carmax.com, allowing the user to sort and filter not only on the vehicles characteristics, but also on important finance terms such as monthly payment and down payment. During the month of March, we further enhanced this experience and are now testing a no-impact-to-your-credit-score feature, along with the streamlined application process that provides real-time credit decisions on our full inventory. We believe that our differentiated multi-lender platform, coupled with these and additional enhancements that are on the horizon, will further strengthen our digital shopping experience.\nNow, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.\n\nWilliam D. Nash\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CarMax, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. .\nAs I mentioned earlier in this call, I am very proud of how we performed in fiscal 2022. We bought and sold more vehicles than ever before through our retail and wholesale platforms. We've continued to innovate, to aggressively invest in core areas of our business and to pursue new growth opportunities. As a result of these efforts, we've achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in our market share, and we believe we are well positioned to take even more share. We have continued to build out new and enhanced capabilities, and as those capabilities have come to market, we have continued to see positive returns.\nSome highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact are, first, enabling online self-progression capabilities currently available to approximately 90% of our customers with full availability for every customer anticipated by the end of this first quarter. Next, leveraging our online instant appraisal offering to buy a record number of cars directly from consumers, which enable us to nearly double our self-sufficiency as we drive -- as well as drive sustainable wholesale unit growth. Also, transitioning CAF's legacy auto loan receivable servicing system to brand-new technology, which provides CAF a modernized foundation for growth and allows us to enhance our customer experience.\nAnd finally, rolling out the finance-based shopping capabilities that Jon just described. Our e-commerce engine, combined with our unparalleled nationwide physical footprint, is a key value to our customers and helps us provide what we believe is the best experience in the used car industry. Our ability to offer seamless integration across digital and physical transactions gives us access to the largest total addressable market and is a key differentiator, one that we will continue to enhance.\nIn regard to our fourth quarter online metrics, approximately 11% of retail unit sales were online, up from prior year's quarter of 5%. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 31%. This is up from 17% in last year's fourth quarter. Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 51% in the prior year's quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, we bought approximately 162,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal. That represents about half of our total buys from consumers. This fiscal year, we bought approximately 707,000 cars through this channel, again, representing roughly half of our total buys from consumers. Going forward, we will continue to evolve our online and in-store capabilities to enable a more seamless experience for our associates and customers.\nI would like to highlight 4 key areas of focus for FY '23. First, as John mentioned earlier, we're deploying a more sophisticated version of our finance-based shopping capability that enables real-time decisions and offers our customers the ability to prequalify for a loan with no impact to their credit score. Second, adding self-service capabilities to enhance in-store interactions, including appraisals and express pickups. Third, growing vehicle acquisition through attracting new customers and pursuing partnerships as we expand our appraisal offering to dealers and other businesses. And finally, continuing to leverage data science, automation and AI to improve efficiencies and effectiveness across our buying organization, business offices and CEC.\nAgain, we're very proud of the strong results for fiscal '22 as they are in large part due to our relentless focus to provide our customers the best experience in the industry. We are in a strong position moving forward, and we'll continue to invest and innovate to achieve profitable market share growth.\nDuring our Analyst Day last May, we announced long-term targets of achieving 2 million combined retail and wholesale units sold and $33 billion of revenue in FY '26, up from $1.2 million and $19 billion, respectively, during FY '21. Though we don't anticipate updating our targets annually, our strong performance in FY '22 has given us a new perspective on these targets that we believe is appropriate to share at this time. We're revising our FY '26 targets to reflect a range of 2 million to 2.4 million combined units with revenue between $33 billion and $45 billion. These ranges reflect the macro factors we had earlier that could result in ongoing volatility in consumer demand and vehicle pricing.\nIn regard to market share, I'm excited for the future and confident that we will expand it beyond 5% by the end of calendar 2025.\nLast, but most importantly, I want to thank all of our associates for the work that they do. They are truly the keys to our success. Just yesterday, Fortune Magazine named CarMax as 1 of its 100 Best Companies to work for for the 18th year in a row. I'm incredibly proud of this recognition as it is due to our associates' commitment to supporting each other, our customers and our communities every day. I want to thank and congratulate all of our associates.\nWith that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Welcome to the Q3, Fiscal Year 2026, CarMax Earnings Release Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Lowenstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lowenstein\n\nVP of Investor Relations, CarMax\n\nThank you, Nikki. Good morning, everyone.\nThank you for joining our fiscal 2026 Q3 earnings conference call. I'm here today with Tom Folliard, Interim Executive Chair of the Board; David McCreight, Interim President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, Executive Vice President, CarMax Auto Finance. Let me remind you, our statements today that are not statements of historical fact, including but not limited to statements regarding the company's future business plans, prospects, and financial performance, are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are based on our current knowledge, expectations, and assumptions, and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, we disclaim any intent or obligation to update them.\nFor additional information on important factors and risks that could affect these expectations, please see our Form 8K filed with the SEC this morning, our annual report on Form 10K for fiscal year 2025, and our quarterly reports on Form 10Q previously filed with the SEC. Please note, in addition to our earnings release, we have also prepared a quarterly investor presentation, and both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nShould you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations Department at 804-747-0422, extension 7865. Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Tom?\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'm going to provide some perspective on our leadership changes and CEO search.\nI'll then turn the call over to David, who will review our initial observations and the actions we are taking in response. After that, Enrique and Jon will speak to our Q3 results before we open the line for your questions. As many of you know, I've been part of CarMax for more than 30 years. Over that time, we've developed a beloved brand with national scale, unmatched physical and digital infrastructure, and an award-winning culture.\nHowever, recent results have been unacceptable and do not reflect the company's potential. As a result, even though the board was already working on a succession plan, we determined that more immediate change was required and that direct involvement from David and myself was the best approach to strengthen the business in the near term. The board has been searching for a permanent CEO with urgency.\nWe are seeking a proven leader who can drive sales, maximize the benefits of our omnichannel experience, strengthen our brand, improve operations, and champion our culture. Conversations are underway, and we have some promising candidates. What is most important is that the next CEO captures the tremendous opportunity that we have in front of us.\nAs Interim Executive Chair of the Board, I'm focused on supporting David and the leadership team. David is in Richmond five days a week, and I'm spending a significant amount of time here myself. We are operating with a renewed sense of urgency to drive the business forward. I want to thank David for stepping into the Interim President and CEO role. As you know, he has served on our board since 2018. David has more than 20 years of executive leadership experience at prominent retail brands in highly competitive and fast-paced markets.\nHe has led several successful brand transformations, new omnichannel strategies, and growth initiatives for digitally native brands. What made him a great addition to our board has also been a tremendous asset in this transition. Before I turn it over to David, I also want to thank Bill Nash for his more than 30 years of service with CarMax. David?\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm honored to serve as the Interim President and CEO at this important juncture in CarMax's history. While our top priority is to find a terrific next leader, in the interim, Tom and I are committed to lead and take the steps needed to set up the next CEO for success. After three decades in the retail industry and having led multiple companies through turnarounds, I am familiar with the rigor and critical thinking required to succeed.\nThe good news is CarMax already possesses many of the vital attributes needed to turn the business and regain momentum for growth, including a well-known and trusted brand, a strong culture supported by a base of 28,000 talented associates, and an expansive digital and physical infrastructure, including over 250 premium locations that put us near 85% of the US population.\nDespite these advantages and after decades of industry leadership, based on recent results, it is clear CarMax needs change. While it has been only a few weeks in our interim roles, here are some of our observations. Prices. Our average selling prices have drifted upward and appear to be less attractive to customers. To ensure that CarMax is a preferred choice, we will work to shrink the gap between our offering and the marketplace.\nWe are lowering margins and supporting this action with marketing spend while also building out more effective ways to communicate our value to the consumer. We are also comprehensively reviewing all the costs associated with bringing a car to market. We're going to find ways to eliminate the unproductive while maintaining our reputation for having a high-quality fleet.\nAround the consumer, we need to bring an even sharper focus on the customer throughout the organization. In guiding decisions, we will reawaken our intellectual curiosity and challenge long-held institutional beliefs as we work to discover the most important elements to the customer in closing the sale. We will emphasize customer-insighted decision-making rooted in fact-based consumer research. Digital. We have the opportunity to incorporate a clearer and more effective selling voice in our digital experience.\nWhile we have spent several years building out capabilities for customers to shop how they want and where they want, we must now focus our energies on making the digital shopping experience easier and shift our digital voice from one that earnestly delivers abundant information to one that focuses on delivering sales.\nThis will drive conversion and further improve customer satisfaction, just as we do so successfully in our stores. SG&A. Similar to our approach in tackling the cost of bringing our cars to market, we believe our expense structure is too high. It is clear that we have the opportunity to leverage our technological platforms and process enhancements to reduce our spend. We are committed to sharpening our business model and eliminating unproductive costs.\nIn just a moment, Enrique will provide a progress update on the decisive actions we are taking to reduce at least $150 million in SG&A profitability. We will more aggressively tap into opportunities in the selling experience to enhance our profitability. We are excited about the outstanding growth potential we have across CAF and our ancillary products.\nYou will hear more from Jon today about our progress in full spectrum lending, as well as the steps we are taking to capture incremental flow-through in our extended protection plan business. Culture. We have always been a company intensely focused on operations. But with the advent of disruptive technologies, we now need to reignite the entrepreneurial spirit that made CarMax the industry leader for decades. Simply put, we will move faster and operate leaner while taking smart risks.\nWe are optimistic that our immediate pricing and marketing actions will improve our sales performance, but pressure earnings in the near term. As we consider the business model more holistically moving forward, we anticipate that earnings pressure will be offset by unit growth, expanded profitability in CAF and ancillary products, and through reductions in SG&A and COGS.\nTom, the board, and I believe that CarMax has many of the requisite attributes for a successful turnaround. We are confident the actions we're taking will begin to strengthen performance while the board identifies the right permanent CEO to lead CarMax for the future. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to discuss our Q3 financial performance in more detail. Enrique?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nThank you, David. During the quarter, we delivered total sales of $5.8 billion, down 6.9% compared to last year, reflecting lower volume.\nIn our retail business, total unit sales declined 8%, and used unit comps were down 9%. Pressured performance across our age zero to five inventory was partially offset by increased sales of older, higher-mileage vehicles, which represented over 40% of our sales for the quarter, an increase of approximately 5 percentage points compared to the second quarter, and last year's Q3.\nAverage selling price was $26,400, a year-over-year increase of $230 per unit. The increase was due to higher acquisition costs driven by a year-over-year increase in market prices, partially offset by the increase toward older, higher-mileage vehicles. Wholesale unit sales were down 6.2% versus the Q3 last year. Average wholesale selling price declined by $40 per unit to $8,100. We bought approximately 238,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 12% from last year.\nWe purchased approximately 208,000 vehicles from our consumers, with more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our admin sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 30,000 vehicles through dealers, which is down 9% from last year. Q3 net earnings per diluted share was $0.43 versus $0.81 a year ago.\nThis quarter was impacted by $0.08 of restructuring expenses related primarily to our CEO change and the workforce reductions in our customer experience centers. Total gross profit was $590 million, down 13% from last year's Q3. Used retail margin of $379 million decreased by 11%, driven by lower volume and profit per used unit of $2,235, in line with historical averages, though down approximately $70 per unit from last year's record high.\nWholesale vehicle margin of $115 million decreased by 17% from a year ago, with lower volume and wholesale gross profit per unit of $899, a decline of approximately $120 year over year. Both wholesale volume and margin were impacted by steep depreciation. Other gross profit was $96 million, down 16% from a year ago. This was driven primarily by the impact of lower retail unit volume on EPP.\nCarMax auto finance income was $175 million, up 9% over last year. Jon will provide detail on CAF's growth in a few moments. On the SG&A front, expenses for the Q3 were $581 million, up 1% from the prior year, driven by our previously communicated investment in marketing as we supported our new brand positioning launch and the restructuring expenses that I previously noted. These were partially offset by a reduction in the corporate bonus accrual.\nAs David noted, we are on track to achieve at least $150 million in exit rate savings by the end of fiscal year 2027. We took our first significant step toward these savings this quarter with an approximately 30% reduction in our CEC workforce. This reduction was supported by our continued process and technology enhancements, which are making our associates more efficient, as well as empowering our customers to perform more of their shopping activities themselves.\nTurning to capital allocation, during the Q3, we continued our share repurchases, buying back 4.6 million shares for a total expenditure of $202 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.36 billion of our repurchase authorization remaining. Looking forward, I'll cover two items. We are optimistic the actions of lowering margins and increasing marketing will improve our sales performance trends, but may pressure near-term earnings.\nWe expect marketing spend on a total unit basis to be up year over year in the fourth quarter, though to a lesser degree than during the Q3, with a focus on investing in acquisition to drive buys and sales. Secondly, we expect pressure on our service margins in the fourth quarter due to seasonal sales and as we annualize over cost coverage leverage taken last year. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Jon to provide more detail on CarMax auto finance and our continuing focus on full credit spectrum expansion. Jon?\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the Q3, CarMax auto finance originated $1.8 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 42.6% net of three-day payoffs versus 43.1% last year.\nWeighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11% versus 11.2% last quarter as we continued to adjust consumer rates in reaction to the broader interest rate environment. Third-party tier two volume for which we collect a fee and tier three volume for which we pay a fee combined for 24.9% of sales versus 24.4% last year. Weakness in tier two application volume, along with the impact from CAF's expansion in the tier two space, was more than offset by growth from our tier three partners.\nCAF penetration continues to benefit from underwriting and pricing adjustments implemented since the beginning of the fiscal year, estimated to be 100 to 150 basis points in the quarter. However, this volume has been offset primarily by lower application volume in the prime credit segment, along with the aforementioned tier three partner lender overperformance.\nCAF income for the quarter was $175 million, up $15 million from the same period last year. Included in the quarter is a $27 million gain on sale, along with an additional $5 million of servicing fees attributed to the closing of the 25-B deal in September. Note that while the gain on sale is fully recognized at the time of sale, servicing fee income will continue over the remaining life of the deal and will be proportional to the receivable volume remaining.\nNet interest margin on the portfolio was flat year over year and down to 6.2% from 6.6% last quarter, and largely reflects the higher margin receivables removed from the balance sheet as a part of 25-B. CAF had a loan loss provision of $73 million, resulting in a total reserve balance of $475 million, or 2.87% of auto loans held for investment.\nLosses observed during the quarter were in line with our expectations, upon which we based our reserve at the end of Q2. With regard to growing the CAF business, I'm immensely proud of our accomplishments today. Over the last 18 months, we have greatly expanded our funding options, including this quarter's off-balance sheet transaction, which have been critical prerequisites to this growth.\nIn addition, we continue to add underwriting capabilities and modeling refinements that will support profitable expansion. Separately, I am also excited about the significant future earnings potential from both our redesigned MaxCare plan, which focuses on mechanical coverage, and our new MaxCare Plus plan, which focuses on cosmetic protection. These products have already migrated from test phase to pilot in multiple markets, and we expect to achieve near nationwide rollout during Q1 of FY27. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to David. David?\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nThank you, Enrique. Thank you, Jon. Today, we outlined our initial observations and near-term priorities to drive improvement: shrinking the price gap between our offering in the marketplace with a stronger focus on customer experience, increasing digital monetization capabilities, reducing costs, enhancing profitable growth drivers, and improving the speed of decision-making. And while we are realistic about the near-term challenges, CarMax's competitive foundation remains strong.\nWe have a trusted brand, national scale that is difficult to replicate, leading omnichannel capabilities and growing digital infrastructure, a strong financing platform in CAF, and an award-winning culture. Our execution has not matched the potential of these assets, but that's what's changing. Tom, the board, and I are focused on strengthening performance and creating a solid foundation for the permanent CEO to build upon. We appreciate your continued confidence in CarMax and are committed to being transparent about our progress.\nWith that, we'll open the line for questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. To leave the queue at any time, press star two. Once again, that is star and one to ask a question. And your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open. You may now ask your question.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nPartner and Group Head of the Consumer Sector, William Blair\n\nGood morning. Good to hear you again, Tom, on a conference call. And welcome, David, to the world of CarMax conference calls. Thank you, Sharon. Yeah. I guess maybe if you could give some color on the magnitude of the GPU reset that you're looking to see here in the February quarter.\nAnd then as you look at the business, kind of I guess with a fresher perspective, are there any customer cohorts that you can delve into where you think somehow CarMax has become a bit less competitive or a bit less attractive? And what's the game plan to win those customers back?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. Sharon, hey, it's Enrique. Let me jump in. The margin reductions, which are going to be supported with acquisition spend on marketing, will be meaningful in our design just to narrow the gap that we talked about with the broader marketplace. And we're optimistic that those can actually improve our retail sales trends into the quarter. But they're big enough for us to talk about. And we're going to see how they roll out. We're going to see the impact within this quarter.\nThen when we have our year-end call in April, we'll provide insight and an outlook on what those margin reductions and marketing spend increase mean to us.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nYeah. Sharon, this is Jon. I'll jump into your customer cohort question. Yeah. I think there's obviously places across the spectrum that we're looking to improve and grow sales. One in particular that stands out for me is if you look at maybe the higher FICO segments, we mentioned in the prepared remarks sort of in CAF and the Tier 2 section, that maybe 650 to 750 space feels like we've lost volume there. We can track that through application volume coming through the door and then progression further on. So a lot of speculation around what that could be. Certainly, we're going to look at all things. David mentioned a number of things, pricing.\nObviously, we try and keep our rates competitive, just overall the offering that we provide the consumer. But I think that's one spot in particular that I think there's a lot of chance to recapture and fuel our growth.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nPartner and Group Head of the Consumer Sector, William Blair\n\nCan I ask a follow-up? You have a competitor who will be kind of lowering finance rates proactively in the current quarter to reinvest some of their GPU to the customer. I think historically you followed the market on finance rates. Would there be something you'd be willing to do on interest rates to kind of weaponize that a bit more to gain more conversion?\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nSure. I appreciate that question. Yeah. I think we're always keeping the pulse on the markets, looking at how we compare to obviously credit unions, banks, and what have you, and certainly competitors as well to the degree we can measure that. Yeah.\nI'm not going to speak to what they're going to do. But we think our APRs are quite competitive with the Fed making the moves that they've had to make. We will adjust accordingly. We always have a test-and-learn methodology there. I'm not going to say we're going to try and get further ahead of the market. But I still think in maybe this space, there is a gap in interest rates that still exist, although it might be closing. But I think it's the broader offering question. How do we compare from an interest rate standpoint, certainly in maybe term, but obviously couple that with what's the price of the car and all the other fees associated with that? So I think the bigger offering picture is the one that's really going to be the focus here.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nSharon, what I'd say, looking at it a bit more broadly as well, is that the reductions in SG&A, so these are levers that we've talked about, the reductions in SG&A, the focus on COGS, growth opportunities in CAF in full spectrum, as well as EPP products that Jon talked about and what we're happy to elaborate on. Those are all levers that bring to bear an ability to be more competitive in the marketplace. At the same time, we're reevaluating, as David talked about, reevaluating how we go to market, right? How we go to market, as Jon mentioned, it's the kind of cars, it's the price of the cars, it's how we communicate on our website. It's all of those items.\nAnd so we do think we have levers at this point that are lining up to be materially more competitive and to go to market with.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nPartner and Group Head of the Consumer Sector, William Blair\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning, everyone. So historically, I'm going to take another shot at this GPU question. Historically, I believe the management teams have talked about needing to lower prices by about $500 per unit to see a real inflection in the sales pace. So that would obviously be meaningful to use Enrique's words. So is that in the range of how you guys are thinking about reducing your GPU?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. What I'd say is I don't think we've said $500 is a meaningful or a needed amount to drive sales. We do price elasticity testing. We're always in the market doing price elasticity testing.\nI'd tell you the number to move sales is well south of that. In terms of what we're doing this quarter, look, we're trying different things. We are going out. It was, again, sizable for us to talk about on this call. We're going to test the impact on sales, again, in combination with an increase in marketing, kind of get a boost there overall. We're going to report out in the fourth quarter call in April and communicate what we saw in the market. We're optimistic it's going to change the trend in sales. I wouldn't say that $500 is what we need to move sales, if that's what you're saying.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you. Then just to follow up, if I can, I guess it's a bigger picture question for Tom and David.\nWhat do you think CarMax represents to consumers today in late 2025, given some of the alternatives that are out there? And where do you think you would like to end up in, call it, two to three years? Thank you.\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nHey there. Nice to talk to you, David, here. We think many of the things that CarMax has meant to the customers in the past can continue to be. We believe we're a leading used car destination for customers. We've invested a lot of money, time, and effort in building and broadening those capabilities to be able to let them shop where they want and how they want. And ultimately, we believe we're the most trusted brand out there.\nThe differences in where we've been and the performance we need to adjust to, and adjust our model towards getting to, and have confidence we're going to be able to get there in the near term.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nHey, Scott. It's Tom. Good to talk to you again. From my perspective, and I'm a little biased, over the last 30 years, we've built an iconic brand. And I don't think that's changed at all. I think the consumer knows what we represent. They know the quality that we represent. I think our associates in our stores, in our CECs, and across the board are completely engaged and ready to serve the customer. We've spent a lot of money investing so that we could serve the customer however they want to be served, whether it's online or in our stores. And I just think we need to activate that.\nWe need to do a better job of presenting that to the customer upfront. But in terms of the brand and the strength and the quality of our vehicles, all that stuff is fully intact. And I think it's the basis for us moving forward and a basis from which we can grow again.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. And happy holidays.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nThank you, Scot. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will move next with Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCraig Kennison\n\nSenior Analyst and Director of Research Operations, Baird\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the SG&A topic, what is the baseline SG&A from which you expect to cut $150 million? Just curious so that we can track your performance against that goal.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. No, absolutely. And so when we talk about our SG&A goal of a $150 million reduction, it's a reduction of SG&A opportunities.\nThat's really comparing it to last year, if you will. So if you want to use, our base was $2.5 billion, right, roughly. And so that's what we're using as a baseline. And those are the reductions that we're going after.\n\nCraig Kennison\n\nSenior Analyst and Director of Research Operations, Baird\n\nAnd that is an exit run rate as of Q4 of fiscal 2027?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nExactly.\n\nCraig Kennison\n\nSenior Analyst and Director of Research Operations, Baird\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRajat Gupta\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. And thanks for the candid assessment on the prepared remarks. I had a follow-up on just the margin versus same store expectation. Could you give us any sort of early read? Because we got the sense that last quarter, also, there was some effort to become more price competitive.\nAnything you can give us in terms of early reads in December and how those actions have already started to show some results? Or is it still very early? Or have you not implemented them yet? And what kind of equation are we looking at in terms of dollar versus same store volume trade-off, dollar GPU versus same store volume trade-off? Any more insight you can give us on how you see this equation playing out? And have a very quick follow-up. Thanks.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nHey, Rajat. So we just rolled out the price changes. So it is too early to provide any kind of insight into that. And again, we will provide a view into that in a Q4 call. But we literally just rolled out those changes, so. Rolling them. They're underway. Yeah. And they're underway. Actually, that's a good point. They're not fully rolled out. They're underway.\nBut we just started this week, so.\n\nRajat Gupta\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nIs the hope to go back to share gains or positive unit growth? I mean, what kind of the expected outcome in the near term?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. No, look, we are optimistic that this lever that we're pulling, and again, it's really the combination, right, of having lower margins, lower prices out there being more price competitive, supporting it with acquisition marketing, right? So think of paid search, other direct levers like that, directly to support sales is going to change the trend of our performance. So we just reported a negative nine comp. Last quarter was a little better than that, but not great. And our goal is to change the trend and to get the sales flywheel going. And that's what we're looking to do.\nAnd at the same time, we're working really hard on getting other profitability metrics or levers, I should say, in place. And again, those things are SG&A reductions, COGS reductions, EPP growth, CAF full spectrum, so CAF income growth over time. These are all levers that we're pulling because our goal is to drive sales over time, absolutely, and to drive earnings power over time as well.\n\nRajat Gupta\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nJust a quick follow-up on CAF. It looks like, as you mentioned, third-party tier two penetration went up. Is there any meaningful tightening effort going on right now? I'm curious how those reserves will change going forward once you go back to having more in-house tier three, tier two type penetration. Or maybe any color you can give us on just CAF provisions in the fourth quarter would be helpful as well.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nThanks. Sure. Yeah. I appreciate the question, Rajat. Yeah.\nI don't think there's a tremendous story in the tier two, tier three. We always just provide the numbers and provide a little guidance to set the delta there. But there's always swapping between maybe a tier two lender that is choosing to be a little more aggressive or doing tightening.\nAgain, they're going to make their own individual decisions versus the tier three partner that, again, may be the recipient of that tightening higher upstream or, again, being a little looser on their side. So I don't think there's a meaningful story there, just to clarify, just really providing the numbers. And ultimately, to your second question, I don't think that I wouldn't read much into that in terms of CAF provision. Again, we're, as we stated, very, very excited about our opportunity as we go down into the tier two spectrum.\nJust for a point to note, we were over 10% of the Tier 2 volume came to CAF this quarter. We went after. And so we're really excited about that. And as we continue to go further spectrum, we're generally operating in the higher 50% of Tier 2. But we think we can get the entirety of that credit spectrum as we methodically roll out refinement store model. We're excited about the funding solutions we have in place. And so we will reserve for it accordingly. And we will enjoy the income, and we will get there.\n\nRajat Gupta\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks. Thanks for all the color, and good luck.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Tom, welcome back to the calls. Hey, Brian. Thanks. Look, this is going to be potentially repetitive.\nI want to make this point across. We're talking about pricing and being more aggressive in pricing here. For as long as I can remember, and I've talked to CarMax for some time now, you've done these pricing tests. The message from CarMax has always been the same, is that they really lower prices, but the net result has not been favorable. I guess that long ask is you're talking about, once again, either testing or moving forward with lower prices and accepting lower GPUs. What's different this time? Why do you think that this will this time around is going to be different than the past, which actually can drive better unit volume?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. I think in the past, look, when we've lowered our prices and we do price elasticity all the time, right, Brian? We talk about that.\nI think the equation in the past has been you lower your prices, and then when you flow it through to the business, do you make enough money to offset the lower margin with increase in sales? It absolutely drives sales, right? But the equation was, well, it didn't always drive enough profit. I think the difference, absolutely right now, there's a clear difference.\nThe clear difference is that we have strong levers that are now supporting to look at the business more holistically. So again, think of the reduction in SG&A, that aggressive cuts we're going after. You think of COGS and how aggressive we're going after COGS. You think of EPP growth. You think of CAF full spectrum income growth. These are all levers that are offset. Some of that pressure we had seen when we looked solely at the impact of lowering prices.\nSo there's absolutely a difference. And we're just looking at the business a bit more holistically. And we have those levers at hand here.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nYeah. And Brian, I would just add that, as Enrique mentioned, we've always talked about it in terms of total profitability. When we do price changes, we definitely see some sales movement. And then we've always had kind of the guardrails around what total profitability is. I would just tell you that our focus in the near term, given our current performance, is to drive sales and to get things moving in the other direction. The other thing to remember is when we say we're going to lower prices $100 or $200, it doesn't mean we're taking $100 across the board on cars.\nIt's more like, if we say $100, think of it as 10% of our car is $1,000 or 5% of our car is $500. So it meaningfully impacts the trajectory of sales because of the way we execute price changes. But back to our near-term priority is to get things turned around and get sales moving in the other direction.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you. Then just a follow-up, sorry, David. But with regard to marketing, so you talked about, if I understand correctly, a stepped-up marketing now. So to say, press down the gas a little bit more. When you think about it, is it more of the same, or is CarMax really working on coming to market with a new marketing message?\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nSo yeah, good question. Thank you. So what we're doing is taking the new campaign was launched recently as the team took it through.\nWhat we're focusing on now in the near term is sort of optimizing the campaign we have with the results and tests we have. So shifting things that are going to drive more conversion, messaging, perhaps some of the and dialing back, perhaps, some of the brand longer-term spend on it. But ultimately, we think the review and positioning of the campaign is really something for the new CEO who's going to align it with the new strategy. We're working with the existing campaign and resources we have right now. But the team has been working to optimize the results based on media, based on geographies, and based on messaging.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nThanks, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Daniela Haigian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDaniela Haigian\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning, Tom, David.\nAppreciate your color in the prepared remarks. My first question is on that digital redefining the digital platform. What specifically within that needs to change to drive more of a selling experience? And how does that impact the operating cost structure with your store base? What would be early indicators of progress in that redefinition?\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nYeah. So we'll take the first part of the question first. We have worked very diligently over the years to build the capability set. But we have not been as focused yet on the next stage, which is to make it easier. Look, shopping online with us is not easy. We have ways to streamline it, and we have ways to make the digital selling voice really just like our sales associates in the stores, make it easier to bring to get them to the ultimate sale.\nAnd the ultimate satisfaction is finding a car they like that they can afford. We recognize that with all the good work that's been done, it's still not an easy experience. So in our earnest efforts to provide information and countless options, we still have opportunity to streamline it, bring it there.\nThen in terms of the impact downstream, we'll work in lockstep with the organization and the field to figure out what those best options are. As both John mentioned and Enrique mentioned earlier, we have an opportunity to look holistically at our business model from our COGS, our SG&A, our messaging, and all those components. That includes how we make decisions, not necessarily individually, but more holistically in what that means for an offer for the customer so that we don't lose sight of what's most important to them.\nBut I would expect you're going to see some of the changes. Tom and I would expect you'll see some of the changes. It'll be iterative in the next month or two. You'll see it, and we'll continue after that. But you should see the efforts are underway, and the team's very excited about this next step in that digital journey and how important it is in linking with the field team. Very symbiotic.\n\nDaniela Haigian\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Got it. That's helpful. And appreciate your transparency there. My follow-up is on COGS, right? You and Enrique, you keep calling out COGS as a key lever. What's the strategy with reducing that line item? And are you still progressing towards that regional reconditioning center approach?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. I would tell you, look, we have been focused on COGS for, I mean, we're always focused on COGS.\nWhat we've done is that we've called it out over the past couple of years. Last year, we had communicated a goal of $125 per unit. We hit that goal this year. We had communicated, again, another goal of $125 per unit. I would tell you, given where sales are or have been for the past two quarters, we're probably a little bit behind that goal. Not because the initiatives aren't there and the teams aren't doing great work.\nIt's just because you delever in a tough sales environment. But we will continue to put even more accelerated goals internally to go after COGS opportunities. Some of that is through the reconditioning centers, right? Some of that, for I'll give you a real example. We just rolled out a parts selection tool in our stores. We're already seeing benefits from that, right?\nReally kind of forcing our associates in the stores to pick balance, speed with quality, with cost, and making it really easy for our associates to do that. We're seeing results fairly immediately. That's just an example of items we're focused on in COGS. In terms of the reconditioning centers, yeah, we've rolled out at this point in time five. Only two of them have been open for about a year.\nSo it's still kind of early to tell what the goals are. I mean, the ultimate goal is absolutely to get them more efficient. We're already seeing logistics savings in the system because we've rolled these things out. We expect that those will perform in line with some of our larger reconditioning units that we have in stores like Murrieta in LA that we've seen there.\nHighly efficient store because of the volume that we pump through. And we have the same expectations with these more regional reconditioning centers. But again, we've only rolled out a few at this point in time.\n\nDaniela Haigian\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nAmericas Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Tom, nice to talk to you again. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned reassessing the cost of bringing a car to market. What about the time to turn vehicles? CarMax has been a leader in that area for a long time. Looks like some competitors have increased their speed to market pretty dramatically.\nIs there anything you guys can do around AI implementation, cut down that timeline, use your 30-plus years of data, and potentially avoid some of those sharper depreciation swings that have disrupted the business over the last few quarters? How should we think about that opportunity?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. I think, look, we're always focused on reconditioning, on speed, on lowering our WIP. For example, this quarter, we increased our sellable inventory and decreased our overall inventory, right? So that's really a strong focus on WIP. That actually, this quarter helped our turns relative to last year despite comps being down 9%. So you can see the organizational focus on just getting better in terms of turning vehicles. I think our off-site reconditioning locations will help as well because we'll be even more efficient. So just a couple of examples there in terms of the focus moving forward.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nAmericas Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nAnd Enrique, maybe the second question is, can you update us on the real estate strategy? Anything that's changing there? You guys own a lot of your real estate. Is that a potential area where you could monetize and use that to fund more investment in the business if you need to?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. Look, I think it always is a potential. We own a lot of our sites out there for our store locations. I would tell you we have better sources of capital versus doing a sale lease back or something. So we have great banking relationships, great partners out there, capital providers. And we have a revolver, a $2 billion revolver we can dip in there. And just more efficient ways to get capital for us rather than kind of monetize our stores or the land under our stores.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nAmericas Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Bottiglieri\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one, more clearer call, I suppose, and then just a bigger question. Did you give the service profit? I think it was $4 million last quarter. Just curious what that was for Q3. Is that a good run rate for Q4 given volumes are pretty similar Q4 versus Q3? And then my actual question, can you just elaborate what's happening with the credit penetration? It sounds like the prime side, I suppose, you're seeing less appraisal traffic or less traffic coming in. I would think that with a K-shaped economy, that's probably the healthier side of the market. Just kind of curious what's causing that, what you're seeing there. Thank you.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nDo you want to do that one first? No, I'll jump in.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nYeah, that's fine. Chris, this is Jon. I'll take the credit side. Yeah. As we noted in the remarks and even reflecting on Sharon's question, when we look across the credit spectrum, we really can gauge who's coming and shopping with us through our pre-qual product, is a great place to do it. Customers love it. They take full advantage of it. 80+% of our customers start with credit online.\nI think we see definitely an opportunity in that sort of 650 to 750 credit space. As I mentioned earlier, hard to speculate what's driving that. Is that we think our rates are quite competitive there. But it's always a question of inventory, price, availability, all of that. I think, as we mentioned on this call, holistically, all of that is up for discussion, and we're going to look at improving our overall offering there.\nSo while we say K-shaped economy, ultimately, we do see those folks probably are less stressed by affordability. We want to make sure we have the right product at the right price at the right time for them when they're ready to purchase. So I think there's improvement there. That's really what the comments, I think, are in that space are.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. And regarding service, in the quarter, there definitely was pressure in service, as you know. And as we've talked about, it is a line item service margin that deleverages when sales are more challenged. But look, over the past couple of years, the teams have made material strides in service margin over the past couple of years. And we had even talked at the beginning of this year that we expected to be, I think, slightly positive for the year in service margin.\nCertainly, our sales expectations at that point in time were not where we are currently actualizing. But I'll tell you, for the full year, our outlook right now is maybe a little unprofitable or a little profitable, depending on sales performance in Q4. And that just tells you the incredible work the teams are doing for service margin there.\nBut we did have a negative margin in Q3. And we do expect, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, some pressure in Q4. We'll be comping over some cost coverage that we took last year. But again, if I take a step back and I look more holistically at it, the teams have done tremendous work. It's going to be borderline whether or not we hit that positive margin for the full year.\nBut again, sales have been definitely more pressured than what we had anticipated versus the beginning of the year.\n\nChris Bottiglieri\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will move next with John Babcock with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Babcock\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess just first of all, I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about what the board is looking for in its next CEO and also how we should think about timing in terms of when something might be announced there, recognizing that might be variable.\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nYeah. I would just tell you it's the board's highest priority right now. It's my personal single highest priority as I'm leading the search along with the rest of the search committee. We're looking for somebody that has led a complex business with a diverse set of assets.\nWe're hoping to find somebody that's also led some type of a digital transformation. Doesn't have to come from automotive necessarily. Doesn't necessarily have to come from retail. But one of the most important things is that it's somebody who understands our culture and can lead this team onto the next phase of our success. In terms of timing, we're moving as quickly as we can, but I don't really have an update on timing.\n\nJohn Babcock\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Totally fair. And then next, at least based on the work that you've been doing over the last couple of months and even in knowing the business, I was just wondering, how are you thinking about the omnichannel business? I mean, do you think this is kind of the setup that you want to keep longer term? Do you think you want to shift more towards digital over time?\nWhat's the benefit of omnichannel versus digital or pursuing more of a brick-and-mortar strategy?\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nI think for us, it's really all of the above. Over the last several years, as the team has been communicating, we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars in our infrastructure and giving us the capabilities to meet the customer wherever they want to be.\nI think having a national physical footprint is an advantage for us, over 250 locations, as David mentioned in the beginning of the call, near 85% of the US population. So I think it's more of an all of the above strategy. I think some of the comments you've heard today is that we're not happy with how we present to the customer from a digital standpoint. I think you'll see us make some significant improvements there.\nBut we think our stores are extremely valuable, and our store teams do a great job converting customers once we get them in the store. But we clearly need to get better on the digital side.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax",
    "content2": "Yeah. And just to add a little color to Tom's comments on that, again, CarMax has built out so many capabilities. And now when we are talking about holistically looking at our business model, we've built out so many potential capabilities, and many of them are helpful. But some of them probably are adding clearly decisions we've made, things we're trying to do, and our best efforts to please everything for every customer.\nWe have an opportunity to streamline, make some decisions, prioritize some things based on real quantified insight from the consumer in ways that we can streamline and optimize the advantages that omni should provide versus getting caught in some of the complexities that omni also provides. So I think you'll see that in the near term as the team sort of finishes that infrastructure build-out, but then gets to really sharpen it and hone it into a competitive advantage.\n\nJohn Babcock\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thank you. That's very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will move next with Jeff Lick with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Lick\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Stephens Inc\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question, Tom. It is absolutely awesome to hear your voice. So listen, David, a question for you. You've been a senior leader at retail organizations that were digitally native and also retail organizations that are kind of a hybrid.\nThey have a physical business and a digital business. I was wondering if you could speak to the challenges of CarMax as a hybrid business where there are people that are wedded to the physical part of the business, and there's some natural tension which makes it more difficult to have an ideal digital business.\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nYeah. Jeff, great insight. And thank you for that question. Yeah. There are examples of that. And that's a little bit of what I was alluding to. Now, recognize, Tom and I have been in the chair for two and a half weeks or so. But the most important things I see is that the team's very excited about breaking through, and it's an incredibly talented and dedicated group.\nWe just need to work across those channels to make sure we're putting the customer at front of those decisions and not having the operational biases or legacy approaches come through. So there is not a battle between one version versus another. But what we need to do is provide some leadership and focus to the team so we can start executing more with that. What's most important to the customer?\nStreamline, make sure it's a competitive offer because we know we own the brand, and we know we own the trust in a great part of the American consumer. But you're absolutely right. Many organizations, Omni causes them to trip up. I would say we're just going through finishing sort of like an awkward adolescence, and we'll be moving into a much more refined effort in the upcoming time.\nNow, that being said, you'll want to confirm that answer with the new CEO when they come in. But in the interim, that's why we're so optimistic about the improvement because we have so many of the components already in place.\n\nJeff Lick\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Stephens Inc\n\nI was just wondering if we could quick double back to Sharon's first question about potential cohorts that you might have lost or been less effective with. I don't think she was thinking about necessarily the buyer FICO score. This kind of gets into the advertising strategy. Tom, just wondering, back in the day, it always seemed like you over-indexed with that young professional, likely a female, that didn't want to go into the franchise dealer and do battle. You provided a much more easy professional experience.\nDo you think that your primary competitor has maybe cut you off at the pass and has even done a better job of providing an experience for that person where it's like, \"Look, now it's super easy\"? Is that where you?\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nYour question about cohorts, the second quarter, we were down 6%. Last quarter, we were down 9%. So we need to improve across the board. I would just go back to the comments we've already made. We're not as easy as we need to be for the consumer. We need to simplify our processes. It's so easy to buy stuff online. It doesn't matter what it is these days. And it's true for automotive. It's not just true for one or two competitors. It's across the board.\nAnd again, we've invested the money to put ourselves in a position to be the best at this, and we got some work to do to get there. But we need to simplify for the consumer how they go through the process with us, whether it's on our website or in our app or in our stores.\n\nJeff Lick\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Stephens Inc\n\nFair enough. Best of luck. And look forward to hearing from you again.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nThanks, Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will move next with Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Pierce\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham\n\nHey. Sort of following up, good morning, on Jeff's thought there. I guess, do you think you have the customer base that wants to do more of the work online to sort of drive an OpEx offset in GPUs? Or do you need to reposition the brand to get younger? Or would you sort of reject that framing?\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nCan you say that again?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nSorry, we missed that.\n\nOperator\n\nI'm just curious, do you think you have the customer base that wants to do more of the work online? Do you think you need to get younger with this new ad campaign? Or do you think it's just about pricing and the experience you're offering?\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nI absolutely think we have the customer base that wants to do more of the process online. By the way, the younger you go, the less money you have, and the less likely you are to have the credit required to buy a car that's $26,000. But I think we have plenty of customer flow, and we need to take better advantage of it.\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nAs David and Tom talked about, look, we have enviable assets, right? We have an awareness level that's off the charts.\nWe have consumers that are extremely loyal and that love our brand. We have associates that are outstanding. We have more than 250 stores across the country that operate extremely well. We have a strong. We've invested in the digital capabilities. We just need to kind of fine-tune how those things mesh together. But in terms of whether or not we have customers out there that want to buy us, I would tell you, absolutely. That's not the concern that we have. The opportunity that we have is to make our offering based on the consumer the most compelling that we can make it. And that's what we're focused on.\n\nChris Pierce\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham\n\nOkay. Thank you and good luck.\n\nJon Daniels\n\nEVP of Auto Finance, CarMax\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will move next with Michael Montani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Montani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And Tom, good to hear from you again as well.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael Montani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nJust wanted to dig into. I guess it's a three-parter, but it's kind of all related, which was depreciation trends, just some incremental color about what you're seeing. The competitive backdrop was the intensity ratcheting up. And then lastly was on the reinvestment into GPU. How much of a reinvestment we ought to be thinking about moving ahead?\n\nEnrique Mayor-Mora\n\nEVP and CFO, CarMax\n\nYeah. Look, separate depreciation. My comments were really in the wholesale area, right? We did see very sharp depreciation within the quarter, greater than 10% depreciation within the quarter. So very sharp. And that impacted performance within the quarter. But as that abates, then we would expect that performance would turn around. In terms of GP, we did talk about that. Look, it's material enough for us to talk about it on the call. But at the same time, we've just rolled out different levels of pricing changes.\nWe're going to see kind of how it performs within the quarter. Then in our Q4 call, we'll come back, and we'll talk about what we saw and also what that means for our plan moving forward. I say that, but we're also optimistic that it's going to change the sales trend that we've had, negative six, negative nine comps sequentially. That's what we're looking to change. We're looking to change that trend. We'll come back with that. I forget your number two question, but that's three-parter.\n\nMichael Montani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nJust the competitive intensity.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nI'm looking at number one and number three. Yeah. Let me add to the pricing part, which is our pricing is not, it's not like we have a static pricing model where we just lower all of our prices and leave them there. This is going to be very dynamic throughout the quarter.\nI think one of the things David and I and the rest of the team here assessed in a short period of time is if you want to get things moving in the other direction, there's some significant levers that you can push, but the two biggest are clearly pricing and marketing. So we're making moves there to try to get the trend moving in the other direction. But it'll be very dynamic throughout the quarter. It's why we're not trying to be evasive with what we think the margin impact will be, but we're trying to be as impactful as we can. And again, we're 18 days into the quarter. So this will be a dynamic process throughout the next three months.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And we don't have any further questions at this time. I will hand the call back to David for any closing remarks.\n\nDavid McCreight\n\nInterim President and CEO, CarMax\n\nThank you.\nWe'd like to thank the thousands of CarMax associates who have helped build the business that we have today and will be part of our next leg of growth in the future. Thank you all for joining our call today. And then before we sign off, Tom has some closing remarks.\n\nTom Folliard\n\nInterim Executive Chair of the Board, CarMax\n\nYeah. I just thank all of you guys for your support. Many of you, I know and have heard your voice in the past. And although it's good to be back, I wish it was under slightly different circumstances. But what I would tell you is, from the board perspective, we are absolutely committed to getting this right. David is the perfect person to sit in this role while we search for our next CEO. I'm happy to spend more time on the business.\nWhat I've been most enthusiastic about in the last two weeks is how engaged all of our employees are and how excited they are to win. As we've mentioned multiple times, and Enrique just kind of covered in total, we have incredible assets in this company. We have a great balance sheet.\nWe have an iconic brand. We have 250 locations. And most importantly, what has always separated us from everybody else is the engagement of our more than 28,000 associates. None of that has wavered. So I just wanted to close by saying the board is absolutely committed to getting this right. I wanted to also thank David for the role that he is playing while we're in the middle of this search. Lastly, I wish everybody a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us. We'll talk to you next time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q3 fiscal year 2026 CarMax earnings release conference call. You may now disconnect."
